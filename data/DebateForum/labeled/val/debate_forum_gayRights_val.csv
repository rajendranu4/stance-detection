"Just let gay people do what they want. I do not support gay people, but that doesn't mean I want their rights taking away from them. I mean we live in the ""Land of the free"",right?",1
"What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature   Ignoring the fact that we actually do find many instances of homosexuality in the animal kingdom and thus nature....  You're violating the naturalistic fallacy. You assume that something which is natural is inherently ""good"" and something not natural is ""bad"".  If you can show me where in nature we find skyscrapers and microchips....that would be great! Because these things aren't exactly natural either. Yet something like cannibalism is actually pretty common in nature.",1
Are you going to leave me alone or what?,0
"I'm not telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights. I'm telling them to take a different tactic. If you say that they are already doing that, then great.   Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?   Why should they carter to gays who are intolerant of their belief?  By  forcing people  who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance a fight will break out. You claim that it is wrong for people to  forcing gays  into a situation where they can't get married but you have no qualms about  forcing people  into accepting gays. WTF, soccer? If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.  My point is that it is wrong to force anyone into anything they don't want to do; period. My solution is to go around those people. Not force them into doing it my way.  And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights   You can't legislate morality. That's the part that drives me up the wall. Someone telling me that something should or should not be legal because it is or isn't morally right. Sometimes the person talking to me about morals is an atheists or is pro-abortion. It drives me insane. Who are you to dictate your morals to me? You don't want me to dictate my morals to you. Why is it a one way street with you?  Just because ""gays want to get married"" does not make it  a right , nor does it make it  morally right  (or wrong for that matter), nor do gays necessarily suffer if they don't get to marry.  The fact that ""gays being allowed to marry doesn't hurt anyone"" is not a logical argument for gay marriage because I can just as easily say, ""It doesn't hurt anyone if gays don't get married.""   There are savages living in the bush that don't know from marriage as we know it. They live together, do what comes naturally, and that's that. they don't have a piece of paper that says they are married.  If a gay couple do not have a piece of paper that says that they are married, how are they hurt? They are not hurt. They just don't get ""extra"" benefits. If I have a piece of candy and you want it and I don't give it to you, you are not hurt, you just don't have a piece of candy, you don't have something extra, you don't have something you didn't have to begin with. So how are you hurt?  Now, if I take something away from you, then you have a legitimate gripe. These marriage benefits are not taken away from gays. These marriage benefits are just  not given  to gay couples. If gays want those benefits then fight for those benefits. But don't give me some sob story about how gays are hurt because you aren't given something they want.  Oh, but they want the same thing as heterosexual couples. Hell, I want a million dollars. CEO's get a million dollars all the time. Am I hurt because I'm not given a million dollars? Am I right in asking for a million dollars? I never had a million dollars before. Do I have a right to a million dollars? Am I suffering? Does it hurt anyone if I were given a million dollars? Why can't I have my million dollars? Maybe I should just figure out how to get a million dollars on my own. WOW!!! What a freaking concept!!! I have control over getting a million dollars!!! And I'm willing to bet every penny of it that once I get it, it wont necessarily make me any happier than I am already, right now.  This crap about wanting to express their love in front of friends and family can be expressed without a legal piece of paper. If you want a legal piece of paper in order for it to mean something, go to a lawyer and have him draw something up. You want commitment? Then specify what it is you expect to get out of the union during and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Specify exactly what it is you are willing to give up during the relationship and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Then, if it doesn't pan out, come and tell me how happy that piece of paper made you feel.",0
"Gay marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase ""gay marriage"" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.  The phrase ""gay marriage"" is itself an attack on the traditional meaning of the word ""marriage"". The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.  Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.  A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.  The new practice of what may be called a ""homosexual union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.  In particular, the practice of calling this ""gay marriage"" does harm both to the word ""gay"", and to the word ""marriage"", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""gay"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""happy""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.  It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.  In conclusion, the phrase ""gay marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""gay marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word ""marriage"" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be ""homosexual union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"". Finally, by unequivocating the meaning of the words used, much unnecessary disagreement and wasted debate could be avoided.",0
"I am very surprised that you would opt to oppose an argument of mine so soon after our last debate. Perhaps you enjoyed the debate? Letâ€™s see where round number two shall lead the discourse.   You asserted: The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective.  You state that my argument has a problem; however, you then move onto affirming that my view of evolution is of a simplistic perspective. Your proposition is identical in principle to the following proposition:   The problem with your car is that you are looking at the gas cap from the wrong side.   Both propositions are simply irrational.  Moreover, instead of identifying the problem of my argument, your argument proceeds to make claims that have not been syllogistically demonstrated. The argument presumes that the audience grants the propositions without argument; unless of course your argument is purely hypothetical. And lastly, there is an abundance of uncertainty in your argument, which in turn calls into question the wherefore of asserting such things.  A. They may make  B. More likely  C. Fairly obvious  D. Must be  E. More likely  F. No definitive proof  G. The possibility is a strong one  Do you simply want to engage in a debate? If so, name the subject-matter.

I don't know if you have kids or where recently in school but the government is hiring people to get to the point long before the parents even want to think about it. Most straight parents don't even explain this stuff to their kids anymore either because they don't care or because they say one word and the kid says 'Yeah mom/dad I know. Remember that paper you signed last week giving the school permission to teach me that crap? Yeah please don't go there.'  What about single parents? They do it by themselves and to be quite frank I would find it more akward as a single straight parent then a gay couple who don't find any atraction to that sex what so ever. So how bout you through that argument in a single parents face and see if you still have a face when they're done with you.,1
In my own personal feeling i think they should be able do adopt. Why can they have the wonders and joys that other people get to experience that they want in their lives. Its just not right picture if you were in their situation and you wanted a child what would you do? I would go out and adopt a kid because sometime you need kids to make your life more exciting. Maybe they don't want to leave the earth without a memory of them so if they gays want to adopt feel free because you have my support.,1

"Okay, so the behavior of the minority is abnormal, abnormal is deviant, and deviant behavior often isn't  accepted  by the majority. This is what you've established, and I don't disagree with it. But nowhere have you done anything to show why the behavior of the minority is unethical and immoral simply because it is deviant. You haven't shown abnormal behavior to be unacceptable, just stated that it is frequently unaccepted - by people like you.  I suppose the once deviant notion that a woman's word was equal to that of a man's, the abnormal view that women should be allowed to vote and own property was just ""a slide of hands"" by the women's rights movement. And, of course, if we apply your logic evenly, this makes them immoral and unethical for perpetrating deviant behavior. Godforbid we see it as social progress, it was something new and different, how could it be?   Your slippery slope argument comes off more like paranoia. If you cant make the distinction between rape and homosexuality simply because they are both actions of the minority, you must live in a very frightening world.",1
"Because you are calling an entire group of people immoral for no other reason then that they are attracted to people of the same sex.

Not romantic love.    Because you believe, without any actual basis, that homosexual parents are incapable of raising a child correctly.   That's not true, but a father and a mother is the  only  correct way to have a family.    The Family, A Proclamation To The World    Because when I ask you why these act are immoral, your only response is to quote a bible verse.   What's so bad about the Bible?    And most importantly you allow these baseless views to interfere with other American's pursuit of happiness by denying them rights.   What can I do that they can't do? Get married? Sure they can.

But I do want to force you to  tolerate  it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   early death (@45yrs of age) high rates of infectious diseases, depression and suicide is really a good thing   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just  is . Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude. That's a separate issue though.  Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.

They just choose not to exercise them   Like what?   Were is the discrimination in that?   They are prohibited from being married, something that, by the constitution, should be granted. Please see miscegenation case law: Lovings v Virginia, which overturned Pace v Alabama.   If the state issues a license, gives tax incentives, sets up family courts and all the other benefits they extend; I think I would consider that involvemnt.

"It was neither an opinion nor a supposition. It is not what sex 'ought' to be, but rather what it is.  Sex is an activity performed for the purpose of procreating the species.

Sex is an activity used for procreation.  Sex is an activity that releases tensions.  This is a non-comprehensive list of what sex is.  Marriage is a social contract.  Marriage is a means of supporting a family.  Marriage is a means of establishing or supporting a dynasty.  Marriage is the acquisition of property (the female).  Marriage is the dividing of resources and income.  Marriage is hoped to be a lifelong commitment.  Amongst other things.  Your choice of which of these premises to select, and base a ""logical"" conclusion upon is subjective. Your conclusion is erroneous anyway because marriage isn't only about procreation, and in fact only happenstance to procreation in a number of cases since procreation will occur out of wedlock.",1

"In today's society people discriminate against homosexuals all the time. In the classroom, at people's offices, in people's own families. Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.  You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights.   People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.  As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they  had to base their decision on facts . When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.  So now, tallblondebigotedguy,  what are your reasons ? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage? I swear that I am listening to your reasons now. Don't hide behind false pretenses of discrimination, or that people don't respect your views, because until you can give me your reasoning, all of that is irrelevant.",1

They were very loving families and the children felt that love very deeply...even when the questions came, as they always do. Most of the kids I kept track of wouldn't have traded their upbringing for one second because it taught them things about prejudice, acceptance, being different and being OK with that.

"You are making an assumption and then you act on your assumption by making an accusation.  Assumption: straight people think they are more than we are   Accusation: that's why they want a copyright on the word.  My philosophy is to try and verify my assumptions before acting on them. That usually goes a long way towards saving face later on if the assumption proves to be wrong.  Your argument is also based on emotion and it thus tries to manipulate the reader's feelings. This is done by calling one group bad; the straight people. You do do this by saying that ""straight people think they are more than we are."" You then call the other group good; the gay people. You do this by saying ""We wish it to mean exactly what the word 'Marriage' connotes and carries with it.""  I prefer arguments that are based on data and let the reader decide. There is no way to prove that gays wish marriage to mean exactly what it connotes and carries with it. There is also no way to prove that straight people think they are more than gays.

"there are several good reasons for expanding the definition of marriage to include gay marriage -- reasons like fairness, liberty, and equality   Gay people are currently free to do anything they want, so in terms of fairness, liberty and equality, gay people are not disadvantaged at all.   .   You can just tell your kids, ""Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children.""   I'd rather not have to stray from the legal definition. Kids are always accusing parents of saying something and then do something else. This will add to that problem.  .  I'm not advocating that we stop gay unions. How can we? It's love right? You can't stop love!

"This is EXACTLY where you are wrong.   No i am not wrong. lol. Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)  In one sense, belief is knowledge if it is knowledge. If i hadn't have any clue about the earth's revolution around the sun and stated ""i believe the earth revolved around the sun"" and found out later is was knowledge, then belief is knowledge.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true. Knowledge is truth.    You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Too many people to carry. Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.    Contrary to your warped belief, it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   Im not whining. Your question was irrevalent. Why? Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.    First, that is not what you have said. Second, prove that it is ""mostly female homosexuals""? Finally, so what if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter all three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   Yes, that is what is stated. I stated "" If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that..."" What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals? Prove that how i stated that??? Because if not, that is another irrevelant question. So what if it is mostly female homosexuals...because i stated so. It is a scenario. I created it.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.    Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.    Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size. When i say population, i simply mean people. Take the people out the equation, do you have a society still? Without no eskimos, there is no society. And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture. Cool.     Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   ""Grow"" as in succeeding.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    Which is contradictory to what you have said.   In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.    I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.   You really didn't disprove my scenarios as proof that homosexuality helps societies and does not help societies.   In ways they do help, and in way they don't. Im not saying that homosexuals are completely helping socities or not completely helping societies.",0

Moreover, what is true today of your judgment may not be necessarily true in fact.

Some teenagers get pregnant, find out they're gay or something else, that don't 'fit in' the church.  And thats aweful. When christians do that, I wonder if there is any difference between islam and christianity after all. You know christians are going around and telling people how good and kind they are?

You're assuming to know  ""the real reason""  why some heterosexuals don't want to allow homosexuals to use the word marriage. Heterosexuals say that the reason they don't want gays to marry is because marriage has traditionally been a union between a man and a woman. You seem to be calling these heterosexuals liars and racists who consider gays to be subhuman.

The only way to ensure the right of homosexuals to marry would be to get an amendment passed. This would be virtually impossible though because there is still a lot of homophobia in the U.S. Also Church's, like the Mormon Church, encouraged their members to donate money and vote for Prop 8.   Honestly right now, religion is the biggest deterrent in this whole process. The only legitimate reasons against gay marriage are religious ones (i.e. sanctity of marriage) and of course this is a secular nation, so therefore they shouldn't sway people.

With that said, I didn't grow up in an orphanage, so it is tough to be entirely sure on a position without some doubt...",0
I do not understand the rationale behind someone wanting a title that comes from a religion that doesn't agree with your behavior. I'm not stating my opinion. Marriage comes from the bible. No two ways around that. Yes I know people were together before the bible but the marriage and the ceremonies come from the bible. Why is the life partner or any other legal term that allows a homosexual couple to have all the same rights as a heterosexual couple not enough. If you are wondering my opinion yes I believe homosexuality is wrong but I believe alot of things are wrong and people don't have to have a stigma for doing those things. I just don't get the argument.??,1
"Why from a different angle? Why cant you answer my question the way it is?   My answer to you is no, I can't prove to you that my religion is true, but I can tell you that I know that it is. Its not so much about what's true or not, but about how you live your life and the choices you make.",0
Who says your definition of family is correct? You think that two people who love each other should not be able to adopt merely because they are the same sex? How about single people who adopt?  Family  is  very important. Explain to me why homosexual parents are any less capable then heterosexual parents at raising a child.,1
"""Evidence? Considering how marraige predates any recordable history I don't see how you can come to such a conclusion.""  Sorry what? What is it you want evidence for? I'm merely pointing out that the world religions of today did not invent marriage.   I like how you have completely ignored important details, including the main point I was making.  Are you seriously telling me that you agree with those punishments, simply because it was a different time? You think people need death threats in order to not do serious crimes? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for executing murderers for example, but people that swear at their parents? People that don't scream loudly enough while being raped? Do you agree with this? Will you not concede that there are things in the bible that are wrong? Do you refute even the things said that have been proven to be false? Are you so commuted to the defence of a book that you have never read that you will try to harm other human beings because of things you have picked up from others?  It's clear to me from your last post that you have never studied the bible. The promise of eternal happiness is apparently not enough to encourage you to read a book. I would suggest looking up Jesus's actions before you make assumptions about his life. What is it exactly that you want me to take into account? Be specific. Actually do some research and tell me what you want me to consider. If you don't, then I will continue to base my opinion on Jesus from my own research, and believe me, he does not paint a pretty picture.  I have started to get the impression that you are an idiot. If your next response does not contain at least one intelligent sentence I won't bother replying. I am almost certain this will be the case, so enjoy living your ignorant life.",1

For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.   And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.   And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

"As far as your ""separate is not equal"" statement, it simply does not apply to this situation.   That statement applied to the situation between blacks and whites. One example (for illustrations purposes) is schooling. The idea was that blacks would have their own schools and whites would have their own school. But since at that time whites were more affluent than blacks, their children were able to enjoy a higher level of education.  In the current situation heterosexual couples are not necessarily more affluent than gays. There's no reason to assume that a heterosexual union would be better than a homosexual union. There's also no reason to assume that by calling a homosexual union a ""marriage"" that they will receive a ""higher level"" of benefits than if they just called it a civil union. Therefore, the statement ""separate but equal"" does not apply.",1

"The idea that human affairs of importance can be simply based on emotional subjective feelings is the rock on which it founders.Humanity has advanced according to the understanding he has of the laws which govern everything around us ,from the turning of the planets, the cells in our bodies, the plants on the earth.We have learned to understood and use the laws of flight, of engineering etc to bring about advancements in our society.Everything is underpinned by laws and although many people quote the bible they would be better to quote the laws of god as seen in science.When we seriously break these laws we descend.Most of us 'sin by breaking laws which allow us to live and exist and evolve in the universe .At this time the decisions we make will decide if we survive or not as a society into the future .There are narcissistic and sometomes deliberately malign people who hate that they cannot control these laws in a personal way  and they are determined to undermine that which they cannot control. Marriage or the recognition of the law of energy creativity inherent in the polar opposites of male female is neccessary as a force of good energy and must be encouraged .If we passed laws according to what people'felt'  and not what is creative and good we would be back in the cave .Since there is no benefit to society one has to ask why 'they' want to get married,perhaps to undermine what they 'hate'.After all if it is simply a social recognition a personal party etc is their free choice.

"No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I really don't care.    Yes you are. I repeat, ""I have never argued based on emotion."" Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   You are clearly lying. You stated that i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laughed. Therefore, you argued based off ""my""  emotion. You did stated that emotion isn't a logical argument. And i never said you argued off of your emotion. But you argued on my emotion; hence, you argued off of emotion.    But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   No. I said that knowledge isn't ""always"" discovered, it is created as well. Im not stating that there isn't never a difference between knowledge discovered and knowledge created. In some examples, there is a difference. In some examples, they are the same.    I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   lol i don't even know how my words ""beg the question."" I don't understand what you fully mean.    I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the need for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Sigh. How else can i justify my assumption without evidence? Justify means ""show or prove to be right or reasonable"" as stated by google. Evidence seems like the best way to justify in my perception.    Really?   Unless those straight guys are going to rape those homosexual ladies, i don't ever see those ladies ever producing children. And you know what rape leads to...mental problems. And that isn't good for a society.    No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I would have to disagree with you on that. Why is it never a good thing? In some perspectives, i see it as a good thing if that person isn't harming another soul.    If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart   Morality exists. In order to fully justify it, i have to do a experiment with millions of people.    These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Can we please not get into this. I know that i didn't intend to disrespect you because i am me. You have no say because you are not me.    That is not an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.   I know what you are stating. I know the view that you are looking at this from. However, you did argue off of emotion. If you want to be specific, you should had stated that you don't argue off of my emotion.

"If there is a conflict between the Constitution and a Federal law, it is the Constitution that presides over such cases where the conflict exists. In this case, where DOMA conflicts with the full faith and credit clause, it is the full faith and credit clause that reigns supreme.  In 1808, Justice Marshal in the Marbury v Madison case declared:  ""So, if a law [e.g., a statute or treaty] be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.""",0
I have actually never been given the ' birds and the bees ' speech from my mother or father. Even if a couple is homosexual they still know what the speech is I mean I have never heard it from my parents but I have heard it from other people and on TV.

Studies have already proven that a child from a homosexual couple turns out the same as a child from a heterosexual couple.,1

I don't see how expanding the definition of marriage is confusing at all. You can just tell your kids, ""Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children."" Do you seriously think they would have trouble grasping that?",1
"To say that two men or two women necessarily can't raise a child as well as a one-man-one-woman couple is sexist and inaccurate. We all know there are some heterosexual couples who are clearly unqualified to raise children. Restrictions on adoption should depend on the individual circumstances of the adopting family, not on generalised statements about the differing parenting styles of men and women.",1
"It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent. And this is exactly what is being done with marriage. The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences. Yes, I was using hyperbole to make a point. If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference? Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.  Just for the sake of humor:   consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   Me and my cat had a ritual; it actively walked up to the alter in my apartment were I was kneeling and meowed and I respond back with ""I love you too"" we rubbed noses and I said till death do we part. Then she meowed in response. So I guess we are married and the state needs to recognize it. :)",0

Christianity or religion does not own the term marriage. The type of marriage that homosexual couples are concerned about is legal marriage. They want all the benefits that heterosexual couples get.,1
"I would say raising children in such a fashion that we have a stable society has more to do with family finance, along with guidance and attention a child receives then whether or not the child is part of a nuclear family.   If your raised by one parent, and they bring home 80,000 a year by working just 4 hours a day(lets say their good with stocks), then lets say this person spends considerable time with their children; maybe he/she home schools them or something. That person would still be providing a good home, because the material, emotional and developmental needs of their children would be meet. If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, ""it takes a village to raise a child"".  Some homosexual couples adopt. gay marriage would allow for people to pool resources together better because of the financial incentives, meaning more stable families being more capable of adopting which would lessen the burden on foster care. There are many incentives to invest in homosexual marriage, i haven't came close to touching all of them here.",1
Too many kids in the foster care program are being ignored in some states because they wont let a gay couple take them in. Well how about we send that kid back to their messed up home! I'm sure they'd love it their too. I think in the rare cases that they live in a homophobic comunity they would rather deal with the ridicule of having gay parents then the ridicule of having bruises all over their face.,1
"Marriage must always be between consenting adults, because children are unable to give consent under the law; that is a seperate issue. This was understood in the previous argument when it was said that man + woman = marriage.  The point I was trying to make however is that all these stupid little formulas are meaningless, and the best definition of marriage would be one between two people regardless of gender. Age is a completely different argument, and not one that is relevent ot this particular debate.",1
"From my understanding, the Topic is Gay adoption and should the opportunity of adoption be extended to those in a homosexual relationship. Whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child. Also, the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child, during the raising and nurturing, from a male and a female. Can the same be done with two of the same sex? I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   Please refer to the 1st page of this book:  source:  http://books.google.com/ books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=NcmXvBX-- agC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PR3&dq;=adoption+law&ot s;=bMKbElPtsd&sig;=EGnN46PrECgKj75qw1ul uX0GcnM#PPA1,M1    You will find that adoption is considered: the creation of a parent-child relationship by judicial order between two parties who usually are unrelated.",1

"I disagree. And I'm actually picking your argument to comment on because it made more sense than most of the others on here. Although you are right in saying each parent gives certain lessons to a child and it's important that that child has different influences, these lessons do not have to come from people of the same gender. Different parents are going to be different no matter their gender. Nurturing doesn't necessarily come from the mother and discipline from the father. Also, say the parents are both men, the children aren't going to be secluded from women in their life. They will have aunts, grandmothers, teachers, family friends, etc that can serve as role models and examples. Also, regardless of whether your arguments make sense or not, it simply isn't shown in any studies done on children raised by gay parents",1

If honestly you can't let two people love one another then what gives YOU the right to even love someone?!  I don't want to hear the ""Well it says in the bible!...""

If that's all you can do with your life is tell someone they don't have the right to love then it is you that will judged by god himself and if you don't believe in god.

"Except there is no such thing as a ""separation of church and state,"" so your entire argument is moot.

My point, though, is that ""separation of church and state"" is nowhere in any of our founding documents. Nowhere. It is a myth. When the Constitution was ratified, many states had their own established religions and NONE of the Founders had any problem with this. They approved of established state religions! The First Amendment merely says that CONGRESS cannot establish any religion. Congress deals with federal laws, not state laws. So it is the federal government that cannot establish a nationwide religion. States, however, can. The Tenth Amendment says that anything NOT talked about elsewhere in the Constitution is up to the states. This means gay marriage, for one thing. Meaning that a federal BAN on gay marriage is unconstitutional; but so is a federal law ALLOWING gay marriage. Gay marriage is not in the Constitution, so it is up to each individual state to decide.  I do find it interesting, though, that you're a Christian and yet you support something that the founder of your religion did not support. Jesus'd be proud.",0
