"That point of view is very scary. You think the government should be able to control your personal life even when your minding your own business and hurting no one. And yet also allow big corporations to push substances more deadly than marijuana on consumers (Alcohol, Tobacco, Prescription Drugs).   Legalization is about the fact that a person should have the right to privacy and the choice to live their lives how they see fit as long as they hurt no one else. Consider the fact that prescription drugs have become the number one killer in these recent years. People are going to get high off what is available; why restrict them to things that are more dangerous. And why criminalize people who choose to use natural herbs instead of stuff created in laboratories.  Last I checked America was a country of liberty and freedom; but I guess that doesn't mean the same thing in this last century. The founding fathers didn't want to have some central government dictating the citizen's daily lives. It is supposed to be a government by the people and for the people. And most importantly under the law of the constitution. People don't want anything they don't deserve; they only want the one thing supposedly guaranteed in this country; Freedom.  Now if you think its mindless self indulgence to want freedom than you must be a fascist or a communist or maybe just confused and controlled; regardless I pity you.",1

"If we legalize marijuana, it will make our economy worse than it is. With the adults that now think it'll be okay to do it, they will possibly become addicted. With that addiction, they will spend money they don't have on it. Then they won't be able to pay bills, get groceries, or do everyday things. This is just a thought, it's not my full opinion, but this is flowing through my mind. Part of me is saying yes, yet, the other part is saying no. It's a split decision for me.",0

Although people may not be able to remember things as well while high, I do not believe there has been any study done to see if there is actually a correlation between marijuana use and memory loss. If I am wrong then please post the study. (Also do you think that a little memory loss warrants prohibition?)",1

"Yeah it's exactly like driving a tank down the street while you are drunk and there are kids around you. Except for the fact that it doesn't harm yourself or anyone else. Instead of using inane analogies, how about you tell me specifically how marijuana is dangerous and I will explain to you why you are wrong. If you want to be taken seriously in a debate, don't say abstract and ridiculous things like marijuana is a weapon and like a bullet. If marijuana is so dangerous as you seem to think it is tell me how.",1
I'm your personal reference and no matter who studies it it doesn't get any better or worse by having personal experience. It's what I KNOW and what I witnessed. The 70's have come and gone but that means nothing. Where do you get your pot from? Who broke it down? Who laced and cut it? Year in year out it's the same killswitch. I agree with your 2nd portion absolutely but not the 1st or 3rd. Did you not read the link I gave?.,0
"Yes. In comparison to those substances which we allow (alcohol and tobacco being the two most obvious) it is really no worse. It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept. And arguably the best point: we could stop using taxpayer money to crack down on dealers and instead tax pot sales via liscenced distributors. This is a particularly timely point given our government's deficit.",1
"Yes, there are no deaths related to the actual use for marijuana this past year or ever in terms of health reasons.",1
"The argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed. Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol.  Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves. That isn't even touching on the other benefits of legalisation, including freeing up space in the over-crowded prison system, providing an additional source of government income in the form of tax and freeing up police time to tackle violent crimes.",1
"All of these statements have been made by the United States government over the past years. If you can find rebuttals for them, I'd love to hear them, but until then, I believe them. If you accept that terrorist organizations are funded by the drug trade and that marijuana is a gateway drug, then the third statement logically follows. If more people can use pot, then more will move on to harder substances, which will fund the terrorist orgs.",1
I'd say so. [;,0
"First, you have done drugs yourself, because alcohol IS a drug. It's simply a legal one like tobacco. And as someone who has been around both and tried both and tried both in excess, it's my opinion that alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than marijuana.   Marijuana does inflict harm to the self, but that's where it ends. People don't get high and then get belligerent, angry, and violent. They don't get high and drive overconfidently at 90 mph. I'm not saying driving under the influence of marijuana is by any means safe, but in comparison to alcohol, it is a lot safer. When you're under the influence of alcohol, you become overconfident in your abilities and drive without the normal care and caution you would have. Your vision is also blurred and reaction times slowed. Under marijuana, again your reaction times are slowed, but unlike using alcohol, when you drive under the influence of marijuana you drive with more care and caution than normal. It's the positive effect of paranoia. Furthermore, you can overdose on alcohol and die from it, which is an impossibility with marijuana.   It's interesting that you bring up prohibition and then state that you're afraid it will cause problems because people will become ""addicted"" to it. Prohibition is an excellent example to bring up. What did history teach us about prohibition? That it doesn't work. People will always self medicate, and so long as the substances they are using are absent of any serious effects, they will continue using those substances.   In fact, legalization of marijuana may cut down on the ""gateway"" effect of the drug (though I don't buy the gateway argument in and of itself, but more on that later). Many people try marijuana after being taught by the government's propaganda what a terrible awful drug it is. Once they try it and learn the truth, that it's very similar to alcohol, with a few key differences, they begin to question the government's authority on other drugs as well. ""If they lied to me about marijuana, maybe cocaine's not all that bad either.""   On the other hand, let me say this to the gateway argument. Tobacco and alcohol are the number one and number two gateway drugs. So if we call marijuana a gateway, let us only do so after calling out the top two.   As far as medicinal marijuana goes, you've obviously either done little to no research on the topic or you lack compassion. You state that cancer patients use it to numb the pain of treatment and to make them hungry in order to counteract the effects of nausea from treatment. I ask, what is wrong with that? It seems that if people are going through a very painful and difficult treatment (that may not even succeed) they might be entitled to pain relief and some semblance of a normal life (i.e. being able to eat normally). Nobody claims that marijuana ""cures"" anything, it's pain medication, much like morphine, demerol, vicodin, etc. AND it's natural. No pharmaceutical company has mixed in chemical compounds to create it. I get terrible menstrual cycles, they've always been awful and have gotten worse as I've gotten a bit older. The only thing that successfully treats the pain and discomfort I feel during those first two days is, you guessed it, marijuana.   Prohibition has been tried...for seventy years. And rather than reduce marijuana use, now nearly half of the country admits to having tried the substance. We waste money on criminalization of marijuana and we create crime. If marijuana were available legally, drug dealers would be out of business, and users would no longer have to be jailed at your expense. The government would be able to tax the substance and make a pretty penny off of people's use of it as well.   There's no proof that use of marijuana would increase if prohibition ended. It would make us all safer and save us a ton of money. I'm sick of the hypocrisy of alcohol-users in regards to marijuana. If you want to oppose it, fine, but you sure as hell better oppose it's uglier, scarier brother, Alcohol, first.",1
"Laws aren't really doing anything to stop cannabis consumption, anyway. If you legalized, you could tax it too. Sure, legalize marijuana. But that's not the problem, is it?  But I am personally against recreational drug use. Why is life so boring that one requires external stimulants? Unless restricted live in a cell forever and the like, it's always possible go something with your life. Society didn't spend all those years on people, raising them, feeding them, just to waste resources.",0
"Actually, I've smoked marijuana before and I never wanted to do it again. Sure, that's just me but come on. Are you really telling me that people who don't do it NOW are going to do it if it's legalized? If someone wants to do it, they're going to do it whether or not it's legal (proof is everyone smoking pot today). Anyways, how many people do you know to smoke pot? From the sound of it, everyone must, because you're saying that EVERYONE will be hooked on the stuff if it becomes legalized. I don't think that many people (including the person or people that will, 'cure cancer') want to waste their time smoking it. This is strictly from my point of view, and I'm only pointing out that there is a vast majority of people who do not smoke now. What does that mean? There will be (HOPEFULLY!) a vast majority of people who don't smoke, if and when marijuana becomes legalized. Just because a lot of people drink doesn't mean everyone does. Just because a lot of people smoke cigarettes doesn't mean every person does. And just because a lot of people overeat certainly does not mean that everyone does. Consider athletes, for example. I'm not so sure that if it actually is legalized everything will be perfect, but then again nothing is, really. If one looks at alcohol there is still a giant reoccuring problem with drinking and driving. Despite educational tools used in schools, teens still do it; even adults do. There will always be people who think they are capable of doing something they are clearly not.",1
"""But the American public has come to understand the bad that can come of these drugs.""   Annual deaths in the US from tobacco: 435,000  Annual deaths in the US from alcohol: 85,000  Total recorded deaths due to marijuana: 0  I'm not so sure people understand the harm that comes from them.  I don't see how you can support prohibition of marijuana, but not alcohol and tobacco without realizing what a hypocrite you are. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse no matter what metric you use.   ""Just because pot may not be physically addicting, does not mean it is not mentally addicting, which is just as bad. It means your brain is hooked and can't function without it. ""   No you can still function without it, you are thinking about the addiction that comes from cigarettes which you support. Marijuana can be psychologically addictive. All that means is that if you really like the feeling of being high, you will want to do it again. This does not mean you are not able to not do it. Anything that you enjoy can be psychologically addictive (Sex, gambling, createdebate.com). Even if marijuana were addictive like cigarettes and alcohol, you cannot use this point to argue against legalization unless you support prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. As I said name something bad that it doesn't have in common with those two drugs.   ""They tend to forget that marijuana smoke is 6 times worse than cigarette smoke, when it comes to carbon monoxide and the toxicity of the smoke itself.""   You have one misleading and one incorrect fact there. Marijuana smoke has been shown to not cause cancer. Scientists hypothesized that it would cause cancer because it contains more harmful chemicals, but when they did actual studies on live animals, they found absolutely no link between marijuana and any form of cancer. This is just one study by UCLA I can get more if you desire them.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html   So while it may be true that it contains more harmful chemicals, for whatever reason it still doesn't cause cancer.   In reference to the toxicity of the smoke, you couldn't be more wrong. Scientists have not been able to induce death in an animal due to marijuana. It's LD50, or quantity that would be lethal to half the population, is so high, that we cannot even find it. It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana and consequently there has never been a recorded death due to it.   http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm   I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you say smoke causes ""little nicks"" in arteries. Please cite an article or study because what you are saying makes no sense.  The study you cited by the British Lung Foundation doesn't appear to have been published in a peer reviewed medical journal like the studies that show marijuana is not harmful. Here is why the study is misleading.  They start out with a very bold statement  ""Smoking pure cannabis is more harmful to lungs than tobacco, a health charity is warning.""  So you continue on reading to see how exactly they proved that.  First ""evidence"":  ""A study by the British Lung Foundation found that just three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes. ""  First of all it is very uncommon to smoke three joints a day. Secondly they were most likely comparing unfiltered joints and filtered joints which is really intellectually dishonest. They also don't talk about what type of damage they are referring to. Marijuana smoke does temporarily paralyze the cilia or small hairs in your air passageways which can temporarily increase the risk of colds and other upper respiratory tract infections(OH NO). The smoke does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Furthermore there are other ways to ingest marijuana, including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals, vaporizing which releases only the THC and no harmful chemicals, and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals.  Second ""evidence"":  ""Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco. ""  As I said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say. While it may contain more carcinogens, it doesn't cause cancer. Numerous studies have failed to find any link. Yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer. Think about it, if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke, or even bad all, why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer, but so many showing tobacco causes cancer. There is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone.   http://www.salem-news.com/articles/ january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                           As I said, they don't have any concrete evidence that it causes health problems. It is not enough to say it contains dangerous chemicals. Especially when numerous studies show the chemicals don't cause damage.  You still somehow manage to fail to name one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes with evidence. Every thing you named once again is present in alcohol or tobacco and most of them weren't true.  So once again I ask you to name a negative result of marijuana that isn't present in tobacco or alcohol. And don't give me, 'it's too late to make alcohol and tobacco illegal.' First of all it is never too late, that is a cop out. But regardless of the pragmatism of making them illegal, I'll bet you still don't think we should.",1
If you just look at what happened with the hippie movement you can see that its not a good idea.,0
"The war on drugs is as useless and money-consuming as the war on terror, simply because you will NEVER eliminate either of the two. There will always be drugs and there will always be terrorists.

They've been onto something for a long time now. :)",1
"""That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this.""   I completely disagree with this statement and it goes against any scientific proof. Studies have been done that prove if you take breaks and have more leisure time you are a much more effective worker. Now obviously if you are neglecting your responsibilities leisure is bad. But that in no way implies that you have to be always working.  In your next response you talk about how you morally think doing things that are unproductive or enjoyable are wrong. I have several problems with this. First off, honestly I'm not you and neither is anyone else why should we have to be held accountable to your unreasonable and arbitrary morals. Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy people are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect people to operate without leisure time.  If you are going to tell people whether they can or cannot use substances such as Cannabis; than at least have a better reason than your supposed morals that almost half the country disagrees with. You admit to being hypocritical about your no-leisure rule by being on the internet rather than doing something productive and who is to say that is all your hypocritical about. So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals.  But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through illegal channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a legal substance (Alcohol) in my spare time. Decriminalization is not enough. The game is over, we know that Cannabis is no worse and possibly better than Alcohol and denying people the right to a trustworthy and accountable Cannabis industry is authoritarian at best.",1
"People cannot sell themselves into slavery, people cannot give other people permission to murder them, people cannot give up their inalienable constitutional rights to due process...etc..etc. People don't have the right to take away their rights and freedoms; if someone is mutilating their body, attempting suicide, or engaging in obviously harmful activities our laws clearly indicate we have the right to detain and provide psychological treatment to them.   Noone left me in charge, I have an opinion. We are all imposing our beliefs about what is best for ourselves and each other when engaging in democratic activity so I don't see the problem with my objections to and sanctions of narcotics.   The difference between escaping through activity and escaping through chemical alteration is the difference between exercise and steroid injections. It is the difference between increasing your height through a proper diet while still in your development stages and breaking your legs and resetting them repeatedly.   Not only is the activity unnecessary, a cop-out, and usually not even a remedy for a real malady, but it is an extreme approach and ultimately detrimental to the person's body, mind, and their professional life.   What I am saying is that in the case of drugs people are willfully giving up their freedoms; I would like to have it given back. Besides, if they are already giving up their freedom and humanity for a little pleasure, why on earth should they have the rights in the first place? Would you give a teenager a car if they decided to wreck it, on purpose, every time just to experience the thrill?   People shouldn't be allowed to choose to be slaves just as much as people aren't allowed to be slave-owners. I find it frightening that people seem to actively look to be controlled, by addiction or dictators, and I don't want such behavior to go unchecked.   Video games are an absence of the use of freedom, chemical alterations remove them or block them. Chemicals destroy personality and individuality, pass-times merely divert them and slow their growth or actualization.   Again, Marijuana isn't a big deal in this respect; but legalizing it certainly doesn't help. It does dull the senses, it does have long-term psychological and intellectual effects, and it is possibly as if not more carcinogenic than Tobacco and just as addictive (not yet completely substantiated so I could be wrong).  Some basic facts on it can be found here; a rather well-rounded survey of Marijuana and its effects:   http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    From the site:  ""Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.""  ""A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia.""  Now, that, again, is not known to be 100% true. Marijuana research is still in its developing stages (probably due to its illegality) and so not enough is known to say anything with certainty.   I'd like to see more studies to make sure that it is as benign as many people like to think it is. If it turns out to be then I have even less of a problem with it. The hard drugs, however, should always be illegal in my eyes.",0
"Yea and you know this by experience? Last time I checked... when we ended prohibiton on alcohol, crime dropped drasticly... You dont know what your talking about",1
Although i am not a pot smoker I do believe that pot should be legalized for many reasons. For one pot was never a direct cause of death to anyone unlike tobacco and beer.

Also a lot of comedians like to take their ideas from pot too haha,1
Incorrect. Medical Marijuana can be prescribed for any number of things. Cancer patients are prescribed because it takes away the nausea that follow chemotherapy sessions which is extremely important to the recovery of the patient since if said patient can't eat from the chemo he'll stay weak and probably not survive.

It's your choice if you're going to do it or not.",1
"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",1

"The War on Drugs is not only a moral problem but a economic problem. First, it is morally wrong because the government restricts the free choice of individuals to participate in such substances, and the number of people people killed every year with selling or buying drugs is simply unnecessary and unjust. When someone engages in the use of drugs, it is the decision of that person and they are only hurting themselves nor the government.  Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well. The government would have 10 billion dollars to spend elsewhere. It would eliminate drug cartels. Not only is the enforcement costly, but by criminalizing these people, taxpayers have to pay for them in live in prisons throughout America.  The only negative aspect is that it may lead to a increase in drug addicts.",1

"In reality   Or whatever passes for reality in your mind.   Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol   Can you provide any evidence? You see, I can provide a lot to indicate otherwise. Alcohol kills, according to NORML, around 85,000 people a year! Tobacco kills 435,000 people each year! Then we come down to good ol' Mary Jane, and she isn't responsible for a single death.   Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug   Marijuana has been proven to not be a gateway drug.   into crack cocaine, heroin    Nope    opium   WHO THE HELL DOES OPIUM ANY MORE?!?   It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed.    Depends on the user. I've known people who smoked until they greened out, but others only take a toke or two to relax.   When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional.    This is based purely on personal observation, but I'd say that one is more functional when high, but functional in a different manner.   Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed   Yet it still is more damaging to the body than weed!   Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco   Depends on how much you smoke. All day every day, probably; but most people aren't like that.   however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does   You hear about drunk driving all the time, but I've never heard of a case where the only intoxicant involved was ganja.   Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain.   Willing to provide evidence for this?   Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected.   As somebody who actually smokes pot occasionally, I disagree with this.   With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run.   That just sounds plain ridiculous!   Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues   Slow down?! Cheeba saves lives!   it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue.   Depends on the issue, I should imagine. It helps people going through chemo to eat, which is pretty damn useful if you want to, you know, LIVE.   Same goes with prescription medicine.   Compare the negative side effects of, say, just about any prescription medicine with the negative side effects of sensimilla. I dare you.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because politicians, doctors, and those involved with Big Pharma make shitloads of money from their legality.   I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case   Fortunately. Herb should be used because of its benefits to all, not just the sick.   Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults.   As well as many adults. Most people, once again in my experience, do not abuse it. Most people use it recreationally, and it does less harm than good.   There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill.   Too many trillions wasted on finding and incarcerating those non-violent users of drugs?   The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.    Mull use is goin' down!",1

"Ok, let me educate you peple, and set the facts straight on Cannabis.  1st, Cannabis is probably the safest drug known to man, we have a endocannabinoid system designed to handle the substance. -  http://www.briancbennett.com/charts/death/cannabis.htm   2nd, medically speaking it is one of the safest and most effective medications for the widest variety diseases known. -  http://scientificfactsofpot.com/studies.htm   3rd, more people die from the war on drugs than they die from the pot itself, i need no citation here if you believe that this plant has killed more than the cartels, (a result of this underground black market that formed to fill the demand for cannabis) and this war on drugs has, then then you're beyond help.  4th, the government understands that there are no negative effects of pot use, otherwise they'd be all over it parading the facts on their asinine antidrug commercials.  5th, as far as the commercials go they're run by the NIDA (national institute on drug abuse) which is able to run such a heavy ad campaign because of contributions from the alcohol and tobacco industry.. -  http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/obstruction.htm   6th, In a recent study it was shown that cannabis actually DISCOURAGES harder drug use. - (simple version)  http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/medicalmj08.htm#note1   - (for the scientifically inclined)  http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/4/1/16   7th, cannabis prohibition was created as a way to arrest jazz musicians and mexican immigrants taking american jobs - even the history channel knows this, just look at their doc on it  8th, we're alienating our kids and workers, creating a network of fear through these ineffective drug tests -  http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/drugtest.htm   9th, the tax revenue from legalization is estimated to be in the billions -  http://economics.about.com/od/incometaxestaxcuts/a/legalize_pot.htm   10th, through legalization we'd be restoring the fundamental RIGHT of people to do as they please with their bodies. The government has no say in what someone should do with their body as long as it's not infringing on anyone else's rights.  as far as driving high goes -  http://www.break.com/usercontent/2007/7/                                        Dr...igh-339007.html",1

"Marijuana, like tobacco, causes cancer as it contains carcinogens.    In the quest to investigate the link between cancer and marijuana, research can be roughly divided into two categories: lab research and investigation of long term users outside of the lab. Yes, as an unfortunate amount of lab animal deaths can attest, cannabis does contain carcinogenic molecules. However, research involving actual users paints a rather different picture.    http://scienceblog.com/10660/ study-finds-no-link-between-marijuana- use-and-lung-cancer/     http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/ story/2012-01-10/ Marijuana-doesnt-harm-lung-function- study-says/52483604/1    There is some controversy regarding the efficacy of these findings. Because marijuana is illegal, it is difficult to find users to participate in these studies, particularly finding heavy long-term users. It has been argued that if it were legalized, it would be much easier to find participants from a wider range of the population, and the information gathered could prove to be more accurate. Still, working with what we've got, it appears that marijuana use not only does not have anywhere near the effect that cigarette smoking does in terms of carcinogenic properties, it even seems to lower rates of certain types of cancer.    Marijuana is also highly addictive.   Not  highly . It is significantly less addicting than tobacco or alcohol, about on the same level as caffeine, but usually with less severe withdrawal symptoms. Pretty much anything that stimulates the reward centers of the brain will have some addictive qualities among a large enough sampling of users. But marijuana is very low on the totem pole compared to many legal and even non-regulated substances.    http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ the-teenage-mind/201012/ is-marijuana-addictive     http://health.ezinemark.com/ the-addictiveness-of-marijuana-or- cannabis-31e84cc7129.html     Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine.    Studies have also shown that most marijuana users drank alcohol before smoking pot. But alcohol is not considered a gateway drug. Why? Lower incidence of illegal drug use. But lets think about this for a second. As long as marijuana is illegal the people who use it can be classified as ""people who are willing to break at least one law."" Among adults, alcohol drinkers aren't classified that way. Some might be willing to, and those who are may end up using illegal drugs. Others will be totally law abiding, and since that is the majority of them, alcohol does not get considered a gateway drug. The only way to fairly compare the two would be to put them on the same legal standing and do studies at that point. Further, people who buy marijuana illegally have a greater exposure to other illegal drugs than those who don't since many dealers deal in multiple drugs. I suspect that the legal status of marijuana plays more of a role in its status as a gateway drug than any actual medical reason.    If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence.    The War On Drugs is at least partially to blame here. First, the strategy behind the WOD is to increase the cost. But since most drugs, marijuana included, are highly elastic commodities, this doesn't much reduce the demand. Instead it makes for wealthier drug lords, and competition between them leads to violence. The harder we crack down, the worse the situation gets. Also, we would make it less profitable for the drug lords by opening a legal channel of distribution and cultivation. Having marijuana as a legitimate source of retail would seriously reduce the number of people obtaining it illegally. It could also be regulated for quality and purity this way, which is currently not possible.",1
"Agree completely, the way the law is it has ruined so many peoples lives with jail time and criminal records with overly harsh and excessive mandatory sentences. Its just insane. It doesn't really hurt anyone, alcohol is far worse, yet when people tried to stop that with prohibition, it didn't work at all. It seems we haven't learned our lesson from our own recent history. So sad and tragic, because it was completely preventable. Be wise Legalize.",1
"I don't think that it should be legalized but at the same time I think that it should be decriminalized.    The drug, or all drugs for that matter, have an effect on society. It's not just about the individuals safety. We already have tobacco and alcohol, if we make either illegal there will be a riot, jobs will be lost and so on. If we add another drug to the legal market, that's just another way to waste time.    People in this country act like everyone owes them something, like their 8 hour shift at work is all that is expected of them and that's all that they have to do. Anything more is a waste of their time because they could be spending it doing something that they want to do. Sure, that's the American dream. Work, go home and plan your next vacation, maybe sit back and relax with a beer. Watch television and talk about the ""good ol times"" with your buddy... That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this (I'm using cognitive processes to contribute to an idea that other people can read, appreciate, or better, disagree with, so technically neither you nor I are really wasting time, but you and I could be doing better).

And you don't build up tolerance and NEED something.

"The only health danger is the tar, which can be practically eliminated with vaporizers; legalization would open up a larger market for vaporizers, increasing demand, increasing competition and bringing prices down so that the market expands even more. Also as part of the condition for legalization the government can provide tax breaks and such for such companies, to decrease the only serious health risk and to improve the economy.   If the purpose of a law is to give as much freedom to people without allowing those people to neglect or abuse others rights, then what right is being threatened by marijuana usage? So called ""hard drugs"" can lead to many social issues and can actually be directly correlated, and scientifically shown to be part of the cause of right violations.

And as far as it goes for medicinal purposes, marijuana does not cure anything in which many people try and use that excuse because they think it does.

If you want to talk about gateway drugs, let's talk about alcohol and tobacco, the two legal, harmful drugs that lead people to try other ones.   ""There are many people who don't smoke pot because it is illegal""--This is an argument for the efficacy of prohibition, which, if we're being honest, is fairly ineffective. I could just as easily argue there are many people who smoke pot in spite of it being illegal. Does either argument address whether or not it ought to be legalized? No.   Marijuana has no business being illegal when it is less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is not only legal but used by a large portion of the population. Alcohol poisoning kills people every year, as does drunk driving. Marijuana cannot be overdosed on, nor does it make people over-confident or belligerent.   The latest marijuana ads have been more accurate than in years past. ""We didn't shoot anybody. We just sat on Pete's couch"".

Jane can be considered a gateway drug and in a lot of cases jane is a lot less harmful that alcohol is to our bodies.

I know students that are in the top of my sophomore class that smoke pot regularly and are within top 20 out of a 600 student class.

"The answer to the question, does marijuana effect the brain? Marijuana does not effect the brain in damage, but it can alter in functions. Marijuana effects the perception of time, distance, and speed. It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ""Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness."" So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, ""depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy."" 123helpme.com  This make you want to smoke mary? :) cus it certainly doesnt apeal to me.",0
"""If you want to smoke weed, don't make the argument for decriminalization.""  -WHAT? WHY? Any step towards legal weed is a good one.  Both decriminalization and legalization both have many numbers that show it's beneficial effects on society. Oh, and if you didn't notice, legalization DOES decriminalize it. They are not mutually exclusive.  And yes, many people want to get high on cannabis. That's why we're here. If you can come up with a good reason why that should be illegal, I'm all ears. So far, I haven't heard anything. People using drugs is not bad, we do it all the time (caffeine, Tylenol, Vicoden). People using dangerous drugs is bad. If you can prove that pot is dangerous to society, I'm all ears. No one has been able to do so. Ever.",1

"Popular sovreignity is the cornerstone of democracy. Purely on the grounds of this, the overwhelming public support for the legalisation of marijuana, should it be legalised. A question of legality should be totally devoid of any of the the potential benefits or problems since our political system is not based upon paternal justifications.  This aside, the overwhelming benefits to society is enough even for a clearly paternal government to legalise. Even though these have already been stated, I will reiterate: the economic savings of such legalisation alongside the proven fall in consumption (note statistics from Portugal's decriminalisation) provides a clear justification if this government did have our best interests at heart.",1
i think it would be a perfect thing for the Gov't if legel. Pot heads would still buy it for any price and it would help lower our debt. But if it were leaglized it would need to be controlled and stuff. its still dangroud and adictive like beer and cigrattes,1

And this wouldn't stop drug lords, do they not have cigarettes on the black market at dirt cheap prices? Wouldn't you buy from someone growing themselves at a cheaper price to avoid a tax? How does that stimulate a business let alone the whole economy?  4. The last thing we need is more people doing it. More people making it a problem for themselves, more people ending up in rehab at the governments expense. In fact I hate being around people doing it.

I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Well, the principal you are trying to demonstrate doesn't help your argument, when other invalid conclusions can be drawn from the same line of reasoning.   ""According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old."" -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   I would really like to know what this article defines as ""dependency"" because I happen to know that marijuana does not produce withdraw when it's use is ceased.  In the broad sense almost anything can be addicting, or abused. I could abuse Tylenol, but that does not mean it is inherently addictive. So please define your terms here.   Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.",1

I do know that the greatest innovators have almost all been drug users.   I couldn't tell you whether abstainers are holding themselves back, I'm not fucking psychic. Drugs have different effects on everyone. If I had to guess, I would say yes, they probably would be a tiny bit more creative if they tried certain drugs. Note that this belief is  not mutually exclusive  with the idea that drugs aren't needed to be creative.

"marijuance creates LACK of concentration, not an increase of concentration!   Marijuana is addicting, no matter what you say. If made legal, it will become a competitive market just like any other thing. (At least for those who don't grow it). That would mean there would still be [illegal] sellers, as they would be breeding more powerful strains to get more powerful amount of THC levels.   The more powerful it is the more addicting. Substance abuse is a health problem. We already have a huge health-care industry centered around alcohol/drug abuse. You want to add to the list?   The Tobacco Companies wait in anticipation so they can start packaging and selling to more idiots. That's right--I'm talking marijuana. No doubt they pay for studies to try to prove that marijuana is ""harmless"". They see big dollar signs, just like with tobacco.  The FDA would have to get involved to ""put a limit"" on ""acceptable"" drug levels. They would also have to enforce these rules, And just like with alcohol, they have to watch for ""bootleg"" sellers who try to sell dangerous products.

Prohibiting drugs also makes it ""forbidden fruit"" and taboo, which is a big reason a high number of teenagers and young adults use drugs.  Doing drugs is a victimless crime and it should be a person's choice what they put in their own body, not the government's choice.",1

"Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary ""Should I smoke Pot?"" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a ""druggy"" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.",1

After all that wonderful thinking I came to the conclusion that weed should not be legalized because of the abuse factor and not for any other reason. If I was still out there partying like I did years ago, I'd probably enjoy a few tokes for a nice buzz and although marijuana itself does NOT lead to other drugs, in the wrong hands a person with an addictive mindset/personality WILL go past the joint or two over the week-end. Pot laced with what have you will send you reeling and there is plenty of stuff out there to lace it with.

And if it was legalised you could guarantee it would be lower in THC. If you want to smoke legally, go for a trip to Amsterdam. I'm sure there are alot of positive aspects such as taking it of the black market and taxing it (monetarily) and do agree on most grounds, but if you take a look at the outcome in the long run, I don't feel its a good idea. It may free up the courts from drug busts, but it would fill the courts in people selling to the underaged,as with cigarettes and alcohol, people suing over cancer claims, insurance problems, and the list goes on.

By contrast, 51.9 percent of Americans age 12 and older (or roughly 100 million people) had used alcohol at least once in the 30 days prior to being surveyed in America.

"Effectiveness of the War On Drugs:  ""Police arrested an estimated 872,720 persons for cannabis violations in 2007, the highest annual total ever recorded in the United States, according to statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Of those charged with cannabis violations, approximately 89 percent, 775,137 Americans were charged with possession only. An American is now arrested for violating cannabis laws every 38 seconds. ""  -Obviously, from this you can see that it's completely failing: the American people want to smoke pot and there's nothing that can be done about it.  Cost:  ""Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 43,266 inmates per year. About 25 per cent are sentenced for drug law violations. "" -Many of these people's lives were completely ruined by incarceration.  ""The U.S. federal government spent over $19 billion dollars in 2003 on the War on Drugs, at a rate of about $600 per second. The budget has since been increased by over a billion dollars. "" - All these tax dollars spent in attempt to prevent something that's never going away and millions of hard working American citizens enjoy.  So the war on drugs is completely un-effective and also extremely costly in terms of human life, happiness, and finances. All quotes taken from  http://www.drugsense.org/wodclock.htm  which has further references.  Also, read the government's findings on marijuana here:  http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    Keep in mind most of everything that is said in this report uses words such as ""may"" and ""could"" because nothing, as of now, is conclusive. This is in spite of the fact that we as humans have been using it for thousands of years. My feeling on this is that if marijuana actually is dangerous....then not only would we know it from hearing about it, but these studies would have conclusive, definitive results. Not wishy-washy, half-assed results. Also: you won't find anything in that report that is worse than existing legal substances and pharmacueticals (think vicoden, lithium, valuum, morphein, wel butron, etc.).  So...what the hell? Why are we having a war on pot?   Results of ending the war on drugs: no more tax money being spent, millions of Americans' lives will be instantly better as they will not be incarcerated, etc. A new industry will be created that will provide tax revenue, jobs, etc. A small number (comparatively) of government workers would lose their jobs.  Results of not ending the war on drugs: DEA agents, etc. and others will not lose their jobs. Politicians will continue to have something to be proud of and market themselves with. People will continue to use drugs anyway, as history has shown and nothing will change as it is now and has been since it was made illegal.  An alternative to the war on drugs? We need to shift our thinking from drug addict, CRIMINALS to drug addict, PATIENTS. Meaning these people need help, not jail. There's a reason they are taking the drug - lets solve the problem with using therapy, clinics, raising awareness, and educating people so that they can make their own healthy decisions. No one is saying there isn't a problem, but there are many that say (and I agree) that we're going about this problem all wrong.",1

"LEGALIZING =/= DECRIMINALIZATION    If you want to smoke weed, don't make the argument for decriminalization. Legalization and decriminalization are two different subjects.

"societys prohibition in 1937, extract of Cannabis sativa (marijuana) was one of the top three most prescribed medicines in the US. When it became illegal, its use as a medicine became restricted. Despite these regulations research on the medical use of marijuana continued. I have read this article it's so interesting there are many thing why cannabis shouldn't be legalize  http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/ addiction/issues/marijuana.html     One thing I learned is that marijuana does relieve pain and that it is not nearly as addictive as morphine. It can ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and, at the same time, give you a wonderful high.  Despite the positives, I am not convinced. There are so many other factors that need to be considered. Marijuana causes some parts of the brain - such as those governing the emotions, memory and judgment - to spin out of control.If you choose to ignore the attacks and memory loss, consider what marijuana can do to your lungs. Its smoke carries more tar and other particles than tobacco. You can relieve your migraine, but you also have a higher chance of developing lung cancer.To drug policy reformers, prohibition of marijuana is not just a cause to be supported, but a mandatory way of life, necessary to uphold society’s moral fiber. These activists do not consider marijuana to be safe. Even when scientific information supports the lack of harmful effects of cannabis on the body; many still categorize it with dangerous substances such as cocaine or heroine. I'm against",0
"I cant believe I am saying ""legalize"", cause every time the pothead in the flat below mine starts smoking it, the whole block of flats starts stinking of skunk.  Part of me thinks that it should remain illegal so people can call the police and arrest the inconsiderate idiot... but after a bit of thought, I have changed my mind.  If it was legalized, then pot would probably be of better quality, and closely monitored for its ingredients.   If it was legalized, and you could only get it from your doctor, then it would be easy to detect addiction and the doctor could refuse to give you any.   If it was legalized, then there would be no dodgy characters entering my block of flats to sell not only pot but the whole array of harder drugs.  If it was legalized, some of the money that pothead is paying could be used to benefit the rest of us in taxes, and not only a small group of criminal barons.   But, alas, it is illegal... so now I have to put up with skunk smell and shadows creeping in the night to sell it.",1
"Marijuana should definitely be legalized. Tobacco is much more harmful to the human body yet the government bows down to the needs of ""Big Tobacco"". The government spends so much money on the ""War on Drugs"" and yet doesn't realize if they just legalized marijuana they could start taxing it and collecting a ton of money that could be put to better purposes, such as fixing health care or Social Security.",1
"It employs people. But it also takes countless other people sitting at a desk, an incarceration system, a trial, and payment for all of the law enforcements equipment. The flagrant waste of tax dollars outweighs a handful of jobs. A handful of jobs paid for by YOU so you can be slammed against the hood of a car for a victimless crime.  And legalizing may spring the use forward a bit, however during the Prohibition era of America, the restriction of alcohol brought innumerable amounts of new people to drink regardless, and its inevitable sale was instead left to booming gangs. Don't tell me restriction is an effective/ethical practice",1
"Good things if we legalized it (in the U.S.):  If it was legal the government could regulate it and it could be dispensed safely. This would stop people from dying when their drugs have been modified in an unhealthy way. Second, we could tax the heck out of it. It's not the best solution, but it would help curb the government's budget problems. What about Industrial Hemp? That would help create a billion dollar industry, hence more jobs, and more money if the US exports and or imports it to different countries.  Hemp is good for as a alternative fuel, food, clothing, paper, etc. That would help our environment greatly. Why cut down trees that takes over 80 years to fully grow while you can use hemp that fully grows per season?What about the waste of tax payers money called the war on drugs? It's a completely useless program that helps create more chaos by making drug cartels being stinking rich, do you really want the drug cartels to have such power?  Bad things:  Marijuana is proven to cause depression and change brain patterns in odd ways among other things. But there are many worse drugs. However if Marijuana was legalized there would be a push to legalize other drugs. Things like Meth and Estacy could be legalized, then we could say goodbye to civilization as we know it. Even if other drugs werent legalized after, Marijuana its still a gateway to a high feeling. And many, too many, will want to move on to larger highs, to drugs which have undoubtedly negative effects, to drugs which will annihilate your ability to think and function.   So, in the end, my thoughts are not to legalize it, but to decriminalize it. It could be decriminalized for say, a personal amount. If you're caught over that amount you receive a fine. Charging and convicting people for personal amounts is a waste of tax money and court time. Nobody has ever died directly related to marijuana. Nor does is it cause much society problems unlike alcohol and hard drugs.",1

"What is truly pitiful is that one could find pity and fear in what you do not know. I use your post as supporting evidence.    Now, if you're realistically thinking about this issue, and not in Imagination Land, you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity. I am a citizen of these United States of America, and I know what that means.   I personally have no concern about the drug itself and I am fully aware that cigarettes and alcohol are more dangerous, but legal.   When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine for the few drugs on the market that marijuana could (realistically) replace. Also, I actually advocate the use of hemp and wish America would get with the program, I know the benefits of hemp cloths and hemp oils.   What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.    If you look at society as a whole, we already have a few cancers at work. Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug. Cigarettes, for the economy are bad, because those who smoke are hopelessly addicted and will spend money on cigarettes before spending it on things that they should buy, like food or clothes. Do we really, at this point need another? For people who don't drink, and for people who don't smoke cigarettes?   Like I said, think about it realistically. What is government for? Why is a government needed at all, I mean, what is the main single duty of a government???  It is to secure domestic peace , before anything else, that is what a government does. The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace. If someone steps out of line, because they have agreed to live under this government, are held to the same rules as the next. No one steps out of line, and we have a perfectly paired society to it's government. Unfortunately we, as humans, cannot have this.    So if the government only really exists to secure domestic peace, yet we already have a number of drugs out there, why should we have another to complicate things with.    Also, you have to imagine that weed is legal. No more will people feel the need to be home when stoned. They might as well get stoned in public. Like drinking, especially if it were made illegal, people would take their beer home with them, and drink there, most people  do , stay home and drink. If it were illegal, you wouldn't see drunk people as much now would you? I highly doubt you would.    Marijuana, I logically think, would be more addicting than tobacco and alcohol combined if it were made legal and then integrated into popular culture, as tobacco is. You get more for less, with less consequences... what a dream, right? I mean, if I am opposed to the legalization, yet I would still do it if it were, doesn't that mean something???   It's something that I don't want to deal with, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on this. If it were legalized, it would only get worse.    That's really all I can say for now, and sorry if it wasn't enough to satisfy your lack of understanding.    I would like to advise you that ad hominen arguments are not welcome here.      You are on a website that allows you to share ideas and opinions. Do not attack people for their opinions because, if you think that denying the legalization of marijuana is not American, you are doing the greater evil by suppressing the voices of the citizens that this democracy represents by using childish and petty insults.",0
I know so many successful people that have smoked or still smoke pot on occasion and have never used anything else. If you look at the history on how it got classified as a hardcore substance it all politically motivated and a bunch of BS.

I'm tired of hearing about nice people who are doing 10 years to life just for weed.

"First of all, making blanket statements about an entire group of people (that includes our President) makes YOU an idiot. Secondly, if it were completely legal, priced and taxed similar to tobacco (which is HEAVILY taxed), it would be a drop in the bucket. I would love to pay for pot what tobacco smokers pay for tobacco.  Currently, obviously, cannabis is illegal. Currently, also, cannabis is a gateway drug because the same people that end up handling it, handle other hard core drugs. If it were legal, those people would have no desire to traffic marijuana because there would be no underground market (like there is no underground market for tobacco and alcohol). Therefore, marijuana would no longer be a gateway drug.  Making the argument that marijuana legalization would lead to Meth legalization, and THATS why we shouldn't legalize is pretty poor.

There would still be a lot of private growers to circumvent the taxes on it and to make it cheaper. I'd say the same for cigarettes, but tobacco is not the only thing in there. It's a precise mixture of dozens of substances and chemicals, so people can't exactly manufacture that on their own.",0
"I've already argued in favor of the legalization of marijuana, but there's one thing I forgot about. I watched ""Severance"" the other day, it's about a group of a European sales division of Palisade Defense are on a bus to a team-building weekend at a ""luxury lodge"" in the Mátra Mountains of Hungary. The team-building activities don't really work out till the they realize some wacko soviet soldiers are waiting in the woods to kill them one by one, only then they manage to form some sort of a group working together, helping each other, the survival of each is dependent on the survival of the team.  I figured that it might be a bit loose, but there is something about getting into drugs that brings back something that was lost during the arms race in the name of nape security. To illustrate - A few years ago I wrote a story about an alien civilization acting as if they were about to exterminate all humans, the aliens announced it on the news so a global panic was achieved, and nothing really happened, only that a feeling of survivalism boiled up everywhere, there was a greater power threatening from above, one intention over everyone, seeing all human kind as unified, ignoring our differences and difficulties with each other.

"I think the biggest reason that marijuana is illegal is a cultural one. If you've never smoked it, it's hard to describe how it makes you feel. The best way I can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. It slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. This leads me to my next part. It's going to require a leap, so follow me. The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, ""Do I really need that many THINGS?"", ""Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a ""boss""?"" ""Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?"" ""Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?""  There are other reasons that marijuana should be legal or at least decriminalized, but I believe this is the biggest obstacle: We might actually wake up and analyze what our lives are, what consequences our behaviors have on ourselves, our neighbors, and the rest of the world. We might stop consuming.",1
"Marijuana has been rated the least harmful drug in a study made in UK, which means that there is no less harm being done to people using the drug. Also, marijuana has evidence of pharmaceutical uses, such as treatment of glaucoma. Because marijuana can be addictive, the government could sell the drug with a high tax, which would shrink the number of users of marijuana, and at the same time, stimulate the economy with these high payments going to the government. Overall, as long people don't smoke marijuana (there are more ways to use marijuana outside of smoking it), legalizing marijuana would be beneficial.",1

"i actually wrote a persuasive essay on this not too long ago for my English class and i got a perfect score on it so i thought I'd share it with you all.      The Decision is Ours  Marijuana is a THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) containing plant which is illegal and discriminated against in all but a handful of countries. A number of the common effects of this plant include a euphoric feeling, stress reduction, deep thinking, pain relief, increased appetite, and a few negative effects such as lightheadedness or confusion. It has been argued for years whether the cannabis plant is a drug or simply a natural herb like any other with stronger side effects, many people considering both herb and drug to be the most logical answer. The earliest it is recorded to be utilized, orally and smoked, is 2700 B.C. in China and India, having been outlawed in the United States in the early 1900’s. Uses such as religious purposes, medicines, and relaxation; should marijuana be legalized? My belief is that there would be no harm in this change of law, and the economy would prosper from it.  The First Amendment stated in the United States Constitution Bill of Rights reads:  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  Religious peoples, for example Rastafaris, Shintos, Hinus, Buddhists, Sufis, Zoroastrians, Bantus, and many other sects, have traditions that require ganja as a part of their lifestyles and sacred ceremonies. All of these customs had been established long before the banning of the plant. So when prohibiting marijuana is that not taking away their first amendment right of freedom to exercise their religion?  Before its ban, marijuana was a major active ingredient in 40-50 percent of medicines. Nowadays it could be used to replace at least 10-20 percent of medicines. Marijuana has hundreds of proven uses from treating nausea, pain, multiple sclerosis (MS), glaucoma, and asthma to stress reduction and cancer therapy. If you have glaucoma, the third leading cause of blindness brought about by increased pressure in the eyeball, this herbs effects reduce pressure in the eyeballs and though other medications can be used for treatment they tend to lose efficiency over time. With MS the normal functioning of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord are disrupted, harsh debilitating attacks that come and go along with many uncomfortable symptoms that lead to eventual disability occur, the use of cannabis in this situation treats a number of the symptoms as well as delays the progression of the disease.  In the United States alone every 15 minutes someone is killed in an alcohol related accident, this is approximately 50 percent of all deadly car collisions. Just about half of industrial deaths and injuries can be linked to alcohol consumption. Along with those statistics four in ten criminals and three in four of domestic violence offenders have reported to have alcohol as the reason for their violent behavior. On an annual basis in the US alcohol kills about 80,000 people, as for marijuana - there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana, you are more likely to die from an overdose of asprin. In fact, as far as we know it is impossible to overdose on marijuana and contrary to the common belief it does not influence violence or crimes. Even all of the illegal drugs put together are responsible for a small percentage of deaths compared to tobacco, is it really fair that these more harmful and fatal substances are legal but marijuana is not?  During the rise of the Rastafaris in Jamaica a man named Leonard Howell owned a large amount of land he called Pinnacle. Pinnacle was designed as a place for Leonard and hundreds of his Ras Tafari followers to live separated from the accusing eyes of the public who viewed them as criminals and thought their ideologies to be absurd, most of his followers had been poor peasants but this all changed with the growth of their ganja plantation. They had grown and sold so much marijuana that they built shops and were able to care for themselves with plenty of extra money, the rest of the valley eventually depending on them for necessities such as food and the herb. In California marijuana is already the largest cash crop and the UN has estimated that 2.5 percent of the world’s population smokes cannabis, with cannabis legal and the government regulating it like every other product of America our economy would thrive.  To put it simply, the United States does not outlaw “junk” food and vending machines simply because it is bad for you, although they may be unhealthy it is the individuals choice on whether they want to consume them or not. It is the same with marijuana, though there are few minor health risks, it is the individuals’ responsibility to look at the pros and cons and make the decision they want. Should marijuana be legalized? My answer is yes, whether for religious uses, medical reasons, just recreational purposes, or merely because the government should not have the right to dictate the lives of their citizens if it is not harming society, the legalization of marijuana would produce no destruction to our social order and the economy would expand.  There are other reasons I think marijuana should be legalized, these are just the main ones. Hope you all enjoyed it =)",1

""According to a federal Institute of Medicine study in 1999, fewer than 10 percent of those who try marijuana ever meet the clinical criteria for dependence, while 32% of tobacco users and 15% of alcohol users do"" (http://www.drugpolicy.org/facts/ drug-facts/marijuana-facts).  So if you got ""addicted"" to marijuana, it's because you're a wimp looking for attention. ""A study at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada proves that marijuana actually stimulates brain cell growth"" (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/ 2005/10/051016083817.htm).

Furthermore, a study conducted in America (http://beforeitsnews. com/story/1530/375/ Study:_Smoking_Marijuana_Improves_ Driving_Skills.html)  showed ""the use of medical marijuana has caused traffic related fatalities to fall by nearly nine percent in states that have legalized medical marijuana.""

"Unlike tobacco and alcohol, marijuana is a gateway drug. Once you start on it, you want some more, until you grow tolerance and need something stronger.

I never waited for a guy to finish a joint so I could swoop in a finish the last few drags.",1
"Technically speaking, the war on drugs does employ people. So that's a plus to it, right? Besides, marijuana is illegal for a reason. People abuse the drug as it is. If they legalize it, the abuse will grow exponentially. This applies for any illegal substance. If alcohol is made legal, for example, underaged drinkers would drink so much more than they did when it was legal. Of course, this could slow down over time, but do we really want that initial boom of drug abuse which we don't know when it will end?",0
"If the U.S. were to legalize weed it could take us out of this recession due to the fact that they will tax the hell out of it.

"To say that it should be made legal because it is less harmful to you than alcohol or tobacco is not logical in any sense. The key term to realize here is HARMFUL. Whether it is more or less harmful than other legal drugs doesn't make a difference. It is illegal because of the negative effects it has on your body. To argue that, ""that isn't fair because alcohol and tobacco"" is stupid to say. My reasoning behind this is that alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because to try to make something illegal that has been legal for so long is nearly impossible. Back when America passed the prohibition laws, they didn't stop anyone from smuggling alcohol into the country. In fact, crime rates went up and eventually they had to re-legalize it.",0

"I'm sorry. I can't find anything of value in this argument. I say this to be realistic, not mean.   I'll go through it by points.   ""you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity""  People can be wrong, yes? That is why we debate... Or put this way: In a debate, your ""opinion"" (it should be argument) should be as respected as much as it is powerful. Democracy has nothing to do with this.   ""When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine...""  This debate is listed as: "" 'Informal conversation' on medical marijuana,"" but from here on I will consider only recreational use.   ""What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.""  Um, wow. Ok... The fact that you don't like weed means almost nothing. It proves nothing, it demonstrates nothing. Again, your opinion is not valid in a debate. Plus not a thing that you are saying is backed up. Let me paraphrase you to demonstrate: ""Weed is bad because I lose respect for people who are high. I feel that this must be the reason it's illegal, simply because I feel like it. I've heard arguments for using it and they are all wrong."" I'm not trying to be mean, but this paragraph is worthless. This lists only your feelings, and doesn't actually critique any arguments. But, let's continue.  OK. In your next paragraph you do not demonstrate how pot is a cancer (matter-of-fact it reduces cancer, though I realize that's not what you mean). WHY IS POT BAD FOR SOCIETY. Just saying it is bad for society is not informative or argumentatively sound. Also, ""Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug."" While alcohol is a mind altering drug, that is not the reason it brings social deviance. That is a fallacy. There are other things, but let's continue...  The next paragraph says that the government should secure domestic peace. (I'm trying to make what you said correct, because that is not the only function of government.)  The next one is all wrong. I having trouble deciphering it. I think you are trying to say that the government's job is hard cause there are ""many"" (try thousands if not more) drugs and more would complicate things. The problem with this is that the world is complicated, and you have not argued why less complication (when in opposition to things like personal freedom) is the de facto standard. Again, you have in no way backed up your claim. Also, weed is already a complication because the government must spend MASSIVE time and energy trying to stop it. Honestly I think it would be less complicated if it were legal.  In the next paragraph, you are concerned because more people will smoke and maybe do it in public. Again, why is any of this a problem. There are laws now that you cannot drink or be intoxicated in public (except in designated areas like bars... Speaking of bars, they are doing quite well so I'm not sure why you believe that most people stay home to drink). There is nothing stopping laws making it illegal to smoke in public. Not that it matters cause you have not demonstrated why this should be a concern.  OK, next.  sign  The addictive properties of a substance do not change when the legality of a substance changes. Also, marijuana truly is less addictive then both alcohol and nicotine. If necessary I will provide proof.   Next. There are plenty of people who want to deal with this subject, as evidenced by the ""hotness"" of this debate. The fact that you do not wish to is of no concern. What would get worse, and why/how would it get there if it were legalized. Again you have not once demonstrated what is actually wrong with marijuana aside from the fact that you don't like it.  Skip to the last paragraph. You argue that ""childish and petty insults"" ""suppress the voices of the citizens."" And you argue this... This is actually pretty cool because you have made yourself a demonstration of the fallacy of your argument... Do you see? You have spoke your ""voice"" of outrage at the ""childish and petty insults"" that prevent you from speaking your voice.  I'm truly not trying to insult you, but your skills of argumentation are very poor. I would suggest taking a Logic and Critical Thinking course.",1
Caffeine is also more addictive. I'm a slave to my morning caffeine fix - the day cant go on without it. Comparatively a much longer marijuana habit can be dropped and picked back up on a whim.,1

"It is not the governments business to protect me from myself. If you want that live in North Korea.

"First of all, legalization of marijuana will be beneficial for government in many ways. The government spends a huge amount of money to fight drugs, although these costs looks not so effective with the drug marijuana, because it is widely used, and in my opinion probably marijuana is no more harmful than currently legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. In a recent study for the Fraser Institute, Economist Stephen T. Easton, it was calculated how much tax revenue the Canadian government could gain by legalizing marijuana. So, the study estimates that the average price of 0.5 grams (a unit) of marijuana sold for $8.60 on the street, while its cost of production was only $1.70. If government legalize marijuana the price for it will fall because it will have become readily available + the government will get taxes.",1

"Marijuana addicts are to ""food addicts"" as apple pie is to peach pie. with pie being a psychologically addicted person.  Its not the chemical substance people become addicted to.

I'm assuming you haven't smoked weed before; it becomes pretty easy to imagine complete composition of a song in your head, compared to sobriety. While the effect of acid is more extreme in its increase of creativity, it's effect was narrow and short-lived on the music industry as a whole.

"Marijuana has huge amounts of byproducts which can be valuable to the community. Its medicinal properties are well known and studied. It would provide jobs across the country, provide hemp crops for textile use, and would provide large amounts of tourism revenue from potheads worldwide.  It provides an extra source of taxation for the government (they can tax pot as heavily as they do with cigarettes).   It also removes a major gateway to other more dangerous illegal substances.  Pot is possible to saliva test roadside, thus providing another area for the government to pull revenue from (drug driving).  It also frees up police officers who are busy chasing minor users, and enables them to go after more serious criminals.",1
"You fail to show what marijuana supposedly ""does to people"". There are few ill effects, even among the heaviest long-term smokers. But heavy, long-term repetition of most activities will have negative results (running, for example).  You also appear to be claiming that marijuana use is somehow a threat to domestic peace. You also seem to think it will magically develop addictive properties once its legal.  You fail to show why the law should be invasive enough to regulate what you put in your own body, or why the law should be used to legislate away things you don't like. Governments allow industry to put all kinds of toxins and waste into our food, air, and water, and the government gets paid to allow it, and all the citizens are forced to ingest it. No reason we shouldn't all have the right to knowingly poison ourselves.  Also, your argument seems to assume that many people would suddenly begin using marijuana who are not already, and there's no data to prove this. People are already spending their pot budgets, nothing would change there (except maybe they could grow it and save).  Your entire view of government is rather disturbing. ""The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace."" Citizen-control is  not  a constitutional principle, in fact our rights insulate us from overt control by the government.",1

We have laws against playing music too loud, but because people do it anyway, should we make playing music illegal?  Yes marijuana would be cheaper if legalized, you do not understand the way a black market works. Because the people growing, trafficking, and selling marijuana have to take huge risks, they make the price higher. Once legalized the price would lower. So your argument that there would be a blackmarket with cheaper prices is invalid.  Really the last thing we need as a country is more people doing marijuana? I can think of far worse things. Assuming that legalizing it would significantly increase use long term, which you don't have evidence for, what is the big deal? People do not end up at rehab for marijuana. It is not addictive. If they go to rehab it is because they have addictive personalities and are using it too much because of that, not because it is addicting. People with addictive personalities can need help for anything. Out of curiosity would you have slapped Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they created apple while smoking marijuana. Very intelligent and successful people habitually smoke marijuana. Just because unsuccessful gravitate toward toward it, does not mean it makes you unsuccessful. As we say in statistics, correlation does not imply causation.",1

""" Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal. ""  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)  And the website was about tobacco smoke. I knew that. But I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well.",0

I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above. I've made it thus far without them, and I don't have any real reason to start now. So, because of this, I can say that I have reasoning beyond what is simply personally more convenient.   The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads?

He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be ""friends"" with his dealer.

"1. Tobacco is _the_ most addictive substance known to man. Comparing it to cannabis in this way is a joke.  2. The numbers for marijuana related auto deaths compared to alcohol are laughable. Keep in mind many people also drive while on vicoden, anti-depressents, etc. The lesson here is don't drive if your fucked up (on anything).  3. Pfffffff. Arguing that the government would regulate it in a way that would increase the price is ridiculous. If I could buy a 'pack' of marijuana cigarettes for the same price as tobacco, even while tobacco is heavily taxed, that would be awesome and very very cheap. Have you heard the numbers that the government has been considering? I've heard $50 a plant for growing - a single plant can procure about 6 grand worth of medicine. It's still going to be cheap.  4. Just because you don't like it or how it effects other people gives you no right to make choices for others. Just like just because I don't like drinking doesn't mean I think everyone should be banned from drinking.  Even if you think Legalizing is not the solution - the war on drugs is also NOT the solution. A good solution might be to change the war on drugs to be the war on addiction, and then also legalize pot.",1
"i agree. Cannabis isn't 100% legal in any country in the whole world(for anyone who doesn't believe this, look it up(yes, it isn't legal in Amsterdam or Jamaica like people believe)). Since it isn't legal in any country in the whole world, then if we legalize it, all the gangs who sell cannabis will move to the United States, because they can do their operation without getting in trouble.

"I've known those people too. Those are the kids who I think it would happen to no matter what. From my experience, they generally have enormous issues. From my experience, they escalate from one drug to another in a very short time.   The people I'm talking about cutting off from the dealer are the ones who just want to relax on pot for a while, and have no real intention of ever turning to anything heavier. The ones who it takes a lot to get them to try anything new. The ones who after months and months of ""Just try it, on the house, no worries,"" finally give in thinking ""Just once."" That's how my ex started on speed. For years he had smoked pot, saying that doing anything else was a fool's game. But all his ""mates"" (i.e. his dealer and the guys he hung out with while he was at his dealer's house) were doing it, and they were all egging him on. So the first time, he tried it at a quarter dose. But he refused to inject it. He was adamant about that. He dropped balls... meaning he swallowed small amounts of speed wrapped up in cigarette papers. For about a year he tried it off and on, which was enough time for him to get well and truly hooked on it. At which point he started injecting it. I left him soon after. He's gone on to do pretty much everything since, and last I heard he was on the methadone program.  If pot had been available over the counter, I doubt that his habit would have escalated beyond pot. He would simply have been too lazy to go and find someone to sell him something illegal.",1

For a drug that is in some ways not as bad as alcohol, some ways worse, but overall about on the same level, I think that it should be legalised.

I don't know, I get the idea that this somehow has to do with morals or ethics, but it's only a feeling and when it comes down to it, my ""practical"" side says that it  should  be legalized, but still, I don't like people doing it... which is not the case with drinking.  So why do you think that people  shouldn't ?",0
"The government could make so much money if they just make it legal. First, they won't have to spend a lot of money trying to stop it. Trying to stop it this way is obviously not working. Second, the U.S. could make marijuana just another commodity. They could tax the use or the purchase of marijuana and actually make money.

End of story, the only negative to pot is the fact that you are inhaling it, and almost any inhalent does damage. so to wrap things up, any individual whom actually has negative things to say about marijuana are just UNINFORMED so look all this up because it is all correct. & within 5 years gaurenteed, it will be legal.",1

"1. why does each side have hundreds of points, but there are not arguements?  2. I'm glad you brought up this subject.   In the history of mankind, prohibition of any substance that one puts into their own body has never worked.  Alcohol was no more or less popular during prohibition, than now. The only difference was that instead of States and the feds recieving tons of tax dollars, and the money from alcohol purchase going into the hands of legitimate businesses that employed citizens who contributed to society and paid taxes,  all the money was going to gangsters and thugs.  Well, the same thing is going on now. Marijuana was not made illegal until 1937. Before then the plant was taxed. It employed people. Now it is not taxed, and those who sell it are usually criminals of some sort (though many are harmless)  Still, the amount of marijuana consumed has not diminished one bit.  Cannabis has been used all through recorded history.   link    What makes us think that now, in the last 72 years something about the plant has changed.  Marijuana's illegal status is a historical farce. It's laughable, pointless, and counter productive.  1. Marijuana is a better pain killer, with less harmful side effects than any perscription drug. It costs less (0 if you have dirt and water already) and it's less addictive.  Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene.   2. Taxes collected from the sale of marijuana would be in the hundreds of millions, it would give our economy an enourmous boost and employ potentially hundreds of thousands of people.  3. It would take the money from illegal drugs  out of  the hands of criminals.  4. It would be a huge relief on our overcrowded prisons, saving States hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, even millions in States with large prison populations like CA. Also, it would save the 18 year old A student and college hopeful from losing all his scholarships and having to check  YES  on every application that asks if they've ever been arrested, for the rest of his or her life, just because they had a tiny amount of a plant that is far safer than alcohol.  and by all means, come visit my blog sometime, www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.",1

"Actually it hasn't been proven. It could be linked to the person's lifestyle, or the fact that some people start smoking weed to cope with mental problems in the first place. However, it can affect memory, only if you are high literally all the time.  The worst thing I've seen happen is the person slows down a bit and starts being lazy because they find being sober too boring.   ""Have you ever looked at your hand? I mean really looked at your hand?...oh, yeah. Sorry, man...Chronic misuse of marijuana has been widely identified as a significant risk factor for those with a predisposition towards developing various mental illnesses, particularly schizophrenia. However, it should be noted that people with mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder often ""self-medicate"" to relieve the symptoms of their disorders. Scientific studies of marijuana use, like the one released on 26 June 2007,[1] rarely take into account that the mental disorders of habitual users often go undiagnosed until after the patient has become a habitual marijuana user. It's possible that studies like the one mentioned above are politically motivated. People with pre-existing mental disorders also tend to abuse alcohol and tobacco. Yet, similar studies linking booze and cigarettes - both legal and heavily taxed - to mental illnesses are less common than those that focus just on marijuana. Therefore, the link between marijuana use and mental illness may be an instance when correlation does not equal causation.  Recent studies also indicated that brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus may shrink due to extremely chronic use, on the order of five ""marijuana cigarettes"" a day for upwards of twenty years, in the case of one study.""   -Rationalwiki article on weed",0

However if your responsibilities are finished it is better you enjoy yourself than be a robot who thinks its wrong to enjoy things be it cannabis, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. Either way, ethics or morals it doesn't matter I still don't see why someone else ought to live by your personal ethics/morals.   And your correct that leisure does not require marijuana however some people enjoy using marijuana in their leisure time. And unless we want to set up a draconian system to make all pleasures wrong (which you would probably support) it is hypocritical to allow some substances and not others, especially if those other substances are less harmful.  You still have not given a reason to keep drugs illegal. It is an inconsistent argument and if we want to start taking away one persons right to what they enjoy in their spare time when will it stop?

"I could easily write a book, on all the reasons why this prohibition should end.  Simply though... This prohibition hasn't had any effect, it hasn't accomplished or even gotten close, to it's own goals. And more and more evidence is piling up, showing that legalization doesn't make things any worse off than they are now. So all we are doing by having this prohibition, is arresting and jailing and violating the private rights of our citizens. Prohibition also creates a black market, that we could easily destroy via legalization... Along with the crime and violence that comes with that.  In my mind, no one else should have any greater authority over your own body, than you. And no one should have the right to tell you, that you can't do something that you want, to yourself. We are adults living in a free country, Why do we not have the right to make such choices? As long as we act responsibly, and don't harm others, what is our crime?  At the very least, We shouldn't be locking people up, for non-violent non-victim ""crimes"".  BTW, I believe decriminalization will not solve the important issues.

Like the studies claiming to show damage to the reproductive system, this myth is based on studies where animals were given extremely high-in many cases, near-lethal-doses of cannabinoids. These results have never been duplicated in human beings. Interestingly, two studies done in 1978 and one done in 1988 showed that hashish and marijuana may have actually stimulated the immune system in the people studied.  Marijuana is much more dangerous than tobacco?   Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens as does an equivalent amount of tobacco. It should be remembered, however, that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco than a heavy marijuana smoker consumes marijuana. This is because smoked tobacco, with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive of all drugs while marijuana is less addictive than caffeine; like soda or coffee. Two other factors are important. The first is that paraphernalia laws directed against marijuana users make it difficult to smoke safely. These laws make water pipes and bongs, which filter some of the carcinogens out of the smoke, illegal and, hence, unavailable. The second is that, if marijuana were legal, it would be more economical to have cannabis drinks like bhang (a traditional drink in the Middle East) or tea which are totally non-carcinogenic. This is in stark contrast with ""smokeless"" tobacco products like snuff which can cause cancer of the mouth and throat. When all of these facts are taken together, it can be clearly seen that the reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than tobacco, that's a fact.   Is there are over a thousand chemicals in marijuana smoke?  Again, true but misleading. The 31 August 1990 issue of the magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals present in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on animals and 16 of these cause cancer in rodents. Yet, coffee remains legal and is generally considered fairly safe.   . NATURE OF MARIJUANA: Marijuana (derived from the Cannabis sativa plant) is not a pure, single-chemical substance. Marijuana is a complex, unstable mixture of over four hundred chemicals that, when smoked, produce over two thousand chemicals.   Is there a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee?  Yes! Scientists have identified over 1,000 different chemicals in a cup of coffee. But how many of the 1,000 or more chemicals have been tested in animal cancer studies? Only 22--leaving 978 compounds in your morning java about which we know very little. And of those 22 that were tested, were any found to be carcinogens, or cancer-causing compounds? Seventeen of the 22 are, in fact, carcinogens. Also when you roast your cup of coffee the chemicals get in bigger numbers to over 1,500 chemicals in a signal cup of coffee. Think about that in the morning, when your getting your hot cup of coffee.  So coffee can be just as bad and good as weed or marijuana. So even that I don't smoke it at all. I supported because its has no reports of deaths just like coffee and also that it helps people stress, which is a big factor in this country. Which stress can cause health problems to the heart and body. Its also cuts down or burns of body fats to become thinner in a safer way then tobacco and lose weight pills/drugs that can hurt you that could case death faster, when there is no record death ever in marijuana. This is another way to have a healthy way to live for the thousands or millions can used marijuana to help them.

"I don't think the legalization of marijuana would be a good idea.   Why does everyone push so hard for it, when all it does is make you high???  Talk about mindless self indulgence... I hate people who have problems dealing with the fact that they cannot always have what they  want .",0
"The Legalization of marijuana would lower are crime rates in the United States of America by at least 15 to 20%. A lot of the US citizens have either used, grew, or sold Marijuana and have gotten caught by the police if we legalized Marijuana we could put restrictions on the use growth and sells of marijuana so that he people who sell grow and use it can sell grow and use it just under certain restrictions.",1
"Marijuana is no more harmful than tobacco or alcohol, if taken in moderate quantities. Tobacco and alcohol are both legal and widely used in the US, regulated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

"Honestly, I thought this debate was over. I got enough opposition. :)  But when I look into legalizing something, I try to look at the worst case scenario and a likely scenario and combine them. In the case of pot, I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions (don't say it's not addicting. I  know  people that are addicted.) Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America. Productivity would go down :) and some people would simply do reckless things.",0

"So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your ""common sense"" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.   No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Marijuana is not addictive.   ""According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old."" -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.   That is not at all my logic. if it was, I would have said that we should keep marijuana illegal because people get it illegally. Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   Marijuana does not hurt anybody   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.",0
"It would be loads of empathy and joy for about 6 hours, then irrational, stimulant-induced paranoia. If we can expect the former to bring about peace on Earth, the latter would surely bring about WWIII. =D",0

"I agree. I hate how their's so many shows nowadays about how pot should be legalized or how theirs shows that show the medical pot stores in california and how pople hold rallies and riot to try and get pot legalized. I have smoked pot atleast 150+ times in my life(i haven't smoked pot in atleast 7+ months, and have only smoked it 4 times in the last 4 years), so i know what it's like to be high, and the only way i could see someone thinking that marijuanna is a medicine would be if your high when you say that. Their is no way that marijuanna could be a medicine. I hated the feeling of being high, and if you look up Cannabis and mental disorders, then you'll find that cannabis does more harm to you than good(the only reason people say it's good is because it numbs them and makes the pain go away).    I personally think that if they legalize it, then The United States will sooner or later fall apart.",0
Cannabis has been proven to have health benefits .,1
"The argument you're using is what they call a ""slippery slope rationalization"" and it's completely flawed. If Marijuana is directly connected to harder drug use, then cigarettes lead to marijuana use and they should also be illegal... This makes about as much sense as saying that 6th graders playing ""spin the bottle"" leads to unprotected premarital sex. And if pot proceeds really went to terrorists, then we should legalize it, tax it, regulate it, gain the profits ourselves, and eliminate the terrorists' market. Also, apathy can be fueled by many many things aside from pot. I don't see anyone racing to ban television.",1
It should never have been made illegal in the first place.,1
"Nobody knows the exact answer on this question. I think we should try to do it and then we will learn it will help or not. To talk on this topic right it or wrong is too early. I think we cannot judge about it until we actually use it on practice because who knows what will be in the future, maybe, what i've said before it is a solution for this problem!",1
"Well, I would almost agree with that, but then that creates a huge black market all over again that is completely unregulated. People will be harming themselves with dirty alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs because of lack of regulation on these substances. It's currently a problem with cannabis because it's illegal.  You are on the right track though, making them illegal is definately the wrong way to go about it.",1
"Yeah, I think the reason it's gone on so long is dealers and laundering banks make their money under the black market system. But it could change again. Look at prohibition.  The biggest effect would be an end to brutal mandatory sentencing of long jail times that has ruined so many young peoples lives.",1

If it was as dangerous as you seem to think it is surely it should be easy to find one.   ""And pot is addicting. I know people, on a personal level, who are addicted to marijuana. You cannot deny that. ""   Unless you are a doctor you are not qualified to diagnose an addiction in someone. And are you really going to try to use anecdotal evidence to combat scientific claims that it is not physically addictive. Just because someone does something a lot does mean it is addictive, that is a common misconception.  No you didn't come up with a negative factor of marijuana that it does not share with tobacco or alcohol, you came up one they share but said it is worse with marijuana, which it isn't anyway. Come up with something unique to marijuana, do you know what that word means?  It has never been proven that cigarette smoke causes cancer? You are joking right?  You think that inhalation of marijuana smoke can lead to cerebral hypoxia? Unless you inhale almost pure smoke continuous for a few minutes that can't happen. Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal.   How do you think doing a few bong hits leads to complete brain oxygen depletion for any amount of time whatsoever let alone an hour?

Marijuana has more of an addiction effect than alcohol does.   Whoa! Now that is just not true. Have you consumed both? When I was younger I smoked daily for years... one day I decided I was wasting money and was tired of sitting around and staring so I just quit. There was  NO  addiction at all in my case.

"I'm not that concerned with Marijuana. I'd never use it, and I don't let my boyfriend either. I think it is a cop-out and a rather stupid thing to get into.   I don't mind it being legalized, though I'd rather it not. I'd even go so far as to say alcohol shouldn't be legal either.   I don't, however, like the way these things are prosecuted. I'd rather see users treated like those in need of medical and psychological attention. There shouldn't be anything on their permanent records, they shouldn't go to jail or prison, and they shouldn't be stigmatized.   Users should be sent through rehabilitative structures and helped to find better ways to spend their time and money. Educating themselves, expanding their minds, getting good jobs, having fun in more productive ways. Users should be helped towards a better, happier life without the need for mind altering chemicals.   Pushers, however, are a different matter. Small-timer pusher and pushers of less dangerous drugs should go through the same services. But people selling deadly, horribly destructive drugs to people are partially responsible for their downward spiral. They should be punished, with jail time and prison time (depending on what they did and how they did it) followed by rehabilitation and job training/higher education.",0
"So is smoking tabaco and drinking alcohol.   and those are legal...  so, why not marijuana?",1
"If we legalized marijuana, it would likely bankrupt the cartels, which are profitable because they are the biggest ""under the table"" distributer. People would have no reason to buy from them when they could grow their own, or buy it cheaply from WalMart.

If it is legalized, we need to be prepared to dump unlimited capital case appeals and do some executing.",1
"Yes, we would take away the war between us and mexico. but if we have to chose between that and the cartel shooting in our streets I know which one I would chose. There is always a double effect.

This process would use only 1/4 to 1/7 as much polluting sulfur-based acid chemicals to break down the glue-like lignin that binds the fibers of the pulp, or even none at all using soda ash. The problem of dioxin contamination of rivers is avoided in the hemp paper making process, which does not need to use chlorine bleach (as the wood pulp paper making process requires) but instead safely substitutes hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching process. ...
