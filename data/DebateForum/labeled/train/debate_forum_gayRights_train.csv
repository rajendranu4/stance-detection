You are not a good person if you take freedom away from someone without cause.  You are not a good person if you shove your religion down the throat of non-believers.  You are not a good person if you deride another's love as unworthy.  These things make you a  disgusting  person.,1
"Does anyone really think their family is absolutely normal?  And what about all the children being raised by single moms and dads who've divorced, or never married? They're teased in school too.",1
I'm glad gays can't reproduce maybe one day but not today I will always hate gays and so will everybody I know :),1
"Maybe not, but there is an emotional reason to engage in homosexual behavior",1
"However, they DO NOT get to claim the title of marriage and receive the benefits of marriage when there is no such a thing!  http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/marriage   read it and weep!   Please read my first argument, where you will see me clearly accept that a gay marriage is technically impossible. However, we can bend the rules a little bit, and Merriam Webster agrees with me. I quote   the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage  .  So, as you can see, gay marriage is possible in a non-technical way.   It is not recognized by our constitution as a right. The end. And it won't get added. If a state wants to legalize it they can try.   Firstly, that's your constitution, not mine. Now, I'll be honest. I don't know a great deal about the constitution. But I know that it's not the be all and end all of everything. Public support for gay marriage is at an all time high. The President publicly came out to support it. If that's not convincing enough, I don't know what is.",0
"If love is the criteria for marriage what do you do with all the arranged marriages that occurred throughout history, are they not marriages by your definition.   This notion of romantic love proceeding marriage is a fairly recent development. It used to be that love developed and grew within the context of a lifelong commitment. We have just reversed the order. And we wonder why over 50% of marriages end in divorce. Before we remove a fence we ought to ask why it was there in the first place.  About equality; it depends on what you mean by equality.  About differences: it ought to persuade you if you recognize a difference. Because that's the whole point of the debate. Some people want to say there is no difference when there clearly is one.",0
"1st. . .the question is not is being gay good, bad or indifferent? It is about gay marriage.  For the record I have not one issue with the type, sex, number or racial, religious background of peoples bed, shed or head partners. Consenting adults can consent to anything.  So unless someone says ""ew your gay!?"" stick to the subject please and quit reading even more into the topic than you already are. . .  Sure let's use the analogy of the animal kingdom. Sure gay relationships abound. . .but how about a gay mated pair? And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?",0
"i just wanted to add this,  but   since aids comes from monkies....  im pretty sure gay people didnt spread the first strain through humanity.   i would venture to guess, that some straight guy out in the jungle on some expedition thing, got really horny and fucked a monkey.   a gay guy, would just go have sex with the other gay guys there. and, they tend to be cleaner and pickier, so i dont think they would go for a monkey....  0.0  (yes, an immature thing to say, but hey, alot of the people here are already saying stupid crap, i thought id add this too)",1
"Then if you're different pick a different word. Traditionally marriage has meant a union between a man and a woman. To use the same word for same sex partners dilutes the word and makes it less descriptive. It also pisses of the religious right and makes for great CD fodder ;)  You claim to be different but you want to seen as the same. That doesn't make any sense to me. Let us see you as different and accept you for what you are. There's no need to put a requirement forcing us to see you as the same.  BTW, claiming that gays are genetetically different and supporting genetic engeneering means that someday some one will want to eradicate the gay gene. It's a two edge sword that cuts both ways. You have to love it ;)  Remember, vote twice, vote often ;)",1
"What are you talking about? I was responding to the fact that truthfinder said gay marriage went against ""laws of god as seen in science."" I never stated my opinion as to whether homosexuality was good, bad or neither, either. I was disputing his ideas. Laws  should  be based on rationality. But how does gay marriage harm anyone? Truthfinder's answer was nonsensical; almost as nonsensical as your questions are.    And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?   I can't even respond to that because it makes no sense! From now on, reread what you type and think ""what the fuck am I talking about"" before you press the submit button. Okay?",1
"No, it's nothing like that. Actually, I see Avedomni over there has put it better than I can -- you're conflating description with definition.   How is it not like it? How am I conflating description with definition when I am talking about the order of something?   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to tolerate it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   I do want to force you to tolerate it? Wow! maybe I'm wrong but that doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.  You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent. Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone. Maybe you should be more open minded to the fact that they might not be morally equivalent.   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just is.    You wouldn't say it's a good thing? You just said that racial integration was a good thing and gay marriage is it's moral equivalent. So how is that not saying this is a good thing if this a part of gay marriage?    Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives. Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good. Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude.   Sorry, Loss of hope leads to depression and depression leads to suicide. Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   See when you tell someone they are born gay and can't change; you shut the door on them and say there is no way out; you seal their fate and condemn them to death.  I however throw the door open and say; your behavior doesn't define you, you can change and there are thousands who have. That's hope and that saves lives.   Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.   Oh there it is, the myth of neutrality and genetic fallacy all rolled in one. Nice job jesseald! Facts are annoying things aren't they? But waving the magic wand of neutrality doesn't make them go away. And neither does disparaging the source of those facts.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   Let me see if I understand you.   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.   So what do ya do with all those people who change their behavior? And why are you trying to persuade me to change my behavior towards homosexuality.  Wow! So you are a fatalist. DNA is destiny right? Oh wait, were is that gene? what they can't find it! darn.  By making this argument you deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul). Your argument therefore assumes naturalism. Oh but wait, your argument is full of moral judgments and thoughts. Darn! those abstract realities always mess things up.",0
Hell no! Leave that crap up to the individual states to decide! MORE STATE'S RIGHTS!,0
I applaud your ability to not impose your personal beliefs on others. If only more religious people could be like you.,1
"whilst god does not discriminate it says in the bible that man must not lie with man, this geeration seems to think that you are above the law of the bible and if this is so just look towards god and ask him 'am i allowed?' and the answer will be do as you will but ot for lust only for love   jacob  yet the systematic abuse of this freedom to sleep with whom and whoever you want for love was jesus lega cy and he said for give them father for they know not what they do and this was his last words as a man so do you really want to go behind gods back and show yourself as heathans he died for you once and when the second coming arrives he shall do it again if you caqn live with the shame for breaking of the covenants is your forty pieces of silver if your heart is breaking speak to jeasus if you have lost your faith speak to the lord but if you continue to be promiscuous without asking for forgiveness then you may have your money and laugh for the lords say it will not happen again",0

"""I can't prove to you that my religion is true, but I can tell you that I know that it is.""   No, you don't ""know"" that Christianity is right, you have  faith  in Christianity.  Knowledge has a rational foundation.  Faith is unfounded and irrational.  The problem with faith is that when people of two different faiths conflict, how do we decide which one is right? If you have faith in Christianity and another person has faith in Islam, how do we decide who is right? We can't, because neither belief has a rational foundation.",1
"Your first argument compares two things that are not related; this is a fallacy of faulty analogy. The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child. The argument does not deductively evidence why any person, gay or not gay, can raise and love a child. Moreover, you have asserted that homosexuals are not able to conceive children. Therefore, we can deduce from your claim that homosexuals are biologically deprived of the necessary organs for the conception of a child. Lastly, the argument is ineffective in proving any thing syllogistically. And as for the remainder of your claims and rhetorical questions they don’t deserve refutation. The entirety of the argument fails to prove one thing that has been validly deduced by the author.    Your final statement,” The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay.”   A. It is a sentence fragment. The subject is identified but there is no predicate.   B. You affirmed there is something that is existentially negative about being gay; they cannot conceive children.   Your whole of your argument begins with irrationality and ends with irrationality.  I expect that your future reply will also be equally irrational.",0
"a good point, no one else has brought up the parents. and not wanting my opinion to be misconstrued, i would like to say that if gay marriage was accepted, and gay people themselves, i dont think that the parents would be hurt so much. i think they are mostly hurt because they dont think it is good for their kids bc society like to push that opinion.",1
"First, you are making a hasty generalization.   second, your making an anecdotal argument.   3rd; If gays could marry and were accepted, your father wouldn't of used your mother to hide and try to deny who he was, further more there may of been less social stigma and he might of stuck around.   4th. Marriage, in this sense, is strictly a governmental institution; NO one, or at least very few, is even hinted that churches should be forced to marry anyone. There are legitimate legal rights and privileges granted to married couples by government, and there is no secular reason to deny them these rights based on their sexuality. Marriage is not only a religious or cultural thing, but a governmental one.",1
"Hmmmm.   I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.  God give me the strength to change the things I can,  the patience to put it with the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference.",1
It spoils children's lives    Many children from heterosexual families have also been known to become homosexuals.   -  Are you implying that being gay spoils someones life?,1
"That's right, ants are another example. We have red ants and black ants. The red ants are called Solenopsis and the black ants are called Lasius niger. These words are common among scientists that study ants. Your average person doesn't deal much with ants so they don't need to describe them any further than red and black. However, your average person does deal with couples in a relationship and therefore more descriptive words are needed.  Now, the fact that  you  think that is not a good reason means nothing. Who the hell died and left you as the person responsible for determining what is and isn't a good reason?",0
"omg what are you saying that if gay people start getting married there wont be anymore procreation...are you like 5 years old,the laws of attraction wont differ if gay men are getting married or no,that will only make a difference for gay people straight people will not be affected. either way gay people wont make other people gay,so procreation is still gonna happen. your point of view is so silly and has no sens. and by your logic it means that homosexuality is a plague wish is so wrong,how can you explain the existence of a gay person then? a woman and a men no???? if your friend is gay doesn't mean UL be infected or everyone around him will be gay that is so absurd. go read some more psychology people before you get influenced by your instinctive reason that was forged by ignorant individuals.",1
What? there is too a heterosexual relation ship and homosexual relationship. I've seen it with my own eyes. Your logic makes no sense.  Love = Love is not the same for all players.  I love my daughters and I love my wife. It's not the same kind of love. Gay love making and heterosexual love making is different. One leads to procreation. ;),0
"That is a pretty appalling system.   I agree :)   You asked me if it bothered me/others to see them. That is my feelings on the matter. I don't tend to see it unless I happen to be in a gay bar, but that isn't often. While I don't really care, some people do. And unfortunately 51% of voters are allowed to oppress everyone else. My concern is that gay marriage is being voted against, which means that more people don't like seeing it than those that can be bothered to vote for something which will probably never affect them. And while we may disagree with the result, it's hard to argue with democracy.   Wow, I didn't think people could ever be so stupid. They just want people to look at them selves, than to look at gays  Im not saying that its your opinion, but if people really think that, they're crazy.  I really don't know wich side you're on actually :P Its okay to be natural tho",0

"Andrew, how old are you and what could you know about what can ""screw up a kid?"" I'll need some back-up on your blanket statement which makes little sense to those who are a bit older and more well versed.",1
"Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other.    I never implied that.    As do I. But it is not right for me to dictate my SUBJECTIVE beliefs onto others out of some perverted sense of duty. That is absurd.   I believe this ""belief"" is truth and the truth must be said.   Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other   I don't find what you stated as a dispute. If it was intended to be one. if it was intended to be a dispute then you are wrong because when i stated ""growing in numbers"" i didn't meant adoption. I meant producing children into this world.   In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children. In that sense, it is naturally wrong. In another sense, it is right to be homosexuals because you can stop overpopulation. These are two contradicting statements showed by ReventonRage and RiceD. However, these statements are truthful in their own perspective. I understand that homosexuals can't have kids. They can adopt children and thus, support the advancement of the human race. Homosexuals, like non-homosexuals, can become scientists and mathmaticians that supports the advancment of the human race. Im just providing more senses in which being a homosexual is right.   You know what? I proved that facts can be contradicting. Homosexuals can't produce children and in that sense, it is wrong. However, they stop the world from overpopulation. In that sense, it is right. I know those statements are contradicting but i can't deny that both of them are correct in their own little perspectives.  Edit. If you read my other comments then you will already know that i think i went a little off topic with mine. I thought marriage meant having children so that is why i went into the discussion of children. Therefore, the discussion of children lead me to the purpose of life. If the author of this debate didn't meant marriage as in having children afterwards, then my comment should be dismissed. Ignored but not forgotten. lol.   It is contradicting. Im surprised myself. I said that a lot. However, i can say the same for non-homosexual people as well. They support life and they don't support life. Im just saying this so you don't imply that i don't think this.",1

"That is astounding. You managed to use so many words to say so little. You were an English major weren't you?   ""I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented""   I see you have difficulty reading so I will bold what I wrote earlier.   ""The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8.""   Same-sex marriage is not unprecedented.   ""Particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody""   Just like forcing the new definition of the word marriage as being interracial as well. How can you not see that this is exactly the same thing?   ""I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"".""   I never said words do not have meaning. And pondering meanings of words is not what I was criticizing you for. I was criticizing you for complaining that the natural progression of society and therefore its means of communication, language, amounts to a destruction of language.   ""Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used.""   No they were not all on your side. They never wrote anything about gay marriage or the changing of language of being its destruction. Wow you are really intellectually dishonest. They were authors who naturally were quite concerned with the meaning of the language they used to write their works, but that doesn't mean they were concerned with language changing. Please stop misrepresenting the truth.   ""Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.""   Here's a great example of your meaningless pseudo-intellectualism. ""Underlying reality"" is a meaningless phrase. Try to actually say something concrete next time. If you actually knew anything about language, you would understand what a joke it is to say that saying marriage is also between a man and a woman is a drastic change to language. Why don't you take a look at the archaic words and archaic definitions that are no longer used and then talk to me about drastic change. This change of the terms of marriage is incredibly slight. Yours is one of the worst arguments against gay marriage I have heard. At least Christians saying it goes against their holy book is factually correct, even though this is legally and philosophically incorrect. Merriam-Webster's definition of the word ""marriage"" includes same-sex marriage by the way.   ""This may sound academic, but it is not!""   At least you have one thing right.   ""This may seem outlandish to the  provintial  mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.""   I like when people deliberately use bigger words in a condescending way to sound smart and then spell them incorrectly. It tickles my irony bone.  And your argument if I can call it that about government censorship is lame. The fact that another government does something is not justification for it. I will spare you the holocaust analogies because I am still hoping you are intelligent enough to see now how stupid your point is.   ""The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.""   Oh my gosh you have uncovered the LGBT movement's secret plot. Their plan must have been to destroy civilization by destroying our language by making civil rights apply to them thereby changing the language. Blast those sexual deviants. Good thing you solved the mystery Nancy Drew.",1
"Keep it out of the church. That would just be a whole mess and wars would break out. However, why shouldn't gays marry in a legal sense? It doesn't hurt anybody and it doesn't affect me in any way. If gays want to miserable for the rest of their lives, then let them. ;)",1

I guarantee if they had listened to your advice from the start you would be complaining about how they  weren't  following the law (which you actually seem to be doing as well, ironically enough).   If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.   By getting married gays aren't forcing anything on others. You could argue that allowing blacks to go to the same bathrooms and schools as whites was forcing racists to do something they didn't want.   And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Actually it's not me, but the supreme court that argued that marriage is a fundamental right.  source  Maybe you should check your sources before making claims that are demonstrably wrong.  So yes, homosexuals  are  fighting for rights. Not benefits, not to force their views on others...  rights .",1

"First of all, the two options for this debate are a bit limiting and ambiguous. If we define ""hurt"" as directly set back or disadvantage, then no, gay marriage doesn't hurt even the most vehement of bigots. However, if we define ""hurt"" as having any influence in which a person may deem negative to themselves, then yes, it is very possible that it does.  I've sided with the ""doesn't hurt anyone"" because in GENERAL and DIRECTLY it does not influence people who oppose it.  John and Jim getting married and having sex behind closed doors, does not affect the daily life of big Pastor Joe in a direct way.  However, the long term social and political effects will have very real consequences for both Pastor Joe and the rest of society.  If we examine the effects of abortion laws, especially the revision those of 1973, we see how it is possible for legislation intending to provide more individual freedoms may affect the social dynamic. The 1.7 million abortions a year are seen with a more liberal attitude after Roe and other similar historic legal moments.  Compare the average attitude on abortion in 1920 to today, and you will find that the social dynamic has changed. As society becomes more liberal on a certain issue because of legislation, it is possible that Pastor Joe is now surrounded with a warped culture he does not enjoy. This culture, the effects of gay marriage, may very possibly ""hurt"" Pastor Joe in the sense that he is not happy with the effects of allowing it, later down the road.  Forced to chose one of the absolutist sides, ""Doesn't hurt anyone"" -- In general, right now, if John and Jim wish to go get a married, this does not influence my life. In an ideal philosophy, the actions of two consenting adults in private are of no business to anyone but themselves, thus ""doesnt hurt anyone.""",1

"Do you even have a clue about the history of marriage? Seriously.  Marriage has meant plenty of things over the millenia. It's not about a word, it's about a right. There were those who said blacks couldn't marry whites once upon a time. The same rhetoric was used against them. Gays are entitled to the word marriage just like anyone else because no one owns that word and any connotation that you ascribe to that word has a historical context that has changed over time and will change more over time. Separate is not equal.",1

"In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.    Not many had open gay relations   So homosexuality isn't immoral since time immemorial, glad to see you agree on that.  In ancient Greece the male form was considered the ideal of beauty and the ancient Romans were fond of rampant homosexuality. If there was no gay marriage then I don't see how it impacts now, do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery, NO. Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO. (OK we still have these things in some more devoutly religious  and obviously morally advanced:)  countries.)  But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments. The fact that in the western world that the only real opposition to things like gay marriage comes from the religious communities is telling of their archaic and flawed morality. Gay people can not help being the way they are, it is not a belief system, or a choice it is an ingrained hormonally shaped sexuality, and if you are not this way you should count yourself lucky. Imagine being brought into a world where the very nature of yourself is ridiculed on any given day, where want you feel drawn to without explanation or choice is being chastised by huge groups of people, people that do not want to listen to evidence or reason, they KNOW they are right and that is that, and they WILL make your life hell because they deem themselves superior and in the right. A gay couple can not get married in a religious ceremony, so if they are not put together in the eyes of whichever God it is then it should not matter to the religious if Gay people had a legal ceremony or not.    TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that   They are not in line with you mate, as I said before in ancient Greece and Rome homosexuality was rampant and anyway even if ancient civilizations are in line with you then that shows where your morals stand, outdated and archaic.",1
"I don't know anyone who decided to be gay? How do you know. I in point of fact know a very nice and happy gay man, who was once engaged and has told me to my face that he was a happy straight man, did some experimentation, found someone he really liked who was a man and made a choice to live a gay lifestyle. He said he was happy either way, but thinks this is what makes him happiest.  I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't. And after reading more of the responses on here it just gets back to this absurd point that those of us who are ""opposed"", and I use this term loosely because to tell you the truth, until the prop 8 fiasco in which the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me I honestly didn't give a damn, to gay marriage are hated, disposed, called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.  The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons. I honor democracy and I despise hatred and bigotry, and it saddens me that this seems to make me the enemy of the homosexual community, which wants tolerance only for their way of thinking.",0
"Our country was not founded on YOUR set of morals and religious beliefs. We live in a pluralistic society in which many religious and non-religious practices co-exist. To enforce religious practices of a particular religion, would destroy any sense of  NEUTRALITY  the government may have regarding religion. You cannot ban something because it is against your religious beliefs because not everyone shares your religious beliefs.  the fact that homosexual activities are  already legal  makes it seem like homosexual activities are okay. Marriage isn't even part of that equation. I don't think there is anything wrong with homosexuality and what people do in the privacy of their own homes shouldn't be any of your concern.  Gay marriage is already legal in a lot of places and those places seem to be doing fine.  Nor are we in any danger of running out of people, the United states is one of the most populated Countries (#3 I believe) in the world. We have some 300 million Americans with no shortage in sight.

C) Articles written by women obviously biasedly focusing on some inequalities. They never mention how men died in their millions so that women could live.   And articles written bt men are bias towards women.  Was it only for the sake of women that were wars fought for, not for land, freedom, religion, wealth, to protect everyone.   last I checked everyone was different and all people are too be treated as equals.   Glad to see you agree that homosexual people should be treated as equals.   Last I checked paedophiles (etc. etc.) were not treated as equals either. You want gay rights.. you best give all these sick fucks rights.   The treatment of paedophiles should have no bearing on this debate if you want to debate that I would advise setting up a debate on it. Giving rights to Gay people is not the same, paedophiles are sexual predators that destroy lives, Gay people are not and do not.   Call the gays civil partners then. Not married. Simples.   Why, because you say so, not going to happen, don't you live in England where the rights of same sex couples to get married are law, have fun trying to change that.

"From a functonal perspective, sex is designed for procreation to ensure the survival of a species. However, in contemporary society, sex is also a form of pleasure. A human being's mind is very complex capable of everything from philosophical thought to emotional depth beyond that of mere animals. Pleasure/happiness helps keep us sane. The same way fear helps keep people alive. Regardless whether your Vulcanian logic find emotions to be ""illogical,"" the point is they exist. Their presence is not accidental. The logic is we should pass laws that make society happy while not infringing on the rights of others. Not create laws that would make sense in a world that doesn't exist: an emotionless species with a population problem. However, the issue isn't about legalizing gay sex. The issue is gay  marriage.   Marriage  on the other hand is a legal contract between two people asking society to recognize them as a family unit conferred with certain rights (health administrative proxies, administration of estates, etc...) How consenting adults choose to have sex should have nothing to do with denying them rights. Furthermore, a law prohibiting gay marriage isn't grounded in logic rather religious dogma. Archaic laws grounded in religious dogma should not be dictating rights in a secular society.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.   My ultimate point here is that claiming Homosexuality results in the spread of disease is irrelevant to the argument because so does heterosexuality when done without protection.",1

You're straight...you were born that way. 90% of the rest of the world is gay because they were born that way. Could I or anyone convince you, or would you be happy if someone were to try and change you into being gay? I don't think that would be possible, do you?  It's also interesting to me that the churches have softened their views of this too. Not the Catholic church but others. Some even ordain gay people into the priesthood or the ministry. That tells me something has changed through the years. Could it be the medical findings of all those poor dead people who succumbed to AIDS that changed their minds?

Better no parents than good parents, is that it? If heterosexual couples were already adopting 100% of kids up for adoption then this ""who will they talk to about this issue and that issue"" bullshit might have a shred of credibility, but they don't.   I'm not adopted, but I bet its much easier to have the bird and the bees talk, for example, with an adoptive gay parent - of either gender, than it is to have that talk with the manager of the adoption facility.   I think gays have every bit the potential to be amazing parents that straights do.

"Gay people should get their own thing? I agree. In support, can anyone provide a very good reason as to why black people should have gotten their own kind of marriage? That is also what you liberals would call an ""arbitrary"" or ""capricious"" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should ""get their own thing"". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and ""new"" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G ""Great"" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts. Suckers! Shoulda hired better lawyers, you Mixers!  Oh wait, we're talking about those gay people. Yeah, suckers, you Civil Unioners. I won't call you by your real name, but you know what name I'm thinking for you when I think of you... you non-marriage Unioners!

"""As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented.""

Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8."" I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.  And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.   ""What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority.""   You mean, just like interracial marriage?

""Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!""

I don't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same-sex marriage.

The protection of marriage is about protecting the definition of marriage by law. So it's not a question of gay people being oppressed.   So ""gay marriage"" does exist in some states.

Gay or straight sex is not the issue, it is whether or not you use condoms. And speaking of your beloved bible, although you may not be Catholic, the pope's recent statement that condoms do not work and make the aids epidemic worse is going to directly cause the deaths of thousands of people.",1

"I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on   - less so than any of the other civil rights battles that have ever been fought - when it comes to equal access to the ballot, the opponents could at least say their votes would be diluted by expanding the pool of voters - in this case the rights of the opponents will not be diminished in the slightest.    I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights   do you believe each state should have the right not to recognize any marriage - for instance the states that had laws prohibiting interracial marriages?    the word marriage has a religious aspect to it    Actually, I would contend that this is a very widespread misconception. Marriage is actually just a social arrangement. Many religions have tenets related to marriage, but marriage can exist completely outside of religion. The government doesn’t (and shouldn’t) use any religions rules as the arbiter of what is acceptable in terms of marriage (we do not have laws requiring dowery, or that fathers of wife’s who could not prove their virginity pay the husband 50 sheckles, or that wives obey their husband as if he is god, etc.) We take our morals and our common sense and our constitution and some to a consensus on what should be legal – e.g. we allow divorce for more than just adultery because we found practical cases for divorce other than adultery (spousal abuse, etc.)    Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so   The right to be treated equally under the law is already being denied. Equality isn’t being denied because people are talking about it – it is certainly the opposite.    If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again   Equality under law is more than just a piece of paper – social security benefits, health care, tax and court treatment, etc. – gays are taxed equally but receive less in government benefits than heterosexuals.",1

I can't claim to know any reasons why younger siblings are more likely to be gay, unfortunately.",1

How about this put yourself in their shoes how would you like it if you were in love with the same sex and you 2 decide to get married but you couldn't then what? You would be pretty mad wouldn't you? I know that I would. So to me I think they should be able to get married. That's just the way that I see things though.,1
"Homosexuality is legalized voyeurism, thus making homosexuals more equal than others. Homosexuality is not an Identity, but more resembles Dissociative Identity Disorder without the memory lost. Once you have the ability to change your sexual orientation as has been proven in our recent past (gays becoming straight and vicei versa) it's a choice. If Africans had that choice during the time of slavery Jim Crow laws would have been obsolete. The logical conclusion to address the imbalance to our society would to institutionalize unisex toilets. This would open the doorway for sexual deviants to molest your children and womenfolk with their eyes once they don't touch. I was once told that in a perfect world unisex toilets would be fine, but our society isn’t. Nature, Nurture, Genes or Hormones, we were given two (2) boxes, male and female and 99% of us have been equipped to know where we belong. Thus we need to have the self-control and discipline to stay in those boxes. If you need help to bridge the gap between what you ought to do and what you are doing, welcome to the human race.

differences are  likely  to have been  parameters  likely  to  in a group of  90  volunteers  Just a quick glance at 'the most compelling evidence' shows it's nothing really that stable.  But atleast it shows they agree with me.  Gays are basically women with cocks.,0
"""That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out.""  Lol, see again, I am flabbergasted that it is impossible for you to accept that someone might have an opinion different from yours.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  One example of society telling someone they're gay? You! You just did! To Joe. If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.  ""Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?""  African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not. The fact that some nut-case has murdered a gay person before does not make everyone who believes homosexuality is wrong into a murderer. Are you in fear for your life often? If so I am sad, but I sort of doubt it, that's just not the way the world is anymore (in this country). Are you afraid to express your opinion about this topic? I doubt it. I am. If I tell people what I think, I LOSE MY JOB. That's why I post here anonymously :)  ""The Mormon and catholic churches, but especially the Mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right""  Marrying members of the same sex is not a human right. Sorry. Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this. As far as the donations go, the Mormon church DID NOT DONATE A DIME. Neither did the Catholic church (I think, I'm not positive about them). MEMBERS of these churches donated to a cause they believed was right. They have the right.  I have no problem with protests. I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them). I was opposed to it when the homosexuality was attacked and mocked and derided; I oppose it now when they do the same thing to their enemies.",0
"I'm pretty sure you didn't understand my point, so allow me to explain myself. Homosexuality is found throughout nature, in numerous species. Therefore, calling homosexuality unnatural would be misleading (at the very least).  You are correct that we do not have the same genes as fish. But as I said earlier, homosexuality is prevalent in nature, and therefore must be genetic in all of the species I named (including many mammals, and some primates). Therefore if humans were not born homosexual, then this would make our species an exception.  None of this matters however, because we have studied humans, and homosexuality is  not  a choice. It has to do with a combination of genetics, and hormone levels in the womb.",1
"For those who are against same-sex marriage, I dare you to give one RATIONAL reason why it shouldn't be allowed. Without brawling biblical recitings.  If you say they can't because you say ""It was not adam and steve"", you have no point. Adam and eve were not married at the first place. So the fact that they were a male and a female, is a worthless point. It has nothing to do with marriage. If you believe in that story, consider that they have 2 sons, and still they are the beginning of mankind. Hallo incest!  I myself don't believe in the bible, so I don't care what it says anyways.  If you start brawling about Leviticus, you should think then that, in god's opinion, all sins are equal. In the bible, eating shrimps is a sin...  If you say that it shouldn't be allowed because they can't produce any offspring, you have no point either. If you claim that, well you should also forbid straight marriages with no offspring... I think gay marriages would let the divorce-rates go down, what about that then.  There is scientific proof, some animals have a gay lifestyle. And animals don't have a conscience or can't reason. Therefor being gay isn't a choice.   I truly believe that marriage is about love en caring between two loving beings. If they can express that, they should be married. No one could stand in their way with a rational reason.  And I am sure that evolution will ensure that close-mindness will be abandoned.",1

"Procreation is not the reason most people have sex most of the time, very rarely is it so. What is the logical reason when heterosexual couples use condoms?   Emotion and Logic are not distinct. Logic builds off of Emotion, our reasoning is basically preemptively applied Emotional evaluation. For example, as a young child we touch the red coils of a electric stove; we associate that experience with the emotional response and though our reasoning when we see something glowing we think that its likely hot by inductive generalization. With out emotion we would have nothing stopping us from touching the next red glowing thing we see and our hands would be very burnt. Emotionally, we don't like pain.   One of my oldest friends is gay; if he one day wants the legal rights granted by marriage; he should be able to have them even if the other consenting adult in the contract is male. Personally I wouldn't mind marriage being abolished, perhaps replaced with a contract that legally incorporates someone into your family, without the religious and sexual undertones of marriage. Marriage IS NOT a religious thing, its a legal thing; ifs its religious then government needs to stop recognizing marriage and view it as a private religious practice.",1

"That you operate outside social norms you are classified as a Deviant. Your anus or a plastic/steel/wooden rod is not a sexual organ; therefore using them in a sexual act should be considered abnormal, shouldn't it? Having anal sex is like trying to eat food with your eyes (it just was not design for that). The normal curve is used in all fields of studies to classify what is acceptable and what's not. It also determines when mechanical plants are to be changed, unearths systematic errors and blunders. Of special concern are systematic errors, which are frequently caused by miscalibration. This error in a system also produces normal curve, but skewed. Thus, shifting the goal post thereby making previously deviance behaviour acceptable. That’s why you (ChadOnSunday221) can no longer see that gay marriages are immoral and unethical; it was a slide of hands. Attempting to make us believe that homosexuality is an identity and not a choice was the tactical manoeuvre. Where will this post be in the future, who knows? Chad we may wake up one morning a discover that rape, child porn, sex with animals, lowered age of consent, etc. are now social norms.",0
"Your ""consenting adults"" requirement doesn't hold water because that can be legally changed as well. In the old days the age of consent was much lower.  The point that I'm trying to make however is that the best definition of marriage is exactly what it currently is because it is very specific. The whole purpose of language is to add clarity, not to obfuscate the issue. If you want a word to mean the union of two human beings, then come up with one. Don't obfuscate the language.",0
"In order to oppose gay couples being able to adopt you have to prove beyond any doubt that it causes long term harm to the child. Otherwise there is really no grounds on which to stand against this.  In fact I know many Christians who believe homosexuality is wrong that don't oppose gay adoption. It actually provides an increase in the demand for adoptions, which lowers the number of abortions performed. Win-Win!",1
"There you go again. I disagree with you, so i'm a bigot. If someone thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a bigot, what does that make them? (I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)  The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.  Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances.   I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.  1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.  2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.  I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.  I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower).",0

You make a point against gay marriage by claiming that it would inevitably lead to man-dog marriage or daughter-mother (gay AND incest) which is wrong. There is no logic behind this reasoning. The question is whether gay marriage should be allowed for the gays to benefit from exactly the reasons you claim you have no problem with(insurance and inheritance).

There are many untraditional families who make it work. Just because they don't have to body parts you find fit, doesn't mean they can't raise children.

There's also no evidence linking homosexuality with pederasty. There is no evidence to link gay households with problem children. Sorry, you're full of shit.  3.

"OK, I'll go on record. homosexuality is  not  a choice.  Having said that, I disagree with any court that claims marriage is a right anymore than driving a car is a right.  When I say something is ""a right"" I mean a God given right. For example, the right to pursue happiness. Gays are free to pursue happiness. Freedom is another right. Gays are free.  The U.S. cannot tell me who I can and cannot marry because I am the one who decides who to marry. The U.S. may not recognize my marriage but that doesn't impede on my decision (who to marry) nor does it impede my happiness. The only thing it impedes is any benefits I would be eligible for if the U.S. recognized my marriage.   A country has a right to decide what it will or will not recognize. The decision as to what it will or will not recognize is based on the majority. Anything else is just the tail waging the dog. A situation where the minority rules the majority and that is not right.  During the American Civil War, both sides had roughly the same number of people. Enough to sustain the war for 4 years. If one side had had more troops than the other, the war would have ended much quicker.   Eventually the side against slavery won. Eventually the North had enough people on its side to constitute a majority and end slavery. Slavery did not come to an end because it was immoral. Slavery came to an end because  the majority  did not want slavery.  Same thing with suffrage. Women did not get the right to vote because it was the right thing to do. Women got the right to vote because the majority of the people wanted it.  Currently, the majority of the people do not want gay marriage. If they did, gay marriage would be legal. I expect that to change in the near future. Any attempt to force the majority into some thing it clearly does not want is wrong.  The supreme court handed down their ruling. And yet, it is not the law of the land. Why? Because the majority does not want it. The supreme court's decision (without the sanction of the majority) is moot.  Now, you can go and fly in the face of reality and scream and shout, ""But the supreme court said...."" and you still wouldn't get any further than you are today. I, on the other hand, recognize reality for what it is and proposed an alternate solution around the problem. A solution that you said gay groups are pursuing.  So, you can dispute me all you want. It wont change a thing. Marriage will only become a right when the majority sees it that way. Until then, it is not a right. Regardless of what the supreme court says.    You can't legislate morality.",0

These laws apply equally to all, so equal protection isn't violated (I'm sorry, you have just as much a right to marry a member of the opposite sex as anyone else). If you don't like it, you vote to change the laws.  That's democracy. It's not perfect, but it's the best thing out there!  Oh, and it's not the same as civil rights, and if I was black I would be horribly offended by such a comparison. They were fighting for basic human rights which had been denied them. They were being killed, and denied work opportunities and the right to vote. Homosexual's aren't being denied anything (that isn't already denied to everyone else in the country). They just aren't getting what they want.",0

Secondly, people do NOT choose to be gay, scientific evidence shows that people are born GAY, would you not allow a person with dyslexia or downs syndrome to marry? They are born different to us.

"Well, segregation is kind of a bad word   There's nothing bad about it.   Marriage is in most places, defined as a man and a woman. So the best thing to do is create civil unions. It's really simple actually.   An implication of Brown vs the Board of Education, and subsequent integration laws, permitted precedent for Lovings vs Virginia as an addendum to Brown, amending the definition of marriage, institutionally, to include interracial coupling, as a matter of civil rights. Your point, as simple as it is, holds no weight. Lovings vs Virginia effectively trumps you.   Why does a different name make something un-equal?   You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal. If people are on equal ground, then segregating their practices and institutions contradicts that equity. If they are equal, then there's no reason at all to segregate.",1
"Ah, yes. ReventonRage did pointed out a contradiction. However, both of you and him is forgetting the point. The point is that in one perspective or sense, it is wrong to be a homosexual. And in another sense, it is right to be a homosexual. I gave the reason why.   The truth can be contradicting but it doesn't mean that it isn't the truth.  I believe another point that you two are forgetting that there is a right and a wrong to every side. Being a homosexual is naturally right and wrong. Being a non-homosexual (straight male and female) can be both right and wrong.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   This is one sense in which being a homosexual is right. You must had implied that i implied that this is the only way that they are right. No. Another way to advance as humans is education. Homosexuals can become teacher, scientists, mathmaticians, etc. I didn't pointed it out because i wanted to provide a short but simple comment to Apollo.    This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.   I should been more clearer. In many senses, a non-homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race. A homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race.   It is contradicting but this is still the truth.  Edit. Homosexuals are wrong because they stop the world from populating. Homosexuals are right because they stop overpopulation. Those are two contradicting but truthful statements. In a ""sense"" if one person can't produce an offspring, he or she is opposing the purpose of life in ONE WAY. In another ways, he or she can support it. Hence people can be both right and wrong. Not producing an offsprings opposes the purpose of life by not increasing your own race in numbers.   In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D",1

"OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.  ""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""   http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/ bornorbred.pdf   a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  ""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  ""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""  I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)",0

"Here is why I disagree. In Arkansas, their was a law passed that banned people from adopting who were living with a sexual partner who they were not married to. This law had no other purpose then to stop homosexuals from adopting children. Right now Arkansas has more then three times more children that need adoption then there are available families to take them in, but guess what? Apparently taking away rights from homosexuals is more important. There is absolutely no proof that children who grow up in homosexual households suffer any sort of added mental problems. In fact, a court in Arkansas had  unanimously  agreed to overturn a ban on gay couples becoming foster parents because the reasons stated were, to be frank, bullshit.  The only way that we can fight homophobia is by showing people that homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight couples. I know you say yo don't hate gays, but why do you oppose gay marriage? Don't homosexuals deserve the right to have their love legally recognized? And don't say that there should be civil unions, that's the same thing telling African Americans they can drink from a water fountain, but not the same one as whites. Separate but equal can never be equal.",1
"It's one thing for gay couples to adopt their own lifestyle, but they've moved far beyond that. Now they are demanding that the rest of society change its traditions and institutions to suit them.

I can gather up more than a few homosexuals and a few non homosexuals, put them in a house, and make an experiment out of it. People can say that the scenario is pointless because it never has occured in society before. And i say bravo because that proves that homosexuality is wrong in that sense.

How was my scenario false accusation? How was my scenario irrational? Oh, Thank you. You admitted that my scenario was irrational. Irrational is a term that means illogical or NOT REASONABLE.

"Would you have said this in 1967 prior to Loving v. Virginia?  ""Interracial marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.  The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is itself an attack on the traditional meaning of the word ""marriage"". The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.  Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.  A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.  The new practice of what may be called a ""heteroracial union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.  In particular, the practice of calling this ""interracial marriage"" does harm both to the word ""interracial"", and to the word ""marriage"", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""interracial"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""miscegenation""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.  It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.  In conclusion, the phrase ""interracial marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word ""marriage"" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be ""heteroracial union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"". Finally, by unequivocating the meaning of the words used, much unnecessary disagreement and wasted debate could be avoided.""  There is a difference between harm and progress.",1

"The point is that either one is not fixed. Laws can and have been changed, just like definitions. You are making an appeal to a standard that in the final analysis is no standard.   So my real point in all this is: If there is no transcendent; then all we are left with is personal opinions and might makes right (survival of the fittest)  Remember those lines from the Deceleration of Independence;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights   They got it right.

"It seems that the only real argument against gay marriage is because the bible says it is wrong. That is your personal belief and your personal opinion, don't force it on to others. The bible says homosexuality is a sin and you extend this to say that gay marriage should not be allowed. Fine, don't get married to someone of the same gender as you.  No one's forcing you to marry someone of the same gender. If your personal belief system tells you that it is wrong then fine, don't have same-sex partners. That doesn't mean you need to go around inflicting your dogma onto the general population.   Now, you cannot possibly say that it is immoral and then quote the bible.  Blind obedience to ancient texts is about as far away from morality as you can get.  The bible isn't a moral code just because it holds conservative view points.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------     If the bible really was a source of infallible morals, then it should be perfectly moral to:    Sell one's daughters as sex slaves  (Exodus 21:7-11)   Kill adulterers  (Leviticus 20:10)   Kill blasphemers  (Leviticus 24:10-16)   Rape women  (Isaiah 13:15-18)   Kill women, babies and children  (Isaiah 14:21), (Hosea 9:11-16), (Ezekiel 9:5-7), (Exodus 12:29-30), (Isaiah 13:15-18).    --------------------------------------- ----------------------    Morality should be something which can be discussed with reason, logic and evidence. There is no logical reason why homosexuality is wrong. By denying homosexuals the right to marry you are creating a second class of people; you are discriminating against them by saying that they are not worthy of long-term, legally recognised relationships, yet heterosexuals are.",1

You can get married without the religious ritual. But you can't get married without a state license.

"So let me get this straight. As long as a majority of people oppose someone else's right to something they themselves enjoy, that wronged person has to wait until the majority get with the program, and then and only then, does he get to enjoy what everyone else is enjoying? Huh?   The religious right can and do believe anything they want, no matter how stupid and obnoxious and irrational it is. They can and do teach their kids whatever nonsense they care to.  My right to equal protection under the law - my right to enjoy the same tax breaks, visitation rights, and property inheritance rights everyone else has - does not in any way interfere with that. How do you conceivably justify this denial of my rights under the same constitution and under the same tax code, with whatever minor challenge to someone's religious beliefs there could possibly be?  This is like denying rights to African Americans or Hispanics because the KKK has issues with it. That wouldn't stand for a second. Why am I any different?  No one is challenging any one's right to their beliefs here. But as a taxpaying American, I most certainly DO demand the same rights as you enjoy.  Let's be perfectly straight here: no one is asking a church to perform a same sex wedding. Most people who are gay wouldn't step foot in a church to begin with because there is so much hate there. As Ghandi said, ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. They are so much unlike him.""  There are plenty of Christian churches that love and accept us that no one would ever bother for one moment thinking about going into one of the palaces of hate that so many churches have become. So how in heaven's name does that interfere with your religion?  My own Episcopalian church couldn't possibly be a more warm and inviting place for gay and lesbian people. I love it there.

It amuses me that you didn't even look 4 lines higher, at 20:9 when you were demonstrating how well you know the bible.   ""For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.""  Murder everyone, even small children, that has ever cursed at their parents? That would require the deaths of millions of 10 year olds. I assume you don't believe this. This is in fact said in the very same speech that your quote comes from.   We can even go all the way down to 20:18, where it clearly states that having sex with your wife while she is menstruating should be met with exile. Seems a little harsh considering it is possible for it to start during sex.   Then it states things that have been dis-proven. ""If a man shall lie with his uncle's wife ... they shall die childless."" (20:20), so even if you have shady morals regarding periods and child murder, you cannot claim that everything in this chapter is true.  All I am trying to say is that you are choosing passages to belief and passages to ignore. Since you cannot reasonably deny that, I would just hope that perhaps you'll start ignoring the bigotry and focusing on the love.",1

"I'd like to know what you define as a ""normal"" mindset. Here's a link to the Child Welfare Information Gateway:  http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/f_gay/ f_gayb.cfm    Children get teased for many reasons. ""Gay and lesbian parents are well aware of the difficulties that a child may face - many have dealt with prejudice all of their lives. Most see it as an opportunity for ongoing discussion that will help their children grow as people.""  According to studies, ""Wendell Ricketts and Roberta Achtenberg, in the article ""Adoption and Foster Parenting for Lesbians and Gay Men: Creating New Traditions in Family"" from Homosexuality and Family Relations, address social workers grappling with the issue by asking, ""...should children be sheltered from every experience in which their difference might challenge prejudice, ignorance, or the status quo (or in which they would be 'exposed' to the difference of others)? Agencies conforming to such a standard must ask themselves whether it is their function to honor the system that generates stigma by upholding its constraints."" They continue, ""Teasing is what children do. Does this mean that child welfare policy must be set at a level no higher than the social interactions of children?""  ""The bulk of evidence to date indicates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to become homosexual than children raised by heterosexuals. As one researcher put it, ""If heterosexual parenting is insufficient to ensure that children will also be heterosexual, then there is no reason to conclude that children of homosexuals also will be gay"". 11  ""Studies asking the children of gay fathers to express their sexual orientation showed the majority of children to be heterosexual, with the proportion of gay offspring similar to that of a random sample of the population. An assessment of more than 300 children born to gay or lesbian parents in 12 different samples shows no evidence of ""significant disturbances of any kind in the development of sexual identity among these individuals"". 12   ""Courts have expressed concern that children raised by gay and lesbian parents may have difficulties with their personal and psychological development, self-esteem, and social and peer relationships. Because of this concern, researchers have focused on children's development in gay and lesbian families.  The studies conclude that children of gay or lesbian parents are no different than their counterparts raised by heterosexual parents. In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""  Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation. A parent's capacity to be respectful and supportive of the child's autonomy and to maintain her own intimate attachments, far outweighs the influence of the parent's sexual orientation alone.""",1
Agreed. I personally think state governments should not be able to grant marriages and should only be able to grant civil unions to everyone. Marriages are too religious. The next best alternative is to allow gay marriage. But I agree that marriage does violate the constitution especially if religious reasons are used to bar certain people from entering marriages.,1
"That's perfectly reasonable, unless you're attracted to woman. For people who are attracted to the same sex and are religious, it causes them a lot of unnecessary distress. I assume that isn't the case for you though, so that is a perfectly good system.  The bible says a lot of crazy things, that's why most Christians don't read it.",1

What I can argue is that what finally allowed blacks to use the same bathrooms and school as  equals  was educating the next generation. You can't legislate morality. Just because they made a law that allowed blacks to use the same bathroom and schools as whites did not create an atmosphere where blacks were all of a sudden, magically, accepted as equals.

"What constitutes a pathology? And how does a mental pathology differ from an organic pathology? The DSM in some ways is not only a diagnostic instrument; it is a research tool in which clinicians systematically identify areas of concern in patients lives related to mental functioning, and this is a relationship that cannot be easily detached in theory or reality. Some of these broad categories, then, are just that -- they are useful analytical tools, but they are not necessarily 1:1::theory:reality the same thing as a real disease. We may find one day (assuming this example for the argument) that Autism is not one disease but multiple, perhaps independent, ""pathogenic"" sources affecting a conglomeration of people who (1) meet the classification due to mostly environmental reasons such as metal poisoning, or (2) meet the classification generally due to a biological reason with both a genetic and environmental cofactor, and perhaps (3) some amount of people who simply represent the statistical extremes of normal human variation. The above example is dry, but the implications are important to what you are saying, because you take the DSM as a supreme way of describing expert opinion on what is pathological (except for when it is corrupted by politicians), when the DSM doubles both as a clinical tool and a research tool.  Also, if you don't trust the DSM IV-TR of current time (because of political powers interfering with the DSM revision process), and you also now believe that research material can be politically influenced (it's fair to say it can, though we must also be concerned with scope and magnitude), what research material are you going to have us trust that also coincidentally supports your argument about how homosexuality is pathological?  Do you anticipate a reversing trend in psychological and medical journals where authors are persuaded that homosexuality is a pathology?",1

"This is a legal issue, not a mathematical one.  Separate but equal is a legal doctrine in United States Constitutional law that justified systems of segregation.

It is a technical term in Geography which refers to ""the idea that any given environment can only support a finite population.""   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one.   This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable   It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   No, I didn't. The only reason why you say so is because you an obstinate fool.   But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong.   Which is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   You  are  wrong. Something cannot be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.   Hey idiot, you  did  mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.",1
I personally dont agree with the gay marriage situation but i do believe that this is a free country and they have as much of a right to get married as any straight couple. They can love each other just as much as a straight couple. Everyone has a right to their own opinion and beliefs. We as a country should not have the right to tell someone if they can get married or not just because of the way someone lives.,1
"Whatever Jake, it's very easy to lie and be a bigot and a fundie, especially over internet.  Approximately 80% of homophobes are gay and I'm SURE the rest have their issues too, mostly connected with sexuality.  If you think that a person would turn gay if he was allowed to, than you must be thinking of a person who is attracted to men, you are referring to a GAY person and a GAY person turning GAY ISN'T VERY DRAMATIC, NOW IS IT?!  An intelligent straight person would never like it to not allow gays to marry and adopt children.  If gays can marry and adopt that means that baby making isn't a very big deal since the gays are going to raise them. (If you are a religions fundie, that means you can be more logically for pro-life if you are pro-gay-marriage)  Plus, if there are so many women left alone, or rather lonely, than you can have a lot of sex.  Oh, and by the way, straight men like sex with women (right guys? :)), so they couldn't mind.  The only people who could POSSIBLY mind gays are gay people who don't want to be gay(...and raise kids and miss all the coitus..., but they don't like it anyway) and women who fall in love with gays. As some comedian woman says: ""I'm a fag-hag, but now I think about my wishing in youth about being surrounded by handsome men, I should have been more specific.""",1
"This is a brilliant statement, and I have to agree with you on this.  I'm straight and currently have no defined religion (only one born of personal beliefs that has no name) but I don't see the problem with same sex marriage.

Gay marriage isn't exactly killing anyone, people should put their effort into issues that actually matter instead of denying happy couples their right to be legally married.",1

But you need to open your mind and understand that  there is nothing wrong with being gay!   And again, the bible is not meant to be applied to law. So YES, gays should adopt.  And what is a family to you?  Family is an ambiguous word these days. I hope you don't have that picturesque little household with a white picket fence, with a mom and dad, and a Golden Retriever who brings in the paper, et cetera... because  that  would be weird.  It's a matter of perception. And I have to tell you that other than biblical references, there is no excuse for thinking being gay is wrong. Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children. They aren't retarded. They understand the world, and the people in it. And they have love to give, and can create a stable environment for a child just as well as a straight couple.  Every difference is trivial.",1

"OK, so let me say back to you what I understood you say. A group of people (who hate gays) successfully figured out a way to either circumvent, or navigate thought, the system. Now, isn't that what I'm telling gays to do?  But more importantly, lets say that you are 100 % correct and that the law sacrificed unmarried heterosexuals in order to strike back at homosexuals. I think that you would agree that this would be a very spiteful and hateful thing to do. Now, are you telling me that you want to try and change those people's mind and remain living there. Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that just because a law is passed that people all of the sudden are going to change their mind and stop hating you? And you really want to keep living there? Knowing that you are hated and despised for forcing something down their throats? Something they didn't want? Let me see.... what is it that some white people do when ""undesirables"" move into their neighborhoods? Who benefits? Which is the best course of action to take?",0

Older generations were mind-fucked into believing many things were ""OK"" such as slavery and even after that was abolished racism was practiced in many households. as I'm sure after Gay marriage is legal there will be many homophobic households. Its like someones Dad being a racist and 20 years down the line they find themselves spurting a racist comment and catch themselves not even believing their own words. It was forced into their young minds. Younger generations have been increasingly allowed to explore their OWN beliefs the result of which is increased support for things that older generations were protecting out of tradition.

Take the Gandhi road, the Martin Luther king road instead of the low road that may get you there faster. Don't take the ""If you are against us you are "" road. The low road is a tactic used to get you there faster.  If I recall correctly, I did not compare homosexuals to Nazis. I said that the tactics being used are the same tactics that the Nazis used. This tactic can be used for good. The tactic itself is not evil. The gay movement is not the first to use that tactic. I don't like the tactic.  I think that calling  everyone  who is opposed to gay marriage a bigot is unfair and narrow minded.  When I said, ""gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?""

I am not against homosexuals at all but I think marriage should be reserved for man and woman. Many people I know agree they don't want their children to see two homosexuals holding hands and making out in the middle of the street so that their children think it is alright and (if religious) God intended that. Unless the marriage is not at a church and there's no religion involved I don't think it is right. I'm okay with them just signing papers though. I believe it does hurt people because as my first example said many straight parents don't want their children thinking such a thing is natural and it also strongly disturbs some people.,0

There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts.

"The Bible considers homosexuality to be morally incorrect, and thus a sin.  Leviticus 20:13: If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.  Romans 1:27: Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  1 Corinthians 6:9: Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders",0

"Historically marriage is a property arrangement wherein a man takes possession of a woman. This has led to forced marriages and polygamy being the norm for thousands of years up to this day in many parts of the world. What you call marriage is a western idea. Western society has changed the definition of marriage a lot to suit their society just like any society does. Considering womena's sufferge wasn't that long ago as far as history is concerned it's suprising that you think marriage has always been a equal union. No, actually it's naive.  On your point about blacks: They had to be allowed equal protection under the law before that could happen. Google: Jim Crow.  The racist were upholding the traditional norm that blacks were subhuman and shouldn't marry whites. You just don't seem to get it. People thought marriage didn't include them at the time either. You are looking at the whole thing backwards. The word is changed constantly through history and those against the change are always on the wrong side of it.",1
"What are friends for? Not that kind of relationship. If I am attracted to a female then I can't help it. And I don't think friends are meant for that intimacy.  Same-sex isn't for marriage because people can't get over themselves. If people want to live together in love than no one else should be able to stop them. Regardless of color, sex, or any other factor that people can't control.",1
"Giving benefits to gay partners will make being gay a more acceptable alternative. It is acceptable to to be nice to people who are really gay, while also trying to prevent it from becoming just another option for people to experiment with. Is it acceptable to try to promote a mother and a father as the preference, and is withholding all the same benefits of marriage a valid way to try to show societies preference for families with mothers and fathers? Obviously gay people have a right to live how they want. You can't be mean to them. You can't discriminate against them in any way as far as career, housing, etc... but if the majority wants to show a preference... So people the belief is that more people will be hurt by experimenting with their sexuality, than if they would have just assumed they were straight. Sure, if you KNOW you are gay, go for it, but let the rest of us sort of ignore it.",0
"Personally, I think love is equal, whether is in the form of a man and a woman, a man with a man, or a woman with a woman.  Not to be judgmental, but one Christian belief is that God loves everyone, we are all his children.   Then when you turn on the TV, you see the very same people who believe that God loves everyone start riots about the gay marriage law passed. They keep saying that being homosexual is a sin, and an abomination.   As a wise man once told me: That issue is between that person and God. Its not our job to tell people what they should and shouldn't do with their life. If that person has sinned, then let them take it up with the Lord himself.  I'm not trying to be biased about the Christian faith, just the two things seem to go hand and hand with each other.",1

"You claim that the rights should be given   The same rights given to homosexual couples as to heterosexual couples.   Marriages have benefits.   Well, depending on your definition of ""benefits"" (legal or social), this could be a fact or a debatable opinion.   Your reasoning is extend them to be fair, but that's a fallacy: Why should the state give them costly benifits?   1) How is that a fallacy?  2) YOUR refute is a fallacy, a special pleading fallacy. You ask why the state should give them costly benefits, yet you ignore that the state is giving  hetero sexual couples the same costly benefits that we are arguing over with  homo sexual couples. If you wish to point out why the state should give them costly benefits, you surely need to be fair and ask that about ALL groups that ARE given those costly benefits versus the ones you do not think that should.   So what reason is there to allow them union?   They bring no harm and it's not our place to legislate in the affairs of consenting adults wishing to love when no other harmful factors have been proven. The gay couple down the street does not affect or effect my marriage with my husband and if they were to marry, STILL do not alter my marriage.   None!   You haven't refuted any of my statements.   As my last argument proved the state sees marriage as a procreative type union and therefore the government has no reason to allow it.   And what last argument proves that?  You know what? For the shits and giggles of it all, let's pretend you DID indeed prove that the state sees marriage as a procreative type union; why does the state allow infertile  hetero sexual (straight) couples to marry; this includes the elderly, those who choose a surgery which makes them infertile, those who choose not to have kids and those with a disorder that disallows them the ability for procreation? If marriage is about procreation, these groups should not be allowed to marry as well....",1
"Homosexuality hasn't been considered a disease by most scientists for 50 years by now, and I see no reason why homos shouldn't be allowed to raise children like everyone else.",1
"Firstly:  Gay relationships:  The majority of gay relationships last shorter then 6 months. (1)  Very few gay relationships surpas 2 years. (2)  Only 2.7% of gays have 1 partner throughout their whole life. (3)  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year. (4)  Another said they have 500-1000 throughout their whole life. (5)  Why should these rights be granted?   The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions. (6)  Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail.  Discrimination:  A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship. As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature. (7, 8) Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)   Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just. (7,8) Aristotle saw this as what you deserved, not what is given. (8, 9)    As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal ""right"" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost.

They are human beings that simply prefer same sex partners AND THAT IS OK.",1
"Good so you agree that illicit sex is condemned by hinduism which means homosexuality is condemned.  Glad we got that over with.   What I agree is that the scriptures are open to interpretation by anyone, just because a conventional wisdom points them in a certain way does not indicate their intent. What I was also stating is that they are written by men, in this respect they are flawed.   Oh no! I'm a bigot. I'm so ashamed and terrified. Faggot   That is up to you.   And IM the one in denial.   Maybe you are, maybe you are not, but the matter of the fact is that homosexuals are here to stay, it is your choice to be bothered by them, although I don't see why you would as they are only living out their lives as they wish which is everyone right.   Ohh you're being gay again....   So by pointing out your mistake in the use of a word, I am attracted to people of the same sex, if you are unsure of what a gay person is I would advise checking it out before entering a debate about it.   Homosexuality is immoral since time immemorial   Homosexuality was a part of many ancient civilizations such as, Greece, Rome, China, etc   Homosexuality is condemned by 99% of all religions   Probably true of most modern religions.   Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.   Marriage between heterosexual couples is performed as both a religious and a legal ceremony, Gay couples do not get married in a religious ceremony so why would it bother you? Homosexuals are human the same as heterosexuals, should they not have the same rights?   Homosexuals are gay   If you mean happy then I'm glad for them and wonder why you are not.  If you mean they are homosexuals then there is nothing more to say other than Duuuhhhhh.   You're gay   If you mean happy, yes I am. If you mean homosexual then no I am not, why would you consider me a homosexual? unless your gaydar is going off.",1

So Gay people being themselves are pleasing themselves by making their parent sad when they come out? What? There are more assumptions in this statement than I care to address.   Not all gay people are pleased with being gay due to the society we are in, and to assume all parents hate to hear their kid is gay just completely shows us how twisted your logic is.

"To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is ""only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ""—not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslims—it's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera—oh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.  Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman—it is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)—and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in God—hey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choice—no one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like that—it is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing.   Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame?   ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)  Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religion—the majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words.",0

Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors.

You are right in saying that marriage is between a man and a woman, but only because the word structure necessitates it. And I think we'd live in a boring world if we didn't stretch definitions and rules every now and again.   with one of the main purposes being to procreate and have children,   Find me a single dictionary that says this.   once you take that ability away there is no way it can be a marriage.

"Rights are a human construct, and thus are unnatural.   Rousseau disagrees. Hobbes and Rousseau had this debate roughly 400 years ago. Rousseau's view prevailed. Rights flow from the natural right that everyone has a right to dictate their own destiny. Hence, they're not a human construct.   Hobbes? Was he the writer of Leviathon?   Yes.   Was the chaos and warfare of the middle ages caused by a lack of human rights? Or rather by overbearing monarchs?   Both. Overbearing monarchs infringed on human rights.   How does homosexuality promote peace and order? Greece, Rome - all the homosexual 'hotspots' throughout history have fallen.   Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest.

I think that everyone should be given the chance to care for a child. And it all depends how you best give the proper guidance and love for your children. But I am not still favor of gays adopting a child. Child should be well-guided and be nurture and I believe that only a legitimate couple complete with a mom and dad could only provide this. There are studies that children with no father image at home tend to engage more into drugs and other things. This is also the same case if mom is not around. I believe this could be worsen if you are reared by parents who has the same gender.,1
"Homosexuals hurt the idea of family morales, what if they were to adopt a kid, and all of his/her friends ask why they have 2dads, or 2 moms. The kids dont know, and honestly, so do I. I dont really care if there are gay people and they do there freaky stuff in their private life, but getting married is too much. And i agree with soccerstud, there are two sexes on this planet for a reason, if god wanted us to be gay then he would have only created one sex. Plus, you need 2 different sexes to make a normal family work, you need breast milk, you need sperm cells, you need egg cell, you need both the female and the male to function as a normal family, and in my opinion, gay married couples are not a normall functioning family.",0

Should we really discriminate against people who are the same as us but just like their same gender romantically?",1
"Which obviously makes no sense as a statement at all since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   lol it totally makes sense. Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth. If what you believe is the actual truth, then your belief is truth. By definiton, belief and knowledge differs. By mental thinking alone, belief and knowledge is the same when belief is knowledge.    Wrong. It is an opinion that has not been proven to be true or false.   By definition alone, yes. By mental thinking, no. Think about it. Beliefs MAY be true or false.    Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"". Population growth exceeds ""the normal amount"" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there is overpopulation. Population growth might lead to overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation immediately. Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I know that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.   No, i do understand that and i had implied that. I should had stated that but i didn't. But you hadn't stated it either before. You too stated that overpopulation means that the population exceeds the normal amount.    Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   No, it doesn't make it wrong. It makes it pointless.    Since you claimed that it is ""mostly female homosexuals"", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   I did justify your claim. The fact that you would even ask that in the argument that im responding proves that you are not reading my argument entirely.    I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I know that you don't want to change the scenario. And you are not showing how it is wrong. That is illogical speaking because simply that doesn't make sense. I created a scenario of a society with mostly homosexual females. Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.    Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a FALSE ANALOGY and you haven't disputed me.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me. You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).    Which is ontologically wrong.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong. In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.    Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.   Now you are being ignorant. My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong. I told two or three times that i went into this discussion because i implied marriage as producing children and that is why i went into the purpose of life. The reason why i still went into this discussion is because you are still replying me.   I replied to your criticism. I remember asking you countless questions that you never answered. And you haven't disprove my scenarios.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends. If society wants to continue for centuries, homosexuals need to bear children. Im ignoring the fact that you can adopt children.   If society is fearing overpopulation, homosexuals is beneficials by controlling the overpopulation rate. They are not the only source to stop population. They are just one way.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.",0
"Everyone that is not hurting anyone else has the right to pursue their goals in life, and the things that make them happy.   Says who? There is no written protection anywhere in the constitution saying so. It can be inferred, perhaps, but it is not a guaranteed right. As such, the majority can vote on this issue any way they like until the constitution is changed in a legal fashion (i.e. the legislative branch).  Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony,   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist.   it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder? Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?",0
Well IF science 'says' that your fate is decided at birth then I'm going to say it how it is.  Bullshit.  Science only points to an increase likelyhood of being gay. Never 100% definately going to be a cocksucker. A lot of the general 'science' is flawed and sometimes doesn't even give cause.  Sexuality isn't predetermined at birth. Anybody who says so is just trying to give gays a free pass. We should start doing that with criminals. Ohh wait they are.....,0
"So I've been reading these points by all and I think we really need to step back and take a ""chill pill"" :) Opposing gay marriage doesn't mean we're ""homophobic"" or hate gays, so let's keep the ad homonym attacks to a minimum. I am opposed to gay marriage for a couple of very specific reasons, but I am in the theater business and of about 30 guys who are my close friends, 29 of them are probably gay, and I love them like crazy!  So again I want to say that, to use the debates words (although I think they are a little inflammatory), gay marriage does hurt everyone for the following reason: The prominent justification for gay marriage is that it is a right and that denying it will take away the rights of a minority, similar to the civil rights movement. Using this justification, any religious group that denies gays participation or clergy or marriage will be branded as persecuting homosexuals. The scary thing is that there are some people reading this right now and thinking ""yes, that would be discrimination and homophobia and should be stopped."" I just read a quote:  'Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor and gay activist who helps draft federal legislation related to sexual orientation, says that, when religious liberty conflicts with gay rights, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”'  http://article.nationalreview.com/ ?q=YTU5MjZmMDIyMDU3NjRiMjBlNjcxYTlmOGQ2 ODA5NjA=   (an altogether fetching article which says this entire thing much better than I have)  Gay marriage is an immediate threat to our freedoms AS IT IS CURRENTLY being pursued. The owners of eharmony.com are REQUIRED to provide gay matchmaking. They have no freedom to do otherwise. Doctors who provide in vitro fertilization are REQUIRED to do it for lesbian couples, even if this is against their beliefs. These doctors have lost their freedom.  Now gay marriage DOESN'T have to be this way. Pass legal laws which respect the beliefs of others. As I said, i love my gay friends, and I might be ok with some of them marrying (I say might because of all of these people, I can think of only one couple that even pretends to be serious about their relationship, and I think they are adorable! The others shouldn't marry imo, whether they are gay or straight or anything because they aren't serious, but that's just my opinion and it's honestly none of my business :). So as i said, go ahead and pass the laws, but don't take away the rights of others to believe that homosexuality is wrong, because THAT is what is against the constitution.",0

"In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids.   Marriage normally doesn't produce children. Sex does, specifically.   Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report   The report in the PDF file only argues the importance of the institution of marriage to the general welfare of the population.

"Obama may have been right to do it, but Bush wasn't a really bad guy for not having done it.

Gays can still live how the want, but they can't force the majority to like it, or accept them, and little laws that don't grant full equality are not fundamental humal liberty issues, we have to draw the line somewhere, and no one would want to legalize bestiality or polygamy, and so we all draw the lines slightly different locations, and it is not worth throwing a hissy fit over...

So to summarize, Gay marriage does hurt us. It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion. I vote against Gay marriage and I vote against ANY form of marriage where two people must register their union with the government.  Our forefathers fought against the stamp tax, yet 240 years later the constitution has been raped and the very laws we fought against have been slowly yoked around our necks.",0

"Guess what? Marriage is a ""civil union"".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of ""civil"" in this situation is ""of or pertaining to civil law"". Civil law is ""the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters.""  One definition of ""union"" is ""the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage"". As I said, marriage is a civil union.   So people who want gays to be able to form civil unions are in effect supporting gay marriage.  However same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.   When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benfits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marrige be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in an illegal way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".",1
I don't know if you've noticed but over the last years most churches have been more and more tolerant of gay people and accept them as any other member...just like regular people.

Morality constrains us, it qualifies right and wrong, it not alien to us it's built-in, coded, programming into our humanity. The concept of the original position is based upon this inalienable human trait. Moralism (which we both obviously hate) is a bully, it attempts to devour and threaten others.

"Ok now, and read my whole argument and read it twice befroe you comment; gay, CHRISTIAN marriages should not be allowed.   By bringing this issue to the courts, the homosexual community is forcing a rule onto a private group! it is written in the christian rule set (of any form or branch of the following of Jehovah (Yes, that is His name), including Catholics, Jews, Mormans, ect.) that the bond of two souls of the same sex is unnatural, and as such is immoral. So here remains the issue; the Christians are upset because the homosexual community is FORCING, and not just by judicial means, their beliefs of unity onto another private party. It is written by the way in the most used from of the bible that it is an absolute sin to propose, follow threw, or allow a marriage of the same two sex's.   Keep in mind that i am not christian, but follow a similar religion that, while against the order of unnatural ethics, am for the furthering of the bondage of souls, and also believe that every soul finds it's way into each beast and its sex's.

"Should your state decide if YOU can marry who you want? Did the Supreme Court go too far when it overruled state's laws against interracial marriages in 1967?

And if a gay couple adopts a child in a state where gay adoption is legal then moves to (or vacations in, drives through, etc.) a state where gay adoption is illegal, are there custody rights put in question?  Or, a lesbian couple who gets a civil union where it is legal, has a child by artificial insemination, and one spouse takes the kid to a state that does not recognize their union (based on a real case), what are the other spouse's rights?

"What constitutes a pathology? And how does a mental pathology differ from an organic pathology? The DSM in some ways is not only a diagnostic instrument; it is a research tool in which clinicians systematically identify areas of concern in patients lives related to mental functioning, and this is a relationship that cannot be easily detached in theory or reality. Some of these broad categories, then, are just that -- they are useful analytical tools, but they are not necessarily 1:1::theory:reality the same thing as a real disease. We may find one day (assuming this example for the argument) that Autism is not one disease but multiple, perhaps independent, ""pathogenic"" sources affecting a conglomeration of people who (1) meet the classification due to mostly environmental reasons such as metal poisoning, or (2) meet the classification generally due to a biological reason with both a genetic and environmental cofactor, and perhaps (3) some amount of people who simply represent the statistical extremes of normal human variation. The above example is dry, but the implications are important to what you are saying, because you take the DSM as a supreme way of describing expert opinion on what is pathological (except for when it is corrupted by politicians), when the DSM doubles both as a clinical tool and a research tool.  Also, if you don't trust the DSM IV-TR of current time (because of political powers interfering with the DSM revision process), and you also now believe that research material can be politically influenced (it's fair to say it can, though we must also be concerned with scope and magnitude), what research material are you going to have us trust that also coincidentally supports your argument about how homosexuality is pathological?  Do you anticipate a reversing trend in psychological and medical journals where authors are persuaded that homosexuality is a pathology?",1
"""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."" —Genesis 1:27  Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. ""Have ye not read,"" He said, ‘that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.  So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanity—like the domino effect.  I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.  People—primarily the homosexual community—say, ""Who are others to say who we should be able to love?"" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. Aha—therein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual ""marriages."" You see the truth is, it's not about ""love""—it is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, ""So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..."" But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying ""Well that's what homosexuals want to do!""   First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, ""... to love thy neighbor as thyself..."" for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, ""commandmentS""—plural. Immediately proceeding ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" He says the first and greatest commandment is ""You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."" [Following is the second greatest commandment] ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? —They actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden.   People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CAN—there is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birth—this is what's called ""our cross to bare""... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.  And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this.   Peace.",0

"I don't think that having two mothers or two fathers can screw a child up. By this, I mean that I don't think he will become a serial killer or schizophrenic or anything based solely on the fact that his parents are of the same sex. I have heard that there have been tests on this sort of thing, and gay couples children have turned out to be just about 'normal.' Perhaps, if the child is female, and her parents are both male, she will turn out to be more masculine than the average girl, but what is wrong with that? I also believe that if her two parents are both very feminine, she will turn out to be 'normal.' So, it is not so much the gender of the parents, but their personalities that mold the child. In this country, many hetero parents with children get divorces, or one of the parents dies, and it is then legal for only the mother/father to raise the child on their own. So, if having either no mother/father figure screws up a child, shouldn't raising a child on your own be illegal for as long as gay adoption is?  Also, don't most, or at least some, adopted babies come from third world countries where they will end up living their lives in poverty, violence, and probably no parents if they are not adopted? I don't understand why anyone would want to see a child raised this way instead of with two men who will love and care for them. It makes me sick.",1

"Another point of issue, marriage is a religious icon.   It's possible to marry before the state only, in which case religion has nothing to do with religion anymore.    It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion.   Not letting gay people marry is a violation to the 14th amendment.   AMENDMENT XIV  SECTION 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.   If gay people cannot marry, they are deprived of a liberty that other citizens do have. Saying they cannot have this right is like saying they are not citizens, even though this Amendment clearly states ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States"".",1
"People are generally idiots. They can't accept that someone might be different from them so they create stupid laws and discriminate, it's just.. a mess. But really, gay marriage is like any other marriage.",1
"In short, yes, gay marriage should be allowed. If marriage between a man and a woman is legal (as well as intermarriage) then why should it not be allowed between those of the same sex?   Those who argue that it shouldn't be allowed because marriage is of a particular religion that forbids anyone being gay then they should also agree that marriage should therefore have nothing to do with being a legal matter in which a couple gets benefits from getting married such as in the areas of medical, taxes, death, and more. If gay couples can't receive these rights, then no one else should. Everyone should therefore be reduced to what many gays have to due now and just have a ceremonoly marriage with no legal benefits.   Also those who are against it due to their religion need to realize that whether or not it is against their religion or not, that has nothing to do with it because ,last I checked, my country has the freedom of religion, meaning not everyone has to follow what one person believes. And in all honestly, a gay marriage will ,in the most, not affect the said person any more then it does now.   Another point people agrue is that gay marriage will lead to and allow what is not traditionally thought of as a family and to many, this is unacceptable. And to those people, I say that the traditional family of a mother and father has already become less popular then it was a even a few decades ago. In today's world, there are many forms of what is now considered a ""family"". There are those who are raised with only a single parent, those who are divorced, those who were born from a seregate and raised by a different couple, ect, are only a few examples. People need to realize that times change and that a major change is happening now whether they agree with it or not.  In the end, I believe gay marriage should be allowed with all the legal rights and benefits that a marriage between a man and a woman have and those who think otherwise are basicly just discriminating against what is different from themselves. Eventually gay marriage will be legallize just as intermarriage has been and future generations will look down upon those who are against gay marriage now as we look down upon those who disagreed with intermarriage. Simple as that.",1

Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word. The racists tried to change the definition of the word and lost. As they should have.

They were able to get married, and the passage of prop 8 took away that right. Regardless of whether not you agree with prop 8, it took away a right they already had and therefore is discrimination.   Children will be taught that same-sex marriage is ok  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you do not live in California.

"The right to vote has nothing to do with marriage benefits     I think it does in that a democracy can at times tend toward a tyranny of the majority over the minority – if women can’t vote, it takes a majority of people (or, as in the case of constitutional amendments 2/3 of both houses and 3/4 of all state legislatures) who must give them that right, and if a majority of law makers are not gay, it still takes a majority of those law makers to agree to make gay marriage legal.    I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle   I believe  you are right . I think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. – I think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. As I tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire US Code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. Additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. Even treaties that deal with recognition of US marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. Repealing DOMA would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today.   The only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts.  I think past compromises like don’t ask don’t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more.

I would argue that someone who does not love themselves, should not attempt to love anyone else. You have to love yourself, and you have to have a genuine love for someone else in order to successfully raise a child. The child understand that love.

If we just blindly followed everything the Constitution says, wouldn't we still have prohibition of alcohol, and wouldn't it be up to the states whether or not women and minorities not have the right to vote? Those were all changed in amendments. And I personally would support an amendment SPECIFYING a separation of church and state. What you talk about, people enforcing that churches do not talk about politics, I have never heard that before, but if it's true, the solution is not to say that because they can do that, you can ban gay marriage, the solution is to day that you should not be able to ban gay marriage and they can not enforce churches to not talk about politics. You're moving in the complete wrong direction, not in the right one. Without a separation of church and state, you get a government that influences its people or even forces its people to do things against their own religion.  I think you deeply do not understand the phrase ""separation of church and state"". It does not mean that one can not make references to politics or the state in church as you seem to imply, or even that one can not make references to the church in public funded buildings. What it means is that publicly funded things like schools, and any kind of government facility including courthouses, can not express support for, or utilize public prayers, or anything similar regarding religion, and yes that includes Atheism. A separation is not state-sponsored Atheism, as they are also not allowed to show support for a disbelief in God. A separation of church and state simply means that they can not coerce the people or force them into any kind of religion.  I think that your desire to ban gay marriage is what's really wrong and unconstitutional here. If a gay Christian wants to marry his partner, is it not a violation of the free exercise clause of the constitution to not allow him to do so, that is, if you really believe marriage is a religious institution? My main point as a Libertarian, is that marriage is simply voluntary human relations.

In short these people do not believe in the separation of church and state, and are nothing less then fear ridden, insecure little tyrants. I can go into the details of their psychology and position, but its not flattering at all. Laws should be backed by secular and logical reasoning with the goal of increasing the well being of society. Marriage improves ""the lot in life"" of many people, for some it doesn't but they find it worth the try. Allowing gay marriage means that more people will find marriage an improvement to their lives.

"Heterosexual marriage laws the ground work for a relationship that creates and raises children. (sperm + egg). Now, the goverment gives many benefits economically, tax wise, etc to married couples. [2] The reason they only give them to traditional couples is because of their ability to procreate. Having children is the only way to continue society and advance our culture and race. As the heterosexual couples are the only people who can advance society in this way, and well pay back the benefits they get through marriage, then they deserve a state recognition. The goverment makes laws based of of interests, and their interest in this case is procreation. Therefore allowing gay marriage would be unjust as it debars the special recognition the heterosexual couples deserve.  People who are pro gay marriage usually have the claims that marriage is about love, but this is far from true. If marriage is about love, then why is the state involved? They are involved due to some sort of interest. If the goverment cared about love, then they would attempt to regulate and control friendships or non marital relationships.  The reason they regulate marriage over these other relationships is because marriage is where you are meant to produce a larger workforce. The reason they do not regulate other relationships is because they have no good reason to do so, at all.  The goverment in marriage needs two things: 1) legal commitment, 2) procreation and the ability to raise a child. A boyfriend girlfriend relationship may produce offspring in the process, but as they are not legally binding situation it is easier for them to break apart, and they will not be able to raise the child. A homosexual relationship will be lacking the legal bind, and the ability to produce offspring. Even if we did give them a legal bind, they would not be able to create children therefore not fulfilling the states interest fully.  One argument used against the procreation argument is the infertile argument. This objection is a misunderstood rebuttal, they do not understand the debate at point. The argument is not fully based of of the ability to reproduce, but rather a type of relationship in which procreation is possible to start off. It is not an argument fully based of of the argument they can make kids, but also an argument based of of the ability to have the similar effect, a procreative type union.  My opponent without a doubt will start to argue as marriage has benefits isn't it fair homosexuals receive them too? Any society, goverment, or institution that distinguishes marriage in a certain way will prohibit some types of marriage. A prohibition of SSM does not violate the equal protection clause as we must first have a definition of what marriage is. You cannot confirm that a SSM ban is unconstitutional unless we determine exactly what marriage is, and what it is for. [3]  It is only unconstitutional if they are unjustly debarred the right. Ex: Is it unconstitutional if we debar a murderer from a gun? No. That is a just cause, and with my secular case against gay marriage I have proven they are justly debarred the right. By saying it is unconstitutional you are saying it discriminates without just cause, and that this group deserves the right. As murderers do not deserve a right to a gun, then it is constitutional. In the states eyes homosexual couples cannot produce offspring therefore do not fulfill states interest, and do not deserve the right.  Just because something may have inherent good effects does not mean they deserve the legal benefits. The challenge to my opponent, and the argument he needs to press is: What are the states interest in giving these couples rights? If the State has no reason to give you benefits then why should they? Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.  Last statement:  1."" Heterosexual union is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).  2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.  3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.  4. Civil ordinances which recognize gay marriage as comparable to heterosexual marriage constitute a rejection of the special value of heterosexual unions.  5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.  6. Therefore, gay marriage is unjust.""[1]   http://wisdomandfollyblog. com/2008/10/02/ an-argument-against-gay-marriage/     http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/ marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html    Sherif Girgis, Robert P.

"Not only does it generally just mean that a state will recognize the acts of another state not enforce the other state's laws within its borders.   Nowhere have I said that it does any such thing, nor would it have to. A state cannot say that a marriage never took place, if it occurred legally within another state. They do not have to make Gay marriage legal, simply that they must recognize marriages which have legally already occurred in other states. This is all that the clause requires.   It also says specifically that Congress can determine the effect thereof   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself, then it would not be an effect by definition.    If my state says I can't buy alcohol on Sunday and I drive across the border does the other state have to not sell me alcohol?   {sigh}  No. This is not how the clause works. The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another. Say for example, that I bought fireworks legally in one state and brought them into another state where they are illegal to purchase. The new state cannot take them away from me or prosecute me for having purchased them.",0
"That is exactly what I am saying.  You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying.   Did you not notice that my first response to your post said ""Supported"" ?? Then you began to argue against something which I never said.   A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here. from DOMA:  of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."" - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another. The FFC clause gives them the power to make this determination   No it doesn't. FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states and DOMA basically says ""states don't have to recognize gay marriages of other states"". It contradicts FFC. DOMA is an exception, not an effect. It is entirely unconstitutional, on multiple grounds. It violates the FFC clause and it violates the tenth amendment, because the federal government is not delegated the power by the Constitution to determine the legality of marriages, this is reserved to the states, unless of course if you include the equal protection clause in which case it would still make DOMA unconstitutional.",0

"Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent.   It's not that arbitrary, since consent is already defined in law. And the very basic requirement of a marriage is that there are at least two consenting parties involved.   If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   Well, homosexuals can make that claim (though I'm absolutely positive that you're oversimplifying their case) because the issue of consent is both de facto and de jure. It's already assumed as a matter of ritual and law. Showing that you love each other is one thing, but not running away is not a form of legitimate consent, since consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection.   There are a lot of ""ifs"" in your argument. But you're also skewing the legal definition of ""consent"" to make a weak point. Within the strictures of marriage, express consent is required. This means that a personhood of adequate intelligence can make a reasoned decision in response to the prompting or initiations of another and  come to accord  with said proposal. Your cat can't do that. Now, if you're actually willing to take the time to demonstrate that your cat is capable of such faculties, then you have a case. Until then, you're blowing hot air.   To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard.   No. I don't.",1
"Rousseau disagrees. Hobbes and Rousseau had this debate roughly 400 years ago. Rousseau's view prevailed. Rights flow from the natural right that everyone has a right to dictate their own destiny. Hence, they're not a human construct.   I, then, must agree with Hobbes.   Yes.   I bought Leviathon awhile ago. Now I wish to read it. Tell me, in what writing came the debate betwixt Rousseau and Hobbes?   Both. Overbearing monarchs infringed on human rights.    Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest. Granting them this right does not infringe on the rights of others and is not a threat to public safety.   Homosexuality leads to diseases, as do other sexual perversions.",0

"To put it another way, marriages are what societies are made of just like bricks are what buildings are made of.   You could still have society without marriage. And even if that weren't true, expanding the legal definition of marriage to allow for gays would not be a radical change. More akin to changing the texture of the bricks.   doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.   Was enforcing racial integration tyranny? No. There are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not.   You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent.   No, I don't. But I think there are important similarities. Both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity. They cannot be changed. Neither makes a person inferior. Discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound.   Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone.   Again they are not the same, just similar. But saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading. It's like saying shouting is ""just a behavior"" and therefore people should repress their anger at all times. It's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality.   You wouldn't say it's a good thing?   I was referring to homosexuality, not gay marriage. Being gay is neither good nor bad, it's neutral. Gay marriage, on the other hand,  is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance.   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives.   Oh, wow, that's a pretty hardcore view. How is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder? All I see is two people having sex. No harm done.   Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good.   Agreed. But gay sex is not one of them.   Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Hahaha. You're a funny guy.   Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   Well, they  are  born gay and they  can't  change, so that's just telling them the truth. Why should their conscience be troubled? That would only make sense if they bought into all that Christian nonsense.   ...waving the magic wand of neutrality...   You wouldn't take seriously a pamphlet from Neo-Nazis about how Jews are inferior people would you? Do you not understand the importance of neutrality?   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.    Homosexuality is not a behavior, it's a sexual orientation. Gay sex is the behavior. We can and should repress bad behaviors, but gay sex is not a behavior bad enough to warrant repression.   you...deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul)   Morality does not come from anything supernatural. True morals are founded on logic, not on faith.",1
"That's ridiculous.  That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he  wasn't  gay, that's why it took so long to figure out. Okay, in that example, bi-sexual. But people do not ""turn"" gay because of outside influence, it's something internal, in the brain.   I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't.   Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay. Do you seriously think life is somehow better or easier if you're gay? Do you  not  think gay people get made fun of, discriminated against, and avoided all of the time  for  being gay? How on earth would you justify your opinion that somehow society  wants  you to be gay?   the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me   Again, how so?

"What does it mean to have gay marriages legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.",0

"I have been in a same sex relationship for 12 yrs and have been legally recognized in New Jersy only by a civil union which has limited benefits in comparison to heterosexual marrige.

"Most Americans don't what gay marriage to be legal.   With respect to same-sex marriage, it's become an issue of the tyranny of the majority.

A large number of animals have homosexuals within their population. Nature has nothing to do with it.

"In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when it’s two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.    You claim that my argument, ‘fail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation.   You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.  Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question.   Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.  Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt.   Argument is both invalid and fallacious.  Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious)   Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)  There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.  They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.    I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium. (the truth, falsity, or validity of an argument is not subject to a legal system)  Bare in mind that my arguments are for the sake of knowledge and not the sake of attacking or debating; so take no offence for none is intended.",0

"Force themselves into a club where there not wanted?  How does any gay getting married effect any straight couple? Your argument, which you continue to repeat time and time again, is ridiculous, and you know it.  All gays want is equality, and if the government stopped using the word marriage but instead used civil unions that would be  great . Look at this  site  that advocates equal marriage rights. It gives a number of scenarios:   We want the Flag of Equal Marriage to be complete, with all 50 stars lit up. We see three routes to marriage equality, as we define it:  1. Every individual state could pass a law allowing same-sex marriage.  2. The federal government could repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and allow same-sex marriage at the federal level, overriding all state-level bans.  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.   So here you're arguing a straw man ""gays aren't being reasonable"" argument.  Back to the whole ""joining a club thing"" and why it's bullshit. When African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted, should they have stopped?  In addition, marriage isn't a club. There aren't members only meetings where only married people are allowed to get into, and married people don't have to do anything for other married couples. Marriage is the legal (and often religious/cultural) union of two people who love each other and intend to spend the rest of their lives together. So allow me to repeat: how does letting gays marry affect, even a little bit, straight married couples? What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?  If this is the best argument that you can come up with for opposing gay marriage, maybe you need to reevaluate your position and realize how ridiculous you sound (even more so than usual).",1

"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas.   As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.  Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.  Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.  In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.  Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights.   No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.  I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them.",1
"Even though this debate is huge, I feel compelled to write my own argument anyway.

What difference does it make if the parents are homosexual or heterosexual?",1
"There are many practical reasons for not allowing same sex marriage. I forgot a few but one I can recall goes like this: studies show that children need a mother and a father for parental role models. It keeps the child’s emotional health in check.

"I am a straight Christian and support gay marriage. Why? Simple. Separation of church and state.   Gay marriage opposition states that they want to preserve the sanctity of marriage. Let's look at the definition of sanctity: the quality or state of being holy or sacred.   That tells me: you cannot preserve the holiness of an act that is governed by the law. That is a violation of church and state.   If someone, a Christian or other religious person, wants to get married under the eyes of God in their church, then fine. But it is not our place to impede upon the rights of others that want to be married under the eyes of the law. Or even God, for that matter. I know many gay Christians. It is not our place to judge others or take away from them. Prop 8 is threatening to take away the rights of 18,000 ALREADY MARRIED couples. And all because our religious views clash with their lifestyles. This is not our battle.   I support gay marriage, and I support my gay married friends and will continue to fight with them for their equality.  Gay marriage does not hurt anyone except those of whom we are stripping away rights. There is no way to prove that gay marriage would impose upon our children in our schools. And besides, kids are going to learn about it anyway, right? Look at MTV right now. You think these kids don't know what's going on?",1

"""So as i said, go ahead and pass the laws, but don't take away the rights of others to believe that homosexuality is wrong, because THAT is what is against the constitution.""  Hmm. Looks like we should reread the Constitution. And also understand what anti-discrimination laws do. They DO not require a person be less bigoted, but only require they not be guided by their prejudices to a point where they deny another human being of their equal rights under the law. CRA of 1964 didn't stop anyone set on being a bigot from doing so.  While it's quite easy to capitalize words like FREEDOM and think we are making a stunning point, we must remember that it is impossible for everyone everywhere to have the freedoms he or she would want. Rights and freedoms and privileges will always contradict. Thus, we all have to look around and agree as a society that we will value other human beings and chose not to deprive them of certain rights, especially in favor of our deleterious 'freedoms.'   Remember that not of the 'rights' that we have in American (speech, etc.) are really natural, but the product of a country that was based on the ideals that all men were created equal, working towards the goal of a 'more perfect union' by canonizing laws that are in line with that humanitarian ideal.",1
"In fact there is evidence proving that homosexuality is genetic. At this point people are just willfully denying this fact because it doesn't fit into their world view.

"The specific thing you requested was for me to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that.   You said that, ""I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue."" I thought I gave a perfect example where this was not the case. Some people just don't want to be around other people. That does not make them a bigot nor does it make them ignorant. Not granting gays the word marriage but granting them the same rights does not make one a bigot nor does it make one ignorant  nor does it hurt the gay community.   You say that same but separate is not good enough as though as soon gays are allowed to marry the bigots will suddenly see the errors of their ways. That's not going to happen. All the litigation in the world will never force a bigot to accept you. He will just look at you in the eye, turn around, and roll his eyes.  My argument does not call people names. Your argument calls anyone opposed to gay marriage a bigot or ignorant.   The side you're on is considered liberal. The side I'm on is seen as conservative. I don't categorize my argument as conservative because it takes a middle of the road approach.  Take a little  (your rights)  give a little  (leave the word behind). This is what I call negotiation. The side you're on is not interested in negotiation and is seen as militant; it's a ""my way or the highway"" approach and then your side acts surprised when they encounter resistance.  The side your on wants people to put themselves in their shoes but they are not willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other side.  The side I'm on is seen as being based on religion. I don't categorize my argument as being based on religion because my argument does not invoke religion. It invokes human nature. My argument is also constructive in that it alienates a smaller group on the religious right. It is pragmatic and rational in that it gets gays their rights sooner and all they are leaving on the table is just a word.  People can want all they want. I never said it was unreasonable. I just think that it is not practical at this point in time as evidence by proposition 8. I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost? Take your time, regroup, do a ""lessons learned"" analysis of what went wrong and why and then try again later.  People can want all they want but that does not mean that they are entitled to it or that they deserve it or that they have a right to it.  The status quo does not seem right to me. Otherwise I would never have suggested to bypass them. I saw an injustice occurring and I tried to think of a pragmatic approach towards getting what I consider important and leaving behind what I don't consider important in the shortest amount of time. That was my contribution. That was my way of stepping up to the plate and trying to fix things and I got slammed. This explains why others that have tried to help the gay community but encountered the negative feed back have stopped supporting gay marriage more than anything else.   What allowed slavery to continue was not inaction and complacency. People were working towards fixing it. What allowed slavery to continue for as long as it did is that it takes time to change the world.   The gay community is not asking for certain rights, it is demanding them. The gay community is not interested in negotiating and this stance is alienating a lot of potential allies. The gay community is taking an in your face approach and are surprised when the other side responds in kind.  The group that followed Martin Luther King were not militant. The Black Panthers were.  The gays that are peacefully trying to advance their agenda are not militant. The ones vandalizing churches are.  The gay community wants to portray itself as being the new civil rights fighters of our generation. The black community finds this highly offensive. What is the worst a gay man has had to openly endure in the last 10 years and compare that to what a black man had to endure during the 60's. There's no comparison. The gay community as the new civil rights fighters of our generation is an exaggeration; it is a tactic meant to get them what they want, nothing else.  No one promised gays the right to marriage. They can have their love legally recognized under a different name and not suffer because of it. They can be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness without the having the word marriage. The word marriage will not magically get them to be acceptance nor get them a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted. They have to find happiness within themselves. No one can grant it to them so no one can deny it to them.  I hope you see why I am upset at those hypocritical gays that say ""empathize with our suffering in a society that does not fully accept us"" and then turn around and vandalize churches. Now that is a real crime and it is not very accepting of the other side. I don't think they are empathizing with the other side, do you? I guess they forgot to put on their neighbors shoes.   Do you think that when gays call the other side hateful and bigot and ignorant that they are able to see the humanity of the other side? Does maligning someone help you solve your differences or does it hinder? And if it hinders, why do it. What value is there in calling someone a bigot? It is a great tactic. The Nazis used it with great success to get people to think that it was OK to kill Jews because, after all, Jews were vermin. You see?",0

"I've been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of ""issues"" they have about homosexuality.   First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfish   My response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that ""completes the family"", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""   Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them    Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?  Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.   Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can ""appoint"" someone to look after their child   Someone actually used the word ""property"", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else.   Since when are human beings ""property""?  As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young.   Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight.    But the child is going to be bullied!   Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents?   The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience.",1
"Okay, let me first make it clear that I never condoned violent action as a way to solve the problem. Gandhi and MLK Jr. are some of my heroes because they affected change in the most peaceful ways possible. What I also liked about them is they both recognized injustice and stood up to it without compromise. Gandhi wanted the British out of India and did not compromise on this issue. Martin Luther King wanted equal rights for African-Americans and did not compromise. There is a  big  difference between not wanting to compromise, and being narrow minded.   You say ""Some people just don't want to be around other people."" This to me is a type of discrimination. If I told you, I am not bigoted, I just don't want to be around Mexicans, you would be appalled.  Here is the definition of a bigot in wikipedia:   A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own   Looking at this definition you can see clearly that not wanting to be around people who choose to be homosexual is bigotry. But that is irrelevant because   no one is forcing people to be around homosexuals  . This is what I don't understand about your argument. If homosexuals get married does that mean suddenly they are going to suddenly show up at your door, and when you refuse them say ""Hey, you have to let us in, we're legally married now."" That is ridiculous.  Of course legalizing gay marriage will not automatically get rid of bigots, I never said that and I don't believe it. When slavery was abolished, did it get rid of racism? When woman's suffrage was granted, did it get rid of sexism? No! But in the long run it helped  a lot . Can you imagine anyone believing either of these issues as having two reasonable sides today? The bigots will not change their mind, but their children will be raised in a society that is more accepting, and hopefully this will have a large affect for future generations.  Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.  I agree that maybe gay marriage will not come to fruition in the immediate future, but that does not mean that people should stop fighting for what they believe in. Martain Luther King demanded equal rights for African-Americans. Feminists demanded equal rights for women. Asking nicely, ""can we please get married, if it isn't to much of a problem for you?""   Of course what blacks suffered through in the pre-civil rights era was terrible. That does not lessen what homosexuals are going through right now. I know from seeing it at my school how much homosexuals are mistreated and outcast. This is socially acceptable,  and it shouldn't be . Progress will probably be attained in smaller steps but only if people continue to fight for their rights. Obama is the perfect example of this: in order to win the presidency he had to support civil unions but not gay marriage. Lucky for me, I'm not a politician. I don't have to temper my views with the current public will. I can say what I truly believe. If a compromise were reached in the federal government that extended rights to homosexuals through civil unions I would be in favor of that, but after it was passed I would go right back to fighting for marriage. Homosexuals even lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because they can't marry or even have civil unions:   http://outtheotherear.wordpress. com/2008/08/26/ spotlight-arkansas-gay-adoption/    I also have a problem with you comparing the Homosexuals to the Nazis. First, the Nazis killed homosexuals, because they thought they were, to use your word, ""vermin."" What the homosexuals are not doing is killing or hurting others in any way by demanding marriage. By denying them marriage, other people are hurting homosexuals. So who is more like the Nazi's now? Don't you think its justified to loathe your oppressors? This does not mean violence, as I said earlier I am against violence.  Speaking of Bigotry though, I want you to see what homosexuals have to put up with:   http://www.godhatesfags.com/   Is it unfair for me to call them bigots, or am I being narrow minded?  Finally I would like to respond to this comment you made:   I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?   And I can only respond with this quote:   ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  -Edmund Burke",1

"Two rebuttals here i'd like to offer:  1) research about homosexual couples being better parents or that homosexuality is genetic. I'm sorry, but neither of these things are proven facts, and there is a lot of controversial research on both sides of the aisle. I think both sides should be able to agree here that neither side has been proven. I know, I know, you can show me 100 studies that say the above is true, but guess what, I can show you 100 studies that say the opposite and then we just get into the ""who's study is better"" thing, and it's just a waste of time. Many things can be conclusively proven. These are not yet in that category for either side. Besides, for all the ""studies show"" comments above, no one has cited a single one. I find the funniest thing about such studies is that everyone has heard of them and is sure something has been shown conclusively, but no one is quite sure when or where.  2) the adoption thing is really irrelevant I think. In this country there aren't hordes of orphans wishing for parents to adopt them. This is a myth taken from the situation some time ago. Walk into an adoption clinic, things have really changed. It's not easy to adopt. Now outside of this country things are very different I know, but I still don't think gay marriage is going to significantly impact this. Feel free to disagree with me here, I just really think this is a seperate topic. Oh, and if you disagree, I think you will see that studies show I'm right ;)  (I'm kidding in case you didn't catch that) :)",0

"I agree with HGrey's point here about the subjectivity of gender. I do not think there are specific things that can be ""taught"" through ONLY one gender. However, I do think having a parent of that gender helps; a daughter would want to talk to her mother about her period, if given the choice. But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).  To quickly state my piece:  Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt. I do not think a child  needs  a mother and father to get a healthy perspective on things. I found an old article about this issue a while ago:    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/ 26florida.html    It was about the Florida ban on gay adoption that was ruled unconstitutional (but you can see that from the title).  I even found an older article about a ""new take"" on the American family:  http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/25/ gay.adoption/index.html    By doing a quick google search, you can see that it is not on the forefront of the political crossfire as gay marriage is, but it is a important issue. I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever. It is a touchy issue for most people, since everyone has to listen to their mother-in-laws bicker once and a while.  I'm interested to hear more from the anti-gay adoption side.

"I have never bought the argument that by giving gay marriage a different name that you automatically lower the status of gay marriage.   I have never bought the argument that just by having a different word for gay marriage, that you are saying that gay love is less worthy.

By calling the person retarded, it doesn't automatically make me see him as less of a human being.   A rose, by any other name, is still a rose.

"The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life   The ""drinks"" analogy was used to explain why we shouldn't go around changing the definition of words.

Drink OJs until you get OJ poisoning if you like :) But don't get an OJ and call it a lemonade and then expect others to accept that. Of course you're free to call an OJ a lemonade amongst yourselves. That's how you should relate the ""drinks"" analogy to gay marriage.  .  Gay marriage doesn't harm me in any way and I've never even come close to saying that anywhere, so please don't think that.  .   Allowing gays to marry doesn't impede straight marriage in any way   It wouldn't impede directly, however like I explained, it will alter the idea of marriage. We were talking about the idea of marriage and I simply don't want my children to be confused about that idea and what it means. That's why with the rate things are going now (all kinds of unions are included in the idea of marriage), I'd even like to restrict the definition, not expand it.",0

"This is a topic far more complicated than gay marriage. I believe society is still trying to get along with gay marriage and gay pride as to throw gay adoption in the way.

"I just spent the last five minutes looking through my arguments seeing if I could find where I said ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" and guess what? I wasted my time! Don't put things in quotes as if I said them when I clearly didn't. If you want to use quotes copy and paste, I have written plenty of stuff, I'm sure you can find something that will go to prove your point.  If I am understanding you correctly, here is your argument:  People are not being bigoted just because they don't want to be around people.  Am I right so far? Because I agree with this part. Next you say:  some people who don't want gays to get married only because they don't want to be around them.  Is this correct? Because I think you might be right that this could be some peoples reasons. No one is asking them to hang out with homosexuals, or even talk to them so I don't understand their rationale, but at least it's an explanation. So so far we agree.  Now here's where your logic decides to jump off a cliff into a pile of razor blades after having swallowed a gallon of vodka and three bottles of sleeping pills:  People are not being bigoted, or intolerant when they allow their discomfort of being around gays to affect their decisions as to whether gays should be allowed to get married.  Is this the basic point your making? If not ignore the rest of the argument and clarify your position, but if so keep reading.   Denying others rights because you don't like their lifestyle   is intolerant and bigoted  . I may not like people with your opinions but I would  never  try to take away your right to voice them. Here is where the difference lies. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with how people live. I admit, I would be pretty uncomfortable around a man who wore nothing but a thong all day, but I wouldn't take away his rights. I could decide not to hang out with the thong-man. I might purposefully avoid him, but I would not take away his rights or the rights of all the thong-men in the entire state. Why? Because I know that if  my  lifestyle was not the popular or accepted one then I would not want people trampling on my rights.  Your metaphor is an inaccurate one for two reasons: A) there is no logic in a groups wanting to change the name of their condition; and (this is the important one) B) homosexuals aren't forcing anything on people, merely asking for the same rights as afforded to others. A change in the name of your condition does not afford you more rights. (I considered including a C that said your an idiot but I didn't think that would add anything to my argument)",1

"You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).   I have shown your scenarios to be wrong.   [Taken from my previous comment]   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only female homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.  Response to premise 1:  First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.  Response to premise 2:  It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.",1

"Actually Hinduism and early scriptures on Buddhism do not place any discernible restriction on homosexuality. In fact, Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. I can't speak for Islam or Judaism because I have no knowledge of them, so I'll skip over them. But that's not the point I want to make.  The meaning of the pursuit of the marriage between homosexual couples is in the desire to be seen as a legal, justifiable entity with the same freedoms that we heterosexuals take for granted. Why should this be allowed? Well, why not? Why does it seem as though the sanctions of governmental regulation is influenced by Christianity? The concept of marriage long predates most religions, including Christianity. Actually, it was established as a means to restrict the promiscuity of the couple, or group, as polygamy existed when it was established as well.   The problem is that regulations that are established now were molded by, and cater to, Christians for the most part. It is not the government's job to act as a church; it acts to preserve itself and the rights of the governed. Why would it be beneficial to have a government that imbues ""unequal"" rights to law-abiding citizens? Just to cater to religiously-uptight citizens who don't even have a particular adherence to the religion in the first place?",1

If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be).   But I do think you raised an interesting point. It would be intriguing to hear from a child who is raised by gay parents, or from an adult who was raised by gay parents. I think that would provide more of a psychological insight. They'd be a first-hand source.",0

There are governmental privileged and rights granted with a marriage LICENCSE, and there is no secular basis to deny homosexuals these benefits from the government. There is no legitimate interest which the government has in doing such.",1

To say that ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" is wrong. To say that ""everyone else says that everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot so it must be true"" is wrong.   Are you saying that it is physically impossible for someone to be against gay marriage for some reason other than being a bigot?  Think about this. If it were a true statement that anyone who doesn't want to be around a specific group is a bigot, then why doesn't the definition of the word say that? Could it be that there are plenty of other reasons for people not to want to be around a specific group? What if you were shy and only wanted to hang around your own kind? What if you were deaf and only wanted to hang around deaf people? What if people with tinnitus wanted to be called deaf and deaf people were opposed, would they be bigots?",0

Civil law is ""the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters.""

Obviously I am not accusing you of lynching black people, or using terrorism, but what I do want you to understand is that the bigotry and intolerance for those different from yourself is equally comparable. I know that your immediate reaction is to take offense to this statement, but know that the only reason that there appears to be a difference between your problem with homosexuals and the racism that used to exist (and in some places still exists) in America is that the former is more socially acceptable.  Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. ""Dude, don't be gay"" or ""what are you a faggot?"" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people. I'm probably guilty of using similar phrases myself, and I'm not proud of that fact. What I desperately want you to understand is that homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice. Some people are  born  different, and if we shun them for being different, make fun of them, and convince them that the feelings that they have are immoral, then we really are no better then the racists of our past.  You claim homosexuality to be immoral. When I attack this point, you hide behind a Bible and complain about me attacking your opinions. Then when I argue that there are numerous acts that the Bible considers immoral, but yet you choose to ignore, you say something along the lines of,  well obviously that stuff isn't immoral , and I would agree. There is nothing immoral about touching pigskin, or eating shellfish. However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe.  So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral? Please do not use the argument that lots of people agree with you...we can both see how that is not a valid argument. Also, I must ask you not to respond: ""that's just my opinion"" because that is not even a position. We must have reasons for our opinions, and those reasons must make sense, otherwise we are deluding ourselves.  I look forward to your response.",1

But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

"Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples ""marriage"", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.  I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.  Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.  Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.  I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.  If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.  This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.  As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.  My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term ""gay marriage"", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.  This speaker did not state ""that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'"" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called ""gay marriage"" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction.",0

"Thanks for making my point. Your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. You said ""Marriage is a contract"" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. A contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. And historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. Which leads us to the next question.  ""When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?""  In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report;  http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/                                        costofdivorce.pdf    So yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it. And primarily because marriages produce the next generation.  You said"" The human spirit should be without bonds"" this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil, not to mention the question of this debate. People doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society, it's why we have laws. If we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary. But let me ask you, what is more creative and productive, the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind? Before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write, with out which you couldn't have this debate.  Final thought. You said ""Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect."" Heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do. How is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say ""A"" is the same as ""non-A""",0
"You can't seriously use a dictionary definition to argue against gay marriage, especially when the definition of words and phrases changes all the time.  Fact of the matter is, any modern society worth its salt is always changing. Fifty years ago inter-racial relationships were unthinkable, let alone marriages. Once upon a time marriage had more to do with status and family importance than anything else. The world will not collapse due to gay marriage and those who feel it will are ignorant of history.",1

"It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.   It can't. You won't be able to prove it because I will tear down your proof again and again.   Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it.   You  still  don't get it. You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence. Tell me how else do you want me to make it simpler for you? I have already given you a substantial analogy and yet you seem to thick to understand such a simple concept.   I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   Exactly. So don't try to claim that it is knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.   Are you that stupid? Believe is  never  knowledge. And therefore, your examples are cases of false analogies.   lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    WRONG . Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. I'm a Geography scholar, see. So don't try and pull any stunts with Geographical terminology with me ;)   t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life.   Which is a contradiction. Gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you?   If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only  female  homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.   Response to premise 1 :  First, why does it have to be only  female  homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the  population size , this has no bearing on whether  society  will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Response to premise 2 :  It is a hasty generalisation to say that  all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   I have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. There is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. As I have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. Again I repeat, I am well learned in Geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. We can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation  might  still occur. Furthermore, it  DOES NOT  mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. There still  will  be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time.   I have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. You are wrong on both arguments at the same time.   If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment.   You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of  most  of the suffering of the Jewish people?   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person.   A rapist cannot  try  to rape a person. He has  already  rape d  a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   However, i am also right for saving a life.   Committing murder is  not  a characteristic of rapists.   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy.""   The One Child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of Mao Zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it  might  or might  not  be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China  relative  to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities.   Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.   Wrong. That is only after the revision of the Policy. The original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. Did you know that there were on average 33  forced  abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the One Child policy? Please don't talk about things you don't know. You'll only make a fool of yourself.",1

"Yes it should. The principal argument of who doesn't want to the law allow that say that it's against the Bible.

"In my own personal opinion being homosexual isn't right and thats it.  And the communites around me doesn't get too involved in homosexual activicties even the government.  It's common to see girls and boys hanging out together but not boys and boys hugging each other touching here an there.  Kids learn from their parents and it's monkey see monkey do. When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.  Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.  It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.  What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.  Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions. I personally abhor christianity because of its contradictions and it's violation of karma.  One quote i recieved from my friend who is a christian. He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.  'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.  This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.  And god don't love us too.  If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.  And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.  Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.

"I'm all for replacing marriage with a different contract that likewise incorporates someone into your family, just with out the religious and sexual undertones.    We already have that. It's called marriage. It's not a religious or sexual issue. It's a state issue in recognizing the merging of two families. The religious ritual is a superfluous (but meaningful to some) practice. It actually has no bearing whatsoever on the actual legitimacy of the marriage. And honestly, I don't see what sex has to do with marriage. If it was relevant at all, we'd stop impotent or infertile people from marrying. But we don't. It's only relevant when all these closeted homosexuals struggle against their sexuality and try to fight the very things they're doing in secret.",1
"1. As far as I know marriage isn't for women to be whipped around and be told to make sandwiches, it is to spend the rest of your life with the one person (unless you're mormon) you love the most and to be officially united.  2. I agree.  3. I hate when people bring nationality and color into this. Sally Sue didn't choose to be white and she can't stop it without harming herself either. Todd James didn't choose to be black either. You people say ""we can't choose who we love"" but I disagree a bit. I don't think we were supposed to be falling in love with the same sex and if we do feel that attraction it is easy to stop it. This applies with any genders. We are born man or woman (minus a few genetic mutations), not both. There are two genders solely for the reason of reproduction, which is what intercourse was intended for. Not for enjoyment.  4. Again, why would you bring the amount of melanin in our skin (as our color is only an adaption of our surroundings) into a discussion about homosexuality?   5. Not all men are some raging savages and if a woman is stupid enough to marry a man like that then she may deserve that relationship.

"You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence    I did proposed evidence: Books and morality.   And i do get it. Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not. You don't need to prove knowledge with evidence because knowledge is already proven by existence.    Believe is never knowledge   That is true. Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact. However, why say it when what you believe in turns out to be knowledge after all.    WRONG. Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?"" Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?"" I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.    First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals?  Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter. And it is not only female homosexuals; it is mostly female homosexuals.    Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it.""   You are right. However, without people, there isn't a society in existence. So that is why i interpret society as the population. But next time as i write, i will remind myself, hopefully, of the difference.     So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Society cannot grow independently of population. Didn't you state that society refers to the ""association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship?"" Without people, there isn't a society. That is like saying a house with no family has family rules. And i mean of a house that never had a family in the first place.    It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.    There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism. And others that i already suggested. I don't think it is a hasty remark. An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed. But then again, maybe everything in the book was all done for ""fun.""   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality. I had stated, maybe not to you, that homosexuality can become mathmaticians and scientists. Those are clearly two professions that can develop a society into a growing society. And homosexuals can adopt children.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law. So i can fairly say put society and its population in the same hand. However, these two are not exactly the same.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue. In the first scenario, you stated a question that has no effect on the changing of the scenario. Second, you made a difference to population and society but that doesn't make my scenario fallacious. They are a dinstinction but not a total one. I say to you to go into a forest and start a family with two homosexual women and two homosexual men. And in this scenario, you cannot adopt children. Can you think you can grow as a society? No, unless the women are allowing the men to impregnate themselves.    You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the Jewish people?   Im wrong for taking Hitler's life because that is against morality itself. Morality doesn't want me to kill another one of my kind. Morality's best evidence is viewed within oneself. Hitler isn't the cause of the most suffering of the Jewish people. However, thanks to him and the Nazis, the Jews were sent to the concentration camps. Of course, there are many causes. Evidence: well the best evidence i can give is wikipedia.    A rapist cannot try to rape a person. He has already raped a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   I should has said ""serial rapists."" But lol of course a rapist can try to rape. If a man rapes, he is known as a rapist. If that man against tries to rape, then it is a rapist trying to rape. I honestly believe your statement was silly to make. And your statement doesn't make my argument fallacious.    The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it might or might not be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   As stated by wikipedia, the policy came to be to control the population. I don't have the exact quotes from China's officials but it is obvious that the overpopulation was feared. Now in March 2011, the Chinese goverment is allowing its citizens to have a second couple. That is a contradiction to the original policy but it is still truthful. Again, my source is wikipedia.    Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   If you can't find the similiarities between the policy and homosexuality, i ask you, what are you smoking? But i don't want to assume you are a smoker. I think that is rude.   Overall, you didn't prove my two scenarios are fallacious.  Edit. This is a contradiction. In some sense i can see society exist without its people. I see it if i think of it as a concept. However, i don't see it in another light. In this light when all society's people die, i see society vanishing because there is no one to support it. True contradictions. Tho not all contradictions are true.",0
"OK, Does anyone edit anymore? ""marrige"" ""State"" come on, for such a serious question, one would expect care and concern in order to discern the truth.  First: Marriage is, in all of the truest sense, a contract between two individuals. A legal document does not ensure that the agreement will be forever upheld. People fall out of love all of the time. Why does sexual orientation, in the land of the free, change the definition of a contract? Marriage is a contract; why else would the courts be bogged down by disputes of property, wealth, and future holdings?  Second: When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners? We, in the U.S.A. look away when companies contract each other to form conglomerates. Why do we care so much about people in love that we would show our prejudices?  Third: The human spirit should be without bonds. Let individuals be individuals. An atmosphere of growth will yield much more than the atmosphere of ""let's wait and see"".  If people want to bind themselves to a legal document, let them. Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect.",1

"Refusing to change this definition arbitrarily is not discrimination.   Yes, it is. There is no reason not to change the definition except to prevent gays from attaining equal civil rights.    A solution to the problem would be a whole other kind of legal union for gay couples to enter into.    Or we could just let gays get married. Why not?    As of now, marriage is a legal covenant designed to take into interest the future plans of a man and women and progeny.   These plans won't be in any danger if gays are also allowed to get married.   There are also plenty of men and women who never bring progeny into the equation so that's clearly not a prerequisite for marriage.",1

There is no difference between the two in Physics either.   But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.   I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you? I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the  need  for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.

If you can't, you'll just be violating Occam's razor.   No children is ever going to be produced.   Really?   If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore.   No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I can't prove morality but morality exists.   If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   My morality even forbids me from killing species of animals  other than my own kind .   Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time.   No, they can't. That is still a contradiction.   you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate   I said ""irrelevant to the debate"", not ""irrelevant to our discussion"". Learn to read will you, idiot?   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.   These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Then why did you ""argued"" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed.    That is  not  an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.",1

(7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship.""  defign nature? nature on an objective level is everything, and if we only do things in the name of nature than whats with all this technology, buildings, and artificial crap we humans have laying around? saying something is unnatural is as convincing as saying something is ""bad"". people don't know how trite the word ""nature"" really is, nature can be defigned as anything. therefore banning marriage for two people because YOU deem it unnatural is discrimination, and prejudice.  ""As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature.""  you can argue that we have the capabilities of sex in order to reproduce. however I don't see how homosexuality is hurting nature, and even though they can't do what through sex what sex is naturally there for, they're desires and needs are still natural and therefore is natural for them to pursue it.  ""Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)""  yes to an extent, that is the first thing we think of when we think of marriage because marriage is about love and since heterosexuality is the norm, then when we think about love we automatically associate it with men and women. marriage is in culture more seen as a loving commitment, therefore if two people love each other, then isn't them marrying just part of the culture?  ""Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just.""  how can you believe that two people loving each other is not a right but something we just let them do? we are not allowed to love whoever we want?  ""As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal ""right"" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost.""  I do agree. that right or wrong in society is vague therefore we need to have it legalized in order for it to be allowed but that is only because we can't simply say that ""whatever doesn't harm anyone else is allowed and does harm others is not allowed."" because what harms or doesn't harm is subjective, therefore we created the political system we have in order to try and sort out all of the issues and together decide what is harmful and what isn't. illegalizing the right to love someone is discriminatory due to the fact that they aren't harming anyone, our government is not perfect and if people say that homosexuality is a problem then it will be treated like one, but it is not.",1

"See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject.   This is true, but while the nature of an object may be objective, the definition of a  word  is very much a matter for the subject.   For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is.   You're conflating defining and describing. An object is described, while a word is defined. For an object, it is possible to ascertain by inspection whether or not a given  description  matches the object. For a word, however, it is necessary to establish the word's  definition  as an axiom—there is no manner in which is can be deduced.  What you're doing here is describing a specific marriage (or collection of marriages; possibly even every marriage you've ever encountered) as ""a joining of male and female for procreation"" and then turning around and declaring that this must be the  definition  of marriage. But that is no more a valid conclusion than describing a specific animal (or collection of animals; possibly even every animal you've ever encountered) as ""a large, greyish thing with a trunk"" and then trying to use that as the definition of animal. In fact the most we can say is that  if  the description is accurate (ie, if the collection of animals are in fact large, greyish things with trunks), then the description establishes a subset of things which are animals. Similarly, given that there are marriages which can be described as ""a joining of male and female for procreation"", then the most we can say is that this description establishes a subset of things which are marriages. In and of itself this does not rule out the possibility of other things which are marriages.  Now, one is perfectly free to  subjectively  restrict their definitions to the subset under consideration, as an axiom, but there is nothing intrinsic to the subset which requires this, and nothing which forces others to agree with what amounts to an entirely arbitrary decision on your part. All that you've done in choosing that particular subset is declare that anything else isn't a marriage  by your definition , which reveals the debate for what it (like so many others) really is—an argument over whether your arbitrary definition is somehow  less  arbitrary than anyone else's definition.",1
"If you allow marriage between anyone other than one man and one woman....then you must allow marriage between anything, especially groups of people.   It is not true that it   must   follow.

"I don't know if you've been reading all of my arguments on this topic but what I'm proposing is for the government to stop using the word ""marriage"" and replace it with the words ""civil union"" and have those 2 words apply to heterosexual and homosexual unions.

However, If the government were to take this advice, the churches would still be able to deny to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies. In this case gays don't miss out on any ""rights"" because a wedding ceremony [performed by a representative of a given religion] is not a right.  If the government were to use the word ""marriage"" for homosexual unions, then would churches be required to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies? If so, wouldn't this mean that the government is telling the church what it can and cannot do? Is it a good idea for the government to get into the ""business"" of religion?

If you want money in life and you work to get it, and this is what makes you happy you are entitled to that. This is a right that you have, unfortunately a homosexual person in some parts of the world has no right to carry out their lives with the same dignity and respect awarded to a financial wizard.   Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people, the fact of the matter is that some of the morals thought in a lot of religious texts are odious and out of line with modern understanding of humanity and our nature.   If person x believes God says gay sex is wrong, why would that change over any number of years?   It probably will not but the question is about Gay marriage and not sex.    Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom   Whether or not God said anything is irrelevant and i don't believe in God so I don't believe he said anything. Everyone has the right to religious freedom, a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony, one that does not involve any religious denomination, beliefs or rules.   And is it bigoted to say being gay is bad?If you believe fornication (sex out of marriage) is wrong, you believe that in all cases. If you believe gay sex is wrong you believe that in all cases. Does that make someone a bigot?   No, but it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.(The following are examples from the argument you are talking about)   You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.    I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers    Anyway cockmuncher........you're gay.    Faggot.   Tell me if this is the reasoning of a religious person or a bigot.   I'd be willing to believe you think murder is wrong in all cases, does that make you a bigot?   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   You are both arguing two separate points because you have two different life views.   Is this not the point?   While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.   Like I have said belief is everyones right and I am not in the business of disputing that, but it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.",1

I feel your idea of morality is twisted, please name a country with morals or one without for that fact.   You cannot have a man and man or woman and woman or transexual and transexual   Why exactly can you not have these?   or brother and sister or brother and father or brother and mother or sister and father or sister and mother or sister and sister or brother and brother   By law siblings can not marry each other, this not the same as Homosexuality, incestuous behavior can create seriously deficient children therefore there is still a victim. Also there is not many siblings or parents of children wanting to marry each other, I am sure that there is very little people actually attracted to their siblings or parents, and should bare no mention in a debate on the right of two consenting adults to spend their lives together. Plus this is not the subject being debated.   or pedophile and young person or dead body and necrophile or a dog and a bestiality person.   Again victims involved so immoral.   Lol you being serious?   Was it not you that was harping on about the fact that Christianity and Islam are the only religions discussed/ considered in these debates, in an argument with me recently.  Buddism is not against homosexuality, Neither is Hinduism Shinto does not outline any problems with it.

"Wow, you are a chore.  I am calling you closed minded. You have to be willing to attempt to see the issue from the other person's point of view. I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin."" I'm a really good person, in fact. So to me, it feels like people want LGBT people to be all sinning and rebels and haters. No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads. The sinners are those hot Catholic school girls who take their shirts off for girls gone wild the second they get out of the house. In fact, that is what's wrong with the white picket fence scenario. It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.  By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State.",1

"Gay Parenting Does Affect Children Differently, Study Finds  -- Authors Believe Gay Parents Have ""Some Advantages""  Taking issue with 20 years of research conclusions that say there are no differences, two University of California sociologists recently re-examined data from 21 studies on gay parenting dating back to 1980.   The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same.   Leaders of national gay-affirming groups said they welcomed the article, according to an Associated Press story. ""I'm thrilled that they're tackling these issues,"" said Aimee Gelnaw, executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, who is a lesbian parent raising two children with her partner. ""Of course our kids are going to be different,"" Gelnaw said. ""They're growing up in a different social context.""   Openness to Gay Relationships  Met With ""Elation""  Kate Kendall, head of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, also is raising two children with her partner. ""There's only one response to a study that children raised by lesbian and gay parents may be somewhat more likely to reject notions of rigid sexual orientation -- that response has to be elation,"" Kendall said.   But Amy Desai, a policy analyst with the group Focus on the Family, said the new report is alarming in its suggestions that children of gay parents might be more open to homosexual activity. ""Kids do best when they have a married mother and a married father,"" she said.   A Home With No Dad is Better?  The study's co-author, Judith Stacey, is a professor of contemporary gender studies. In addition to pointing out the gender differences in the two groups of children, she states that there are in fact some advantages to an all-female parental team without Dad living in the home: a female couple tends to be more involved in the children's lives and is in greater harmony in terms of parenting approaches.   Among the findings cited by the authors:   1. Compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They show greater interest in activities with both masculine and feminine qualities. They have higher aspirations to occupations that are not traditionally female.   2. In terms of aggression and play, sons of lesbians behave in less traditionally masculine ways. They are likely to be more nurturing and affectionate than their counterparts in heterosexual families.   3. One study examined by the researchers indicated that a significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbians had engaged in a same-sex relationship (six of 25 interviewed) than those raised by a heterosexual mother (none of 20 interviewed).   4. Those raised by lesbian mothers were also more likely to consider a homosexual relationship.   5. Teen-age and young adult girls raised by lesbian mothers appear to be more sexually adventurous and less chaste than girls raised by heterosexual mothers. Sons, on the other hand, were somewhat less sexually adventurous and more chaste than boys raised by heterosexuals.   6. The studies indicate that sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on the mental health of children.   ""These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,"" said the authors.   NARTH""s Joseph Nicolosi offered the following comments: ""This paper was authored by a professor of gender studies, so it is not surprisingly that the differences on which she focused have to do with a rejection of gender conformity. Indeed, what she found makes sense -- lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons, and a masculinizing effect on their daughters.   ""But the question is, are these differences healthy? More research is needed to understand how a rejection of conventional gender roles can have not just a healthy and expansive, but also a constricting and negative effect on identity and psychological health.   ""And despite what many gender researchers claim, research tells us that the absence of a father in the home is not, on balance, good for families.""

A) I love how it was religion that was women's outlets.  B) Greeks are whites even though a lot of their philosophy was derived/similar to asian philosophy.  C) Articles written by women obviously biasedly focusing on some inequalities.

Last I checked paedophiles (etc. etc.) were not treated as equals either. You want gay rights.. you best give all these sick fucks rights.  Call the gays civil partners then. Not married. Simples.

Nearly all ancient civilisations/religions agree with me on most points.  In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.  Not many had open gay relations  etc. etc.  TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that.,0

I mean it's a drink and it'll quench my thirst, hell it even has a similar citrusy quality, but it's not lemondade so it shouldn't be called lemondade.  .  A marriage is a bit more important than a drink and when it comes to marriage, I do actually want my children to grow up with the same idea of marriage as mine. This is because my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren, etc.. I suspect that lots of other people feel the same way, and even though things do not always turn out as perfectly as we would like, the goal should not shift. Changing the definition of the word marriage is the first step away from that goal. Sure the children will find their own ways and decide what marriage is by themselves and everything like that, and I may not have much input into the process, but  if they should ever need guidence in their lives  (and I'm sure that we all do sometime in our lives) they can come to me, and I'd guide them accordingly and I'd have a legal backup. In terms of the word marriage, I re-assert my view that its definition should even be more narrow than it is currently. Old men and young women should not be included.  .  Now, people can drink OJ and call it lemonade if they want (in Vietnam they call a cheese sandwich: ""hotdog""), I fully respect that, but I don't think that the definition of lemondade should change.

"That is just the issue... some times people will vote for some thing that is really not ethical. (As in the example you gave of slavery, and in this case, gay rights and marriage). Do we just wait for the country to ""come around"" and get used to the idea of gay marriage? Will this issue polarize our country like slavery did and lead to another civil war? So who makes the decision to over ride the voters? Who they elected to run California will not overturn the vote, so should it go to the supreme court?",1
"The most important thing for a child to have in his or her life is a stable home, especially one where they can see a loving relationship. Yes, they need role models from both men and women. They need role models from as many types of people they can. I am a lesbian and I plan on having children eventually but I'm not going to seclude them from men. I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids. It's what happens and, to an extent, it builds strength when paired with love from others. Hopefully, by the time my kids are old enough to learn what discrimination is, they world will be a bit better. And last- there are so many nameless kids in the system, why would we oppose something that puts them in loving homes?",1
"Actually its been scientifically proven that the reason people are attracted to the same sex is usually because they have more of the opposite hormones that their sex is supposed to supply. For example. Say female hormones are x's and male hormones are P's well if a male and a male are interested in each other the male produces more x's then p's. Nothing wrong with it, it's normal and it human. Nobody is born perfect and nobody is born flawless. If a man and a women are together awesome! if a women and a women are together great! if a man and a man are together then at least they can act like more of a man then most straight guys can. They aren't afraid of people who are against them they just want to be happy and go for it.",1

No child will assume a man gave birth to them if the parents explain things the way all parents do. Did you assume your father gave birth to you until your mother said she did?  It is alright if he is gay too. There is nothing wrong with being gay. Their is something wrong with judging people and telling children that their gay parents are sinners and are going to hell.  There is something wrong with laughing at a child for having two parents who love them. Any orphan would gladly take two fathers or two mothers over no parents any day of the year.",1
"What a load of pseudo-intellectual crapola. Changing the meaning of the word is NOT going to fix the problem.  Marriage is just a word. It means whatever society decides it means.

By failing to expand the definition, we are NOT collectively deriding gay love as unworthy. What a load of pseudo-intellectual crapola.",0
"1 & 2. You contradict yourself. You write off the meat is murder crowd as foolish, and then go on to say that ""Eating steak isn't morally wrong, so that's not a very good example."" Although I agree that eating steak isn't morally wrong, clearly there are some people who believe it is. Should these people have the right to stop you from eating steak? Should you have the right to stop homosexuals from doing what they do? The answer to both these questions is no.  3.  There are plenty of other good people who don't support gay marriage.   Just like there were plenty of other  good  people who were against womens suffrage or the civil rights movement or even slavery. Your point only shows that it;s socially acceptable to oppose rights for homosexuals, not that its right. The point of using the KKK was to try and show you an example of a group that is now infamous for its intolerance.   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage.   It's like arguing with a two year old, I swear!  Listen Jake, the point I was trying make is that it is socially acceptable to discriminate against gays. The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up. Your supposed to laugh not get offended (and you complain about PC people getting offended easily,   jeez )",1
"My desire for sex, whether its an instinctual need to procreate or not, primarily manifests itself emotionally. Its a statement, not a logical argument.   I can put them in standard form if you'll like. I just gave you a logical argument on why you should use condoms. I can do it for homosexuality.   1. A person should do what they enjoy, so long as it doesn't conflict with other people's justified rights.  2. A person would enjoy having sex with an available adult member of the same sex.  ---------------  3. A person should have gay sex.",1

"There are lots of binding traditions you could call ""marriage"" and Christians were far from the first to invent these. It seems silly they would be allowed to ban others from it because it's their word (not their concept).   Also marriage is a lot more than a religious tradition nowadays; you can have many different churches preform a marriage, not all of them Christian, as you can the government through a courthouse. One acceptable option would to be to completely sever the link between church and state in this regard and stop giving financial benefits to married couples; then gays would only be denied something of religious significance.   Another viable option is for Christianity to change it's views, as it has done numerous times in the past, to allow gay marriage. Yet another alternative is for Christianity to allow the gays to form a splinter religion, as has been done numerous times in the past, and this similar and affiliated religion would be able to sanction gay marriage.   In conclusion: Christians didn't invent marriage, it's not their business to police it. If they want to police it, the state shouldn't compensate and reward them for their efforts. If they still want tax breaks and financial aid, they need to drag themselves out of the stone age yet again, or otherwise allow gay churches to preform their own gay marriages, if they really want nothing to do with it.",1

"Marriage is a state-sponsored institution that gives some financial incentive for couples to be married because stable, 2 parent families raising children create a stable society. While it is obviously clear that many families do not fulfill this requirement, no homosexual couple can produce a child on their own. So maybe only 40% of hetro couples fulfill their obligation of being a good home and raising children there (I'm making this number up, but you get the idea), 0% of homosexual couples have children.  Maybe the financial incentives aren't worth it at all, in which case lets get the govt out of the marriage business (my own opinion), but there seems to be no incentive to invest in homosexual marriage. This is why I vote against it, but as I've always said, if a voting majority gives gays marriage, ok. It's really not an enormous deal.",0

They are not being discriminated against. :),0
"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.",1

"The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another.   That is exactly what I am saying.   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself   You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying. A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here.  from DOMA:  ""No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."" - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another.

"The definition of true freedom captures the essence of all contemporary debates. Whether we accept it or not, freedom has boundaries. Morality and ethic governs these boundaries. Thus, as knowledge increases, we venture beyond established limits. Understandably so, but as we enter the uncharted, morality and ethics must continue to govern us (they are the lamp to our feet). As a consequence this is where knowledge and wisdom diverge. Allowing Gays to marry is in my opinion the moral tipping point where all things deviant (which you love) would gain legitimacy. This is a knowledge driven venture only without understanding its ultimate impact on our society.",0
"At this point it seems you are being obstinate and wilfully obtuse.   Prove that homosexuality is natural.   Define natural. Regardless, Human beings are not and should not be governed by what is deemed natural.   It shows future generations what the world looks (or rather, looked) like, primarily before the advent of the camera.   It is impossible for that to be the reason for paintings before the camera, as the artists would not have known what a camera is or that it would ever be created.   Hedonism is not logical.   Why not? Pleasure is entirely logical. Conversely, a life without pleasure is completely illogical. Sex is pleasurable, and a life without that fails to conform to the primary compulsion of life - procreation. Regardless, humans are not logical creatures. We have emotions, none of which serve any logical purpose. Our society makes sex a taboo, which is illogical considering our natural urge to mate.    How are 'human rights' pleasurable?   This is implied by the displeasure of having none.",1
"I'm not very well-researched on the topic, so I'm sure someone else could answer this better than I can, but I do know that there are certain things that married couples can do more easily than non-married couples.

I mean, if marriage didn't actually help couples do anything new with each other, in a legal sense, then why would most of us get married anyway? Of course I pose this question in a legal sense.",1

"You said she should not accuse the country of oppression and I was pointing out that our country has a history of it. And as I said even though past oppression may have been worse, it does not take away from the oppression now. But you failed to respond to that point, typically.  No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.   ""In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country.""   Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, ""Is America based on majority rules?"", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just ""get over it or move to another country."" Should the slaves have just gotten over it?

"A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument   It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.    Ask me if you don't know the difference   I understand the difference. Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it. Knowledge is belief that may be truth or not but it is backed up with strong evidence. And the probability of it being truth is high. There is no guareentee that it is truth. I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.    Do you even know what ""overpopulation"" means?    lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.",0
But you are operating under a simplistic view of evolution for your argument. You even seemed to show your ignorance of the difference between a mechanism for evolution(natural selection) and the theory of evolution itself.

"Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is  not  a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of  opinion.  It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against.   The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because  he  though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response  would not have even worked  had it been, as you said, me  encouraging  him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.  Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.  Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said.    you  said that gay people were  not  discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all ""black people this"" and ""fear"" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.  You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.  As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...   http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11102139    http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/ queer-town/queer-town-the-catholic- power/    Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because  ""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?""  And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.  And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.",1
It hurts when they want to teach kids in school that. I like that we have a system and a fabric that rewards a man and women to marry. People don't want it and thats why they have petitioned to remove it from states that have made it law only on judicial reasons which is unconstitutional.,0
"Children in many cases keep marriages together   Bullshit. Show me some statistics. If anything, I would say that having kids probably puts more strain on the marriage. I have plenty of friends that have divorced parents, so unless you can show me a study that proves your point, I am going to be inclined to believe you are wrong.  I agree that having two parents makes things easier on the children, but this isn't a reason why gays shouldn't get married. In fact, studies have shown that homosexual parents are equally as capable as heterosexual parents, therefore, if a gay couple were to adopt the child would turn out better then if they had no parents.",1

"This is a touchy subject. However, I believe that it's important for a child to have been raised by a  mother  and a  father . Each parent gives his or her child different life lessons and raises a child differently. Sure, one man could act as the father and the other as the "" mother "", but I think gender is a factor in how you raise your child, no matter sexual orientation. And then there's single parents. The difference there is that they are open to dating other people, so the boyfriends or girlfriends can come into the home and help the single parent in raising his or her child.",0

"I actually know of a few, who maybe don't ""resent"" being adopted, but wished they had their actual parents, and blame a lot of their psychological problems on the fact that they weren't raised by their parents.    Only in THIS time, does this scenario hold so much value. When someone is born by an accident, and then is not wanted, and is raised poorly because of the fact. Why are adoption programs established in the first place? Because there are more people having sex that don't want children, there are more people without the means to have children, but want children, and there are more people out there suffering from bad parenting. This hasn't always been the case, see what I've said to Kukla.    The chances of ""accidentally"" having children, and the chances of not being able to care for the child, have to be higher now than any other time in history, partly due to the fact that there are just more people in general out there at this moment than any other specific time in history. If the failure rate is higher now than ever, and the number of gays raising children are higher than ever too, logically, the percent of failure has to effect the lower number, the gay adopters, more than the people having the children by accident. Also, something to conceder is, why are they failing? If it's because of the income, look at the percent of failure with a mother and father in the same income bracket than the adopter's, you will find that there is a wide gap.   Most accidental births, I'm sure, are well taken care of despite the fact that they weren't planned, more often in a higher income bracket than a lower. The people with a low income will fail, whereas the people in the higher one, even though it's accidental, will be taken care of just as well as ones raised by adopters, because they are given money, and already have the money to do so.   In all of time, there have been more straight couples with money and children than gay couples with money and children... think about it. Statistically speaking, the straight people may have failed more people over the coarse of history, but that doesn't mean that they haven't also raised more children successfully too.",0
"What a silly old argument. ""Gay people have equal opportunity to marry...to a member of the opposite sex.""  Here is an idea. Since you like equality so much, let's make it illegal for you to marry the person you love and only legal to marry who we say you can. Ya, lets give you the same ""equal opportunity to marriage"" as you want to give to gay people.  Sound like a plan?",1
"Wow, you're really grasping at straws here aren't you? Because women are mistreated and female infants are killed in India, we should ban gay marriage? Is this what you're saying? Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.  The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:  1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted. This means that less female infants would be killed and could but instead could be put up for adoption.  2) It would make genders more equal. If a woman can marry a woman and start a family without a man then this empowers women. It means that they don't need men.   Honestly I'm pretty sure that I'm not understanding you. Is this a joke? Because I can think of no other reason why you would bring up a completely irrelevant article and say homosexual marriage would exacerbate the problem. Hell, this didn't even happen in America! That doesn't make it any less of an atrocity, but it does make your entire argument irrelevant.",1

Couldn't God have designed our bodies to be a little more perfect? I'm not denying God's existence. I'm merely stating that this world wasn't directly created by God like so many people believe.

"There is nothing wrong with homosexuals and to be persecuted because of sexual orientation is wrong. If a gay couple wants a kid give them a kid. But I think that there could be consequences and pluses.   But I think that letting them adopt children would be leading those children into an extremely awkward upbringing. That would make them outcasts. Kids are extremely brutal just read A Child's Machiavelli, everything rings true. Picture your average bully not only picking on a kid because of his looks but now he has a weapon that would make that kid a total outsider to all other kids. Kids find it odd when a kid has no father or mother, or when he/she lives with his/her grandparents or are adopted to a hetero family a kid with 2 fathers or mothers doesn't fit into the mix for a proper upbringing in a peers perspective at a young age. It would all lead down a messed up life for the kid down the road he would be confused with his sexual orientation and countless other issues.  But then ,maybe all the toughness would make that kid an even better person than all the other kids that made fun of him or didn't step forward to defend him. I cannot say for sure since I have not had such an experience.  But it is a free country and if one person can adopt another person should be able to as well.",1

This is  EXACTLY  where you are wrong. Are you so dense and stupid that you can't understand simple English? If you can't, then it would be beneath me to honour you with a reply, which I have been doing for a long time and my patience is wearing thin. Knowledge is what philosophers term as  ""justified true belief"" . What this means is that to be considered ""knowledge"", a belief must be  both  justified and true. If you can't understand this, then you are truly stupid.   Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact.   Wrong. See above.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?""   You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?""   What is the ""normal""? Be specific.   I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.   As long as you are not specific, you are wrong with the definition. That is the idea of ""defining"".   Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter.   Contrary to your warped  belief , it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   it is mostly female homosexuals.   First, that is  not  what you have said. Second, prove that it is "" mostly  female homosexuals""? Finally,  so what  if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter  all  three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   However, without people, there isn't a society in existence.   This debate isn't about  propogating  homosexuality, it  is  about acceptance. I am not saying that homosexuality should be promoted. What I am saying is that they should be accepted. Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   Society cannot grow independently of population.   Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism.   What you said is that   "" all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow""  . Imperialism only occurs with  some societies ,  NOT  all societies.   An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed.   Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality.   Which is contradictory to what you have said.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law.

"No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.    Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds.   Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.    And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny.",0

"Oftentimes it's one specific issue that causes some religious people to want to splinter off and make their own similar but different (on that one issue) religion. One needs only look at the many, many branches of Christianity to see that people have a lot of different opinions on proper Christian faith and behavior. I don't see why homosexuals shouldn't be able to do the same, and have rights that other splinter churches enjoy (there are LGBT Christian churches nearby that I know of, but they cant preform a legally binding gay marriage). We allow religious people to pick-and-choose the aspects of their faith that they want to follow and don't usually revoke privileges or rights for it. You can have just about every sin in the book on your hands and still be Christian, still have a Christian marriage, but these things don't always hold true if your sin is homosexuality. I get that homosexuality, like everything else, is an abominable sin in the Christian faith, but they don't allow or deny marriage rights based on how much you sin or what your sins are. If you're a gay Christian and you want to marry another gay Christian, why can't you have a Christian marriage?   I guess I've always seen the beliefs of the church and Christians as very mailable and ever-shifting; they alter their views so they can be accepted and supported by their host community. If the Church still opposed interracial marriage, for example, priests and Christians would be mocked and ridiculed for it. Yet at one time it was a valid and accepted position for them to hold. Allowing gay marriage is just the next grudgingly progressive step this backward religion is going to take; they're going to kick, scream, and really dig their heels in, no doubt, but Christianity has been fighting a losing battle since it was created, always giving ground to civil liberties at the last possible second, before they draw too much hatred upon themselves for their bigotry.",1
"You don't need a piece of paper to define your happiness. However, you do need a piece of paper -- and be straight -- to be eligible for the considerable financial benefits given to married people. Same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.  When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benefits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marriage be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".",0

Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""   Romans 1:26-28:For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.""",0
"Wow so much ignorance and hypocrisy to address.   ""I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera""  Please observe the middle ages. That is probably an ideal time for Christians. Gays were killed. No science. Blasphemers were killed. Almost everyone was Christian. But I would hardly call it a time free of crime, pain, and suffering.  No one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks. There are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling.  A) Your friend doesn't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reason  B) Your friend lied to you  C) You lied to us.  Being homosexual is not a choice. Regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that, why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god? You guys really need to learn logic.  Marriage by the government is not a holy union. In a church it is. And that is what you guys fail to realize. No one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same-sex couples, you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you. However, according to the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, we cannot base our government off of religion. If we base marriage off of religion, how do we choose which one, maybe my religion says nobody can get married? Even if everyone in the country in Christian, which thankfully they aren't, we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy, it is not legal.  You can mince words all you want, but Christianity is a religion and atheism is not.  And proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. That's totally irrelevant, however, because it doesn't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional. You don't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you. Our system is not set up by majority rules. It is set up by majority rules with minority rights. The minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important. The framers of the constitution specifically set up the government to avoid the kind of religious and tyrannical persecution they experienced in England.",1

However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers. I believe this is the purpose of life because it is programmed in our heads.

"Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.  As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.  But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word ""marriage"". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.  If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation.   What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.  In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!  When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood.",0

Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology.

"I utterly and irrefutably agree with your view. My concern has always been the emotional, social, mental and particularly the psychological wellbeing of the child. For instance, one growing up with two fathers would merely destroy their sense of belonging. Consider the bullies out there, those who do discriminate on the basis of one’s sexuality. Although I’m against discrimination, I think it’s undoubtedly wrong to be married to someone of the same gender as you. It does in fact mentally hurt a child, to the extent where their perspective on life is altered as they age, wishing they had two heterosexual parents. They themselves would begin to ponder on whether ‘Gay marriage’ and ‘Homosexuality’ is acceptable and serves as ‘normal’. It’s so sad to see that there is a significant rise in Gay marriages, somewhat indicating humankind has lost all respect for their true purpose and ultimately, for God. The Bible, a sacred text which all knowledge is derived from, acts as a source of teaching. This teaching encapsulates the wrongness of homosexuality and places emphasis on the fact that one will not be able to inherit the kingdom of God if they are homosexual. We all know this. Although one cannot rely on the Bible to teach them absolutely EVERYTHING about life as not all is contained, we must also have common sense and recognize that gay marriage is not natural. Despite the so-called ‘love’ that supposedly exists between the two so-called ‘lovers’ who are led to believe that one of them plays the role of a ‘girl’ whilst the other wears the pants, my point is: Gay marriage does not serve to fulfil the purpose of a real marriage which is PROCREATION. Adopting a child is far worse, bringing an innocent human-being into your life to illustrate and teach to them your own wrong-doings, consequently influencing them to view it as acceptable. Please man, where’s the brains.",1
"You sated:  ""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.   If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""  My response:  Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another.   You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.  Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.  Again, you stated:   'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'  Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:  Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.  Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.  Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.  Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.  Reductio ad absurdum!  Again, you stated:  'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. '  What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.  Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities.   You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”  Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.  And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best.   The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers.",0
"Yes!!  People have no control over who they fall in love with, male or female. It is wrong for gay marriage to be illegal because it's like trying o control people's feelings and feelings can't be controlled.  Sure, many Christians find it wrong, but everyone has the freedom of choice; to choose what they want, whether it's being gay or not.",1
if you go deeper in psychology and genetics you will find that the causes of homosexuality are still unknown meaning that your argument is only a theory wish means its irrelevant and unproven.,1

"Prove that homosexuality is natural.  There is no logical reason to pain pictures - in a way, there is.

"Yet you dodge ""dancing.""   I do not dance. There is no logical purpose to dance.   Then happiness, anger, sadness, etc... are all illogical as well.   Of course. That is why I have spent years ridding myself of emotion - indeed, ever since I was a young child.   It would be logical for someone to do something that is pleasurable become it makes them happy.    Happiness is both overrated and illogical.   The only people I'm aware of that find emotions ""illogical"" are psychopaths.   I've long thought myself to belong to that 'persuasion', though aveskde disagrees.   They might be able to give you a reason why having human rights is pleasurable.   Ahh, so you are one of those humanoids who believes that humans actually deserve rights. What about animals?  Rights are overrated.",0
the same way the court decides who gets custody today... is that hard to grasp??,1
Come on you are over thinking this. It is about wat the child wants and since being gay is more acceptabel then less bulling for them i guess but saying homophobic stuff like it's disgusting thats why it's hard to live life you always have to worry about wat some one thinks. I APLUDE OPEN GAYS! THEY STAND UP TO BULLIES AND DON'T CARE WAT THEY SAY ISAY YOU GO GAY! ;),1
"Changing the definition of marriage effecting our legal system and society's view of marriage  does  have serious effects on us. If you view marriage as an important and serious institution and not something you would enter lightly without thought, then it's very important.   .  I suspect that the high rate of divorce is reflective of the light attitude people have of marriage today. It's nothing to be proud of, the goal should be to reverse this trend.",0
If your argument held water then english teachers would be the largest opponents of gay marriage.,0
thats not true. it does matter to have a couple of a male and a female.,0
"How did it fall apart? Two people are standing by their principles, in this situation no-one is going to concede victory. But it is still fun to hash it out.  The fact of the matter as I see it is your posts are tagged as No and you are disputing me so you are being bias in your criticism of the argument being had.",1
It should be allowed because it's love.   IT'S LOVE PEOPLE,1
I beg to differ. You can go down to the court house to get married fairly cheaply and quickly. Marriage is only religious if you want it to be.,1
"I shall oppose you on this subject until the day I die Jake. Being Gay is a fact, albeit not in the majority of the people born. You're right, never give in to conformity and we're trying not to! You talk about the few being louder. They have to be just to get the ear of those who can put things right. Ever hear of the Boston Tea Party? Those people were in the minority but they were absolutely right. What came from that was the fundamental right to be represented while being taxed.  What is a family? In today's world it is many things. A mother and father with children, a mother and child, a father and child, a child who has been abandoned but has been rescued through adoption or foster care and the gay couple or person whose God given right to have children has been thwarted by people like you. It's not ""We"" who have been created to be with the opposite sex. It is ""You"" and many, many others like you but what if you weren't created that way? What if you were created to be exactly what you are? Straight, Gay, Asexual and whatever else there is?  Homosexuality is not abnormal simply because you say so. You put up a debate in the last couple of weeks about wanting to read a good book. Good! Go read one about Homosexuality and how right it really is. What once was considered a malady of the mind is now a malady of the homophobe because you dare not disturb your thinking. So what that most people aren't gay? That has about as much to do with anything as most people not being born on Pitcairn Island! No one is being brainwashed here but you...especially not ""laterally.""  It goes against your beliefs and you have a right to those to those beliefs. Yes you do...but I'll tell you what Jake. In the time you've been here I have never once seen you alter anything about YOUR beliefs. Your beliefs are as old as Methuselah and you do not wish to alter them one degree by reading, interacting with or trying to understand what Gay people are or represent. We are all things, just like straight people are.   You even have the gall to bring in the Constitution of the United States. Please back-up ALL your condemnations with proof...outside of your own thoughts.",1
"1) Man+man is a marriage of equals. Ok. So what?  2) Marriage between a man and two women. That's a separate debate.  3) Marriage between a man and an android. That's a separate debate.  4) Marriage is not a right. Ok, but gay marriage still doesn't hurt anyone.  4) Marriage is not religious. Ok. So what?  5) Changing the meanings of important words can hurt. Ok. But changing the meaning of marriage to allow gays to marry doesn't hurt anyone.",1
"The argument you are making would have applied to interracial marriage when it was illegal, so acknowledge that you would have been against interracial marriage when it was illegal or admit your hypocrisy.",1
"""This does not mean I hate gays or think homosexuality is a sin. Marriage I feel should be between a man and a woman""  You fail to present any reasoning to support this position. Can we assume religion?",1
"""Homosexuality is not natural""  This is the most preposterous item I've heard in years. Are you ignorant to what is natural and not?!  Acceptance vs taboo   If you know anything about animal and human sexuality you would properly acknowledge that homosexuality has been around since the existence of sexuality. Animals display it on a daily routine. Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in ancient history, had many homosexual tendencies. (even on a more intense level of pedophilia)   As an evolving society, homosexuality was bound to get to the point it has today. Let me also add that if you knew anything about the adoption procedure and the psychological harm that those who go through adoption have to deal with, it would pale to comparison to the teasing they would go through in their schooling.  My point is that on items of sexuality it is not all monkey see monkey do.   I have so many points and so little time. I'm very happy to see the down votes. (means I'm getting to you people!)   As for your opinion, I'm not here to change it. I'm just here to point out all the fallacies in your argument.",1
It hurts any children involved who would be deprived of either a mother or a father. I would love to hear an argument that shows that either mothers or fathers are unnecessary. Haven't heard one yet. . .,0
No-one should marry!!! But gay people have the right to if they want to...,1

"Having said all of that, I know exactly how you feel because I too want something that I'm not entitled to and the courts keep on deying me.  So my arguments to you are like therapy to me because if I can create a well thought out argument against gay marriage, then I can use a similar argument to justify the court's decision to myself and this in turn eases the pain and resentment and anger that is within me.  So don't think too harshly of me. We're all in this together. We all have issues. ;)",0
"You're correct, gays can go out and get married. They have the same rights under the law as anyone else. They just choose not to and that's not discrimination.",0
I wasn't referring to any sort of law or government. That is simply what I believe.,0
Well I see where your coming from but it's not quite the same because they are attracted to the same sex.   That's why they need civil unions.,0
"We can reproduce and we do  The fact of population is that there are currently too many people for the Earth's resources to handle  Gay people represent higher adoption rates to clean up the mess of straight people, to lower the population of people having children they cant care for  Gay people have been around since the times of the Romans and will continue to exist in the future  As it is now countries like the UK, Portugal, Spain and even Pakistan have or are overtaking America on Gay rights  The Americans didn't act on Womens rights until others challenged them to  They didn't act on slavery until challenged  And they won't act on Gay rights now even though there are many gay women and black people challenging them  Gay people pay taxes, they are entitled to the same rights",1
"You want a 1 year old child in an orphanage to decide? Why not let them vote, drink, smoke, drive and do other things then... please, they are children and not old enough to make such choices! Plus, do you really think that a child would rather stay in an orphanage than be loved by 2 people in a home where they have family... even if that family is 2 men? I have friends (heterosexuals) who just adopted a 2 year old child because they cannot have kids... that child has some issues, but is  so  happy to no longer be in an orphanage!",1
"Though I agree with your position, I feel like more questions need to be asked. For instance, how old are these studies? Are they still going on?  Though I am for gay adoption, I do not think the answer is so obvious. It is stirring so much debate because gay adoption is going against the previous traditional values of American society, and any shift from one set of morals to another is bound to bring up some questions.   So, yet again, I implore others who are against gay adoption to post and give their point-of-view. I would like to keep this debate as level as possible.",1
"If you make homosexual marriage legal, then what is marriage? If we don't have a clear, stable, and defined meaning than it means nothing. If a man can marry another man, then when we get used to that what will come next? A human marrying an animal? Then what? A human marrying computers, buildings, and rocks?  My most true motive for this view is what the Bible has to say about it, but I try not to debate based on Holy Books because I'm sure many of you don't trust a word it says!",0
"""why not three men and four women. Or fathers and daughters ...""  Ah! See, now if you were true to Christian teachings, you would support that because clearly that is Biblical traditional families. Why do you question the morality of Moses? (He had sex with not one but both of his daughters.) Why do you question the entire human race from a Biblical perspective? (Noah; Adam & Eve).  I'm not asking anyone to ""approve"" my lifestyle. I'm demanding as a citizen to be treated equally, ""which I have no problem with"" because IT IS ABOUT inheritance and tax benefits.  There is no federal recognition of a legal same sex marriage even in those states that allow it. Equal taxation is denied. No one is asking you to change your precious ""traditions and institutions"". Stop acting as if you are some poor put upon person because God forbid, some human being that you don't approve of is happy. Get a life.  Let me ask you this. Do you revere your marriage so much that you have you marriage license framed and hanging in your living room, signed by everyone at your wedding? Do you keep that prominent and show it off to everyone as a testament to your commitment to another human being, whom you love greatly? Do you pass by it every day, smile, think deeply, and reaffirm that love?  No? Well, I have two gay friends who do, and they've been together for about 20 years. How dare you suggest that you somehow get to have a say in their love and commitment for each other. Who the hell asked you? No one passed judgment on your love, why do you defy Jesus himself by judging others.",1
