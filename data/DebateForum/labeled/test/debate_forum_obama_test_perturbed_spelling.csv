103,"God I love iditos someyimes.  The wars that Bush started cost about 3  trillion  dollars alone. This money was essentially wasted, in terms of the American economy. He also threw away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts (mainly for the rich), as well as deregulating the banks, causing them to rapidly spiral their risks, into what we now call 'a great big fucking recession'. Considering that he started off with a budget surplus, I hardly consider this a good record.  Then, you look at Obama. He's cut back on military spending, partially through removing troops from around the world (saving lives), as well as through straight cuts. In his first year, spending fell - overall spending growth in 4 years is lower than the inflation rate (0.4%). Obama is spending essentially the same amount as Bush did at the end of his presidency. However, due to a fucked economy, tax revenues have fallen massively, and government non-discretionary spending has risen (due to increased welfare payments).  So no, that's patently wrong.

It also shows republican drones have a very weak argument against him.   Tuesday, President Barack Obama argued that while a limited government that preserves free markets ""speaks to our rugged individualism"" as Americans, such a system ""doesn't work"" and ""has never worked"" and that Americans must look to a more activist government that taxes more, spends more and regulates more if they want to preserve the middle class.   Wow. Did you even watch the clip?!?! He was talking about trifle-down economics, and I agree with him 110%. It doesn't work. It has never worked. And also CNS News? What is that? Try a reputable news source next time or you will get crap like this.   I've heard people say governmental jobs, but how many street sweepers can you really hire.   Then you have been lied to. There are FEWER government workers now than when Obama took office.   I've also heard GM created tons of jobs, but I can't see that being too true.   They were literally on the brinks of bankruptcy. They had leveraged too much and had virtually no capital to fund their activities. After the Obama auto-bailouts, they are now the #1 car manufacturer in the world. The American auto-industry is now one of the strongest sectors of our economy, and of any economy. Time had an entire issue dedicated to the amazing post-bailout comeback of the auto-industry.

43,"yhose two links don't say that he's lying, they say that he's misrepresenting infromation... which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack Knoller.   They speak against the validness of the article, and portray good arguments. Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   I'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession, I'm talking about the very necessities of his office. In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.""   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it ""helps"".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most. Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.",1

64,"Federal regulatoin of health care should be kimited and focused  For example, individuals who are continuously covered for a specified period of time should not be denied access to insurance because of pre-existing conditions.  individuals should be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines, free from costly state benefit requirements.  Finally, individuals and small businesses should be allowed to form purchasing pools to lower insurance costs and improve choice.  Regulation can correct common failures in insurance markets, but it is often counterproductive.  Regulation places a burden on good portions of the economy, not just bad portions.  Regulations function as a hidden tax. The federal government’s own Small Business Administration placing the price tag of regulation at $1.75 trillion annually—much higher than the entire burden of individual and corporate income taxes combined.  federal agencies today have near plenary power to issue whatever regulations they see fit. Though most are nominally controlled by the president, in actual practice agencies are frequently able to act autonomously with little or no presidential oversight. The end result is an economy subject to the whims of unaccountable bureaucrats pursuing their own agendas. A new regulation can suddenly transform a profitable investment into an unprofitable one or render employees unproductive. This produces uncertainty with all its attendant economic ills.  Just because we have the worst portions of the market, and the worst portions of socialism in American healthcare, does not mean we need to go towards more socialism... These countries that you hold up as models, are more efficient than ours, but they are going away from generous social programs, because they are going broke...

41,"Yes we cab!"" roared the crowd. It was an emotoinal night for everyone. The 2008 presidential election was over. John McCain had lost to the first major party endorsed African-American presidential candidate in United States history. We finally closed troubling chapters in our history such as Mississippi burning and the civil rights marches of Selma.  Republicans, including the bewildered Religious Right, sat stunned in their seats wondering what would happen to their country. It was not because the Democratic Party was any different from the Bush Administration but because the GOP had pathetically lost its neo-conservative bully pulpit in the White House.  Democrats cheered with glee at the opportunity to take back the power that was theirs during the Clinton Glory Days. They salivated at the prospect of re-introducing neo-liberal interventionism on foreign soil and overseas markets They longed to once again crank the Dollar presses to inflate the money supply in the name of the ""poor"" this time instead of ""business"". They would gladly finish the work of the Fall of the American Empire started under the Bush Regime.  And now, the smoke and mirrors game goes on. The crooked politicians of 2009 are no different than the corrupt politicians of the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties. Crony capitalists like oil barons and railway tycoons then lined the pockets of our nation's representatives to further the goals of Big Business and destroy the wealth of American workers. Sound familiar?  President Obama had a unique opportunity in history -- and he blew it. He brought us ""change"" indeed. He slammed the Bush Doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper-drive. The rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism.  If there is one thing Americans say about Obama it is this: he cares.  He cares for the mechanic in Detroit who lost his job. He cares for the middle-aged couple living in the Hooverville tent outside Sacramento. He cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in Toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored.  But does Obama really care?  In fact, his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old Ronald Reagan playbook we knew as trickle-down economics. These days the compassionate White House grants bail-out money to financial monsters like AIG and Bank of America. There could be no better help for the American veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just aren't any more jobs. (Unless of course, you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening.) The idea is that bail-out money will sooner or later trickle-down to the great unwashed masses of Americans wondering what in Sam Hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts.  It may only be a drop of financial bail-out -- but hey it trickled down. Next up, bread lines!  The truth is that the White House allowed corporate giant CEOs to loot and pilfer the public treasury. This Administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from Baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at Guantanamo Bay.  The left-right political paradigm in this country is a sham. (Sorry to disappoint my fellow Evangelical Christians.) Both parties have proven to be Big Business, Big Government warmongers. For those who actually wished McCain had been elected just think about this: the GOP would have put up no opposition to the new President's Stimulus Package and would have rammed through trillions more in ""help"" for America.  So there you have it. President Obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal -- and all with a smile.  How is the left-right scenario a sham? Consider the following.  The gay rights issue is a political distraction. Stem cell research? Just more Big Research pork-barrel spending. Abortion? It's the political Gordian Knot that requires even the most astute of political science majors to bust a gut if they dare try to untie it. The so-called immigration invasion? A typical act of sensational yellow journalism that says, ""Look over there, Bubba! It ain't your own government stealin' your hard-earned dollars, it's them Mexicans lookin' for revenge and dishwasher jobs since the Alamo!"" Sorry, Pat Buchanan, the ""Death of the West"" comes from the corruption in our government, not the immigrants heading back home in record numbers.  What are the real issues of post-election America? For starters, the destruction of individual wealth in this country, save for the high upper class. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the Great Depression and will take decades to recover. There is no need for a conspiracy theory here -- only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves.  We must not waste time. We must move our already-compromised and over-valued U.S. Dollars into assets of real value. This does not include real estate unless you're buying ten cents or less on the high-priced dollar. Forget your 401(k), pensions and your annuities. Unless you can take your money out, they are toast. The stock market is one toxic graveyard, particularly finance shares. Dump them. Invest in precious metals, food supply, cigarettes, alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the Dollar collapses.  Consider buying silver, palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex.com. I personally recommend silverbullion.com because I support the goals of the owner Jason Hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange. Remember, that despite the U.S. Treasury's naked assertions, the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves the right of individual States to mint legal tender coins so long as they're gold or silver.  When the dollar collapses, I do not think that New York City will burn or that the United States will come to an immediate end. But if it did, the blame must rest entirely on Barack Obama and his Congressional Criminal Syndicate.  Some might here criticize me as being unfair. After all, George W. Bush The Evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars, his blatant lies to stir Americans to bloodshed, his deliberate obstruction to the 9/11 Commission, his last-minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions, his economic tinkering with interest rates, his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children, his doubling of the national debt, et cetera, et cetera.  But let me be clear about this. George W. Bush is a public menace. He and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes. But that will never happen under an Obama Presidency, in spite of the President's left-leaning brand of crony capitalism. The Truth Commission currently at play in the Congress is merely a circus show to fool Americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture, invasion, occupation, mayhem, pillaging, looting, rape, pollution, perjury, bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war.  Every moment that the Obama Administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former Administration, it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new President has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his Democratic base and the American voter. The White House today has continued in the same deadly bait-and-switch tactics of the former Village Idiot-In-Chief. Additionally, Obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the ""War and Bankers Party"" on both sides of the aisle.  For a President to vociferously take on Rush Limbaugh the GOP's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal. Besides the fact that the Democrats want to point out the weakness of the GOP's leadership vacuum, Obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution in light of the economic crisis. Are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian Hugo Chavez, who is a regular media personality, cheer Obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries?  Evangelical Christian radio stations are scared stiff about the Democratic-led Congress reviving restrictions on Americans to share their religious opinions over the people's airwaves. And they should be concerned. (I particularly enjoy my local station.) After all, the same kind of government that monitors, censors, filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals, plunders and coerces its own people. One look at China's control of the internet and Google's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian's skin crawl. Reports that Australia is considering Chinese-style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves.  So why is President Obama responsible for our economic debacle?  Because it's the first rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. If he didn't like the prospect of being stuck with the mess of his predecessor he should have remained in the Senate or considered an honest living like working for AIG or Lehmann Brothers. Obama has not only repeated the same unconstitutional trespasses of Bush II, but he actually increased the amount of corporate welfare to the Bank Barons. Obama turned a blind eye to the Federal Reserve's arbitrary usury practice through the printing of increasingly worthless U.S. Dollars.  Are we really going to see a Dow Jones 4000? The answer is regrettably yes -- and then some. There are economic forces at play that will no longer be ignored or manipulated. Human behavior will always gravitate towards self-preservation and the protection of our future generations through wealth-building, capital, production and labor. All the paper fiat money and government spending in the world can never stop that or help this economic disaster recover without drastic corrections to our own cursed speculative market. The times of fast and easy money are over.  President Obama has not even finished his first year in office and I must already call him out as one of the worst Executives ever in the history of our Republic. Bush II is close behind. Every GOP and Democratic elected leader that voted for any of these crooked bail-outs deserves a one-way ticket to an electoral defeat. Should state law allow it, a public tar-and-feathering might be in order.  When our country faced economic dangers, depressionary woes and international volatility let it be said that President Obama failed to protect us from the corruption of Congress, the indifference of the Judiciary and the foolishness of the People. Let it be said that he abandoned his post to uphold the Constitution. Let it be said that he whored his policies and his office for the rich and powerful, both foreign and domestic. Let it be said that we voted for change and all we got was the Raw Deal of the Obama Failure obama is a failure",0

Hey you got to check this out.....its hilarious and shows how stupid Obama REALLY IS, that he can't say anything without a prompter. Also shows his educational level.    http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=QxXh6ZWfbDg    ""The bomb (singular) that fell on Pearl Harbor.""  ""I had an uncle who was part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps."" The problem being...American troops did not liberate Aucshwitz, the Soviet Read Army did.  ""On this memorial day as this nation honors its unbroken line of fallen heros, I see many of them here today."" But doesn't Memorial day honor the dead, those who served and died WHILE IN MILITARY SERVICE ?  And how could 1965 events result in a 1961 birth? Obama the storyteller. Does not need teleprompter to feed lies.  And then when he talked about Hugo Chavez (his close friend) he got dates wrong when accusing Bush of things....when he was not even president, Clinton was.   Then there is his expertise in geography.   ""In the last fifteen months...we have traveled to every corner of the United States. I have traveled to , lets see....uh....57 states with one left to go...with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii. So total that up.....57+1+1+ 1 left to go. ....60 American states wow...what a Harvard education he got.   And he pronounces Massatoosits........just like that.   ""Eau Claire is a beautiful state"" I believe its a city, he better check his map or better yet fire his speech writer.   He doesn't even know what states border eachother.   And in Sioux Falls South Dakota......at a rally he calls them Siox CITY. He doesn't even know the difference.   So he can't get facts straight how about his knowledge of figures?  Like the tragedy in Kansas where he said the entire town was wiped out 10,000 people died. Only twelve died.   He is simply an idot..who got elected by people who did not care what changes he made.   Then he says that he will be serving as president for 10 years. He doesn't even know how long a term is.   And show me one politician ever....that looks more like a boob than he does....in this video of him at the town hall meeting.  He doesn't even know the facts..........can't present them and people don't seem to care...

They used the escrow funds to repay their outstanding balance. I grant you full justification for complaining about the money going to  any company  to begin with. That's fine.

It's cliche to say this but it's true; voting for a third party or abstaining is throwing your vote away when you have the opportunity to vote for the better of 2 candidates.  It's a losing situation since voting for a third party raises the numbers for next time and encourages more voters to have another option.  Even though I disagree with the President Obama's positions, he really wasn't given a good start. The housing bubble wrecked the economy. War is actually a revenue and employment generator. We really didn't get to see whatever potential he brought to the table.  I feel that he has been given too much support by a select few with too much financial and media influence. You can buy your way into an elected position or have others pay for you.  Lastly, as much as I don't want him to serve a second term, I think that he will most likely win.

12,"I think you contradicted yoruself.   I'm sure you think tjat, but your still wrong.   If the creation of jobs is interchangeable with the creation of wealth, then it must follow that the government creates jobs (and wealth) whenever it creates new organisations   Answer these questions.  How is government funded? Does government possess any assets without taxation? Does government have any financial spending power without taxation?  Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.   Those are not transferred jobs because there was never a private sector equivalent.   There is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the provided by private sector through law.   They produce technologies and monuments which are too expensive for corporations to create   Again, you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services. The private sector may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as NASA or USPS.  All of the employees who work at NASA or Defense, whose money is it that they are using? Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money came from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   Taxation takes surplus wealth from producers and uses it to fund the creation of these things.   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.  For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. Now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   The great depression was caused by insider trading and corruption of the stock market.   No, The Great Depression was caused by failure in central bankers.    Milton    Milton    If the market works like Natural Selection, and businesses behave like animals, then Keynesian policy would merely be that which applies artificial pressure to the evolution of business. If this is true, then it follows that the market's behaviours can be changed to correct social problems like unemployment.  This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   If this is true, then private businesses may never create a net addition to employment opportunities because they produce a heavier burden on other private businesses and employees, because a private business ""charges money for a service (same as tax), borrows money (loans), and prints coupons (similar to printing money practically).""   OH MY GOD. Anyway. What Next?   What I would be interested in hearing is how a tax is different from a sale, practically speaking. I'm not interested in how you're compelled to pay tax, because force is irrelevant to the immediate equation, which is the creation of jobs (and wealth) through the trading of money.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.  For instance, if a man wants to sell lemonade, he will get a loan from somewhere of 5 dollars. So, over the course of the summer, the man makes 15 dollars in revenue, but he must pay back the 5 dollars in loan, and now he has a profit of 10 dollars where he created new wealth and a job.  However, if government wants to sell lemonade, it must tax the man 5 dollars because it can't invest in anyone that of which it does not own because that is what it cost him to produce, so now, the child only only has a profit of 5 dollars, so the output is still 15 dollars, but it was transferred from private to public sector. Then, the 5 dollars that the government took, he could have reinvested and hired a partner to grow.   In the discussion about economics, what matters is that money changes hands.   And that money is who does the money belong to.   Those state sales permits and laws which prohibit business startup are usually motivated by business interests who wish to stifle competitors.   This is what I have been saying time and time again.   It's how capitalism works in democracy.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Right. We also needed it, since our healthcare coverage is so poor in this country.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.  If you wanted more expensive coverage, that is what you got. Congrats.   Government-funded research exists because most research is costly and unprofitable to the private market.   Never said that it is for only profit market. Research should be non profit.  Mayo Clinic is one of the most respected nonprofit medical research organizations in the world.   Polio's researchers and early efforts to make a vaccine used a similar lack of ethics: 3000 children were injected with an unsuccessful mixture which caused allergic reactions in some of them.    Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many.  REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.   Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   government takes over where private industry would fail or be less successful.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   As to the stem cells: you can thank Bush for regulating stem cells in the first place. Obama rescinded his laws.   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   It didn't, and wouldn't ask, as long as you didn't provide it. However what happened was that many officers and recruits were discharged annually because they were spotted in gay clubs on shoreleave, or ""outed"" by malicious coworkers.   Again, this resorts to bad government military policy because before, you could get dishonorable discharge for being gay. This type of policy is stupid.    I'm not sympathetic for big business.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   I think it does an admirable job handling the roads, sewers, water, schools, medical research, space programs, and research.   Well, Great! I am so glad that you feel proud of the progress that you support.    I certainly know that only a state could afford a project as big as the Large Hadron Collider.   I am certain that one man, Branson, will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks. Maybe, space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it.  By the way, you gave me a headache.",0

It doesn't alleviate or address the root of the problem.   Why has this country only gone further in debt?   Because we're spending trillions of dollars on a war with no end in sight, and the housing bubble collapsed along with our domestic automotive industry. Did you know Bush was the only president in history to cut taxes during a time of war? Where were his financial advisers when that decision was made?

Instead of focusing on jobs and the economy, Obama is worried about Health Care (I.E. How do you tax the rich and middle class when they are losing their jobs) and Cap n Trade (if you tax businesses, they will just lay off more people in order to pay the tax) two things that will only make the economic problems worse. In addition, stop blaming Bush and the Republicans solely for this mess. Much of the problem was created by Democratic led efforts to force banks to loan to individuals who were nowhere near credit worthy (Obama was once a lawyer who sued banks to make loans to people who could never pay them back). Maybe if you took your partisan blinders off and did some research yourself, you will see that we have elected one heck of an incompetent liberal as President, one who promised to do things differently and then went ahead and did (is doing) things the same old way they were done in the past, with more gusto than any of his predecessors.",0

Firstly you didn’t distribute your subject, economists. And in response I rationally supposed that you meant  some  economists. For no man in his right mind would make the error of supposing that all economists agree. Furthermore, I even granted you the supposition that you were referring to the consensus opinion of economists concerning employment of 2010.   Secondly, no question I asked you remotely hints at suggesting that all economists are nit-wits. I repeatedly asked questions that implicated  only some  economists, and never could it be rationally asserted that I implicated  all  economists.   If you disagree, then consider the following example.  Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.  A contrary rebuttal: Not all economists expect employment to be back the end of 2010.  Finally, demonstrate to me how any question I posed in my original post implicated all economists; for you certainly responded as though I had.  Moving on…   You refer to conservative ideologues, and then imply they are not rational people.  All US economists are conservative ideologues. Why? Because all US economists want to conserve the free-market capitalism of the US which they believe to be perfect or near perfect. Yet, most economists supported the abandonment of free market principles for the sake of capitalism as a means to conserve capitalism. So, who is rational, the economists who protected their ideological view, or the economists who supported the reign of free-market principles.   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor I can’t believe any person would use the opinion of the same as a premise of an argument. Albeit, the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.    My evidence: Reality! Why? If the track record of economists was as worthy of policy as you assert then the economy of the US would not be so fucked up as it is now. Economic forecasts are intended to preclude the mess that we are currently struggling with.  Shall I drive that point further?  And the reason, I suppose, that my post was up-voted multiple times is because, believe it or not, I spoke of that which they too are witness. And like me, they too have lived long enough to know that an economist predicts so far into the future that most men are not likely to remember the previous forecast of a year ago. Yet, if there are some who do remember, I assure you that the same economists will provide an explanation of why their forecast was wrong.   Shall I continue with the remainder of our correspondence?  (Better to be pissed off than pissed on.)   Oops, I almost forgot!  Don’t ask me (implicitly) to divine the un-employment rate of the US for 2010 as an evidence of why the consensus opinion of economists is wrong!   They were wrong about this year’s rate of un-employment and I have no reason to believe they can foresee next year’s rate.",0

When the representatives finish debating and come to some kind of concession, a bill will be proposed for legislation, voted on and the President  will then  review it, sign on or veto it for another round of debate. It would be pointless for the President to read all of the bills before they are up for legislation.

Government-run anything that was privately owned before Obama came to office is a good example. I'm not saying that he is going to be the one that sends America into socialism. He may be a fluke, or he may be just the first step into the fears of the majority of American people.",0
37,"Becayse everyone who disagrees with you msut not be involved in reality   No, you can disagree. I'm talking about the ridiculous hatred... as evidenced by the tag ""fuck him"" and basically every insane tea party.  1. okay so you hate him for taxes he hasn't raised... that makes sense ._.  2. the f-22 program wasn't a kick in the balls at all. It was a billion dollar program for planes the military does not use only kept alive because senators in respective states that made the planes have been too week to support cutting the program. And that the rate of our deficit increase has slowed since Obama took office, and our GDP increased.  3. It will actually bring everyone's cost down, including those who pay for it, including you if you pay for it. Under the current system we pay the most, including you, for the 33rd ranked healthcare in the world. It is a retarded system and had to be changed and Obama has been the only President strong enough to do such.  4. Again, so in spite of the chart I linked clearly showing the job situation has steadily improved since Obama has been in office, you choose to hate him based on some vague future fear fully imagined in your fevered head. And I'm sure you blame Bush's job loss on Clinton, makes perfect sense ._.  5. Wow, that's amazing, don't let other conservatives hear you give him credit for something, they'll lynch or pray for your soul or exorcise you or some other crazy ass thing.  Next section:  This is to point out that he's doing stuff not assoiciated with sacrificing kittens to satan or speaking to Hitler's ghost about ways of turning America into a socialist nation (that doesn't make sense on purpose).

34,"he's making all these promides and yet he has not fulfilled any of tehm!   He just passed Healthcare reform, which is actually historically amazing, job loss has slowed, and our economy is improving.  I think he's done just about the best that is realistically possible in this short amount of time in any representative republic.   Lots of people who voted for him our now just realizing that maybe his isn't so good after all   Actually his approval rating is still very high for any president during a recession. If an election was held today he would beat any generic Republican candidate. It's Congress I think you are thinking of when you imply people are upset.   The major #1 reason he became president was because most people voted for him because he was going to be the first black president (not being racist)   Statistically the total number of African voters who showed up for this election, who have not in previous elections, adds up to around 1% of the entire voting population. Considering he won by a greater margin than any candidate in recent history pretty much proves race did not play a role.  The reason he actually won by more than Bill Clinton, the last Democratic President, is because there was a greater overall turnout.  A greater turnout always leads to a democratic victory, because the majority of people who usually would not vote are liberal while conservatives almost always vote.  I'm not sure where you are getting your information in recent debates, but you seem to have a very shallow world view.",1

135,"In short, yes. Compared to losong thousands of jobs, losing billinos in personal and corporate tax revenue, and spending billions in welfare to support unemployed workers.   Considering that you are only looking at what is seen and not unseen. However, Ford maybe part of the unseen considering it didn't take a bailout, and it is still in business.  Losing of jobs would have been lost, but if an adjustable and corrective market, these people would have adapted.  As aforementioned, this $14 billion dollars is only estimates done by government, and government lie to fit thier agenda.   So, the real cost of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts demonstrate this.  A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has zero credibility. It pegged likely taxpayer losses in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts at $25 billion. For those with a sense of history, it is worth remembering that the S&L;bailout had a $160 billion price tag. The numbers diverge so far from reality as to be laugh-out-loud funny. Funny, that is, except that the CBO estimate demonstrates a willful disconnect with the actual consequences of federal government actions.  As demonstrated below, the real cost of the bailouts will easily exceed $1.3 trillion. In fact, the real cost is likely to range between $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and is not unlikely to reach $2.5 trillion.   Our only hope is to (1) accept up front a twenty-percent fall in American living standards for a people living beyond their means for the past twenty-five years on the delusions made possible by fiat money, and (2) simultaneously discipline the creature from Jekyll Island, a.k.a. the Federal Reserve System, not to create new money just to prop up asset-price bubbles. Mises    Ask Ford who didn't even take a bailout if it was worth it (in the story you linked to) to preserve the market and their supplier base, etc.   The CEO of Ford doesn't even understand that his own company one who didn't take the bailout is still in business because of good past decisions.   Then why wouldn't Bush claim the credit? and how was he releasing videos discussing current events?   None of which are actually links to any substantial evidence that he was still live.   and mandate coverage for the sick, increased access to preventative care, help prevent/detect fraud, stop rescissions of insurance when insurance companies find out your sick, etc.   Which is the reasons for double for less coverage, worse outcomes and medical bills that contributed to bankruptcies.   This plan is not a single payer government run plan like medicare - it sets the rules of the road and then lets companies compete   Actually, that is the eventual plan because in order to crowd out business, government first regulates it to death, then the whole economies of scale and natural monopoly come abroad, then government takes over.  By the way, the article didn't work.",0

126,"""Sure, he should be granted creidt for instituting progrwss towards socialism.""  What is wrong with a de-centralized planned economy? It is not taking away your democracy. Rather, it encourages more democracy.  In our current capitalist societies, 5% of the population controls 95% of the nations wealth. A nation that disproportionate sounds more like a caste system, not a democracy  A de-centralised planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of worker cooperatives; planning of production is done from the bottom up by local worker councils in a democratic manner  In other words, giving people MORE freedom.  Do you hate freedom?  or just the word 'socialist'?  ""Sure, to a certain degree. Only because of bad government policy.""  Yes, but not HIS bad government policies.

Their counterparts, who seem to receive a lot of media attention, universally and unanimously always see the US economy through rose-colored glasses. Coincidently, they are the same economists whose opinions make headline news and whose opinions are sought by politicians.   However, the economists I named are extremely wary of the gigantic stimuli of the world’s governments and Central banks ( the stimuli: The race to debase the worlds currencies).

Obama gave a speech this past summer on the war and he mentioned that the war has been costing our country about $10 billion per year and I was floored by that because I think that the money can be used towards better things such as helping students pay off loans, providing jobs for Americans, putting food in people's mouths, helping people get their homes back, etc.    I also can't believe that although so many people voted Obama into office, that so many people such as in the house of representatives and/or senate have vetoed his economic proposals which were clearly created to help ""the little guys"" like me -poor college educated people. That just don't make sense to me, it looks like they're trying to prove a negative point such as a black guy couldn't cut it as president.

Bush is the equivalent of this in some measure, however insofar as his response to 911 and the crediting the wars, he made the situation worse, not that we should not have responded to the attacks but it was how we did it - shaving a bit off the constitution and committing to two ~10 year wars on borrowed money.   -Blaming Obama for how things are now is kind of like yelling at the person trying desperately to catch all of the shit flying off the fan after it hit and blaming him for missing a few of the pieces.-   Bush had to deal with the terrorist threat which was thrust upon him but i think that how he handled that was less optimal than how Obama has handled things since he took over. I am going to vote for him again in the coming election because he is our best chance and has done a good job thus far - just look at the job growth - the sluggishness of the markets and this effect on job growth and economic prosperity has nothing to do with him and his efficacy as a president - the conditions of our economic environment both domestically and internationally are the biggest influence in our slow recovery   Insofar as the economy goes, Bush didnt cause the collapse, but he did increase the national debt for these two not fully thought out wars (which we havent really won even though we have made some significant positive changes in the region).   Obama's policies reflect what more people want and is the only logical choice for the next presidentail term. (i am an independent with liberal inclinations)",1
