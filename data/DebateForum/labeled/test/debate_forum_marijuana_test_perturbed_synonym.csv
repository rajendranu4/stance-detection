1,"Hooraaah. But seriously, it don't harm no one but the smoker, and that is really debatable too. It even has medicinal benefit. Its way safer than alcohol, which we still have established by or founded upon law or official or accepted rules after repealing prohibition. And ending the ban would mean ending cruel mandatory sentencing that ruins so many young peoples lives. Be wise. Legalize.",1
2,"No, the only reason it should be legalized is for it's medical benefits, it should  never  be legalized to the public. And yes, I know that the health effects are associated with a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics are prepared are significant less dangerous than other a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics, but that doesn't make the a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic  good .",1

4,"I support allowed by official rulesizing a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared, because those countries that have a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared allowed by official rules have less problems with schedule 1 drugs. What happens in the US is that those who do smoke a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared get caught with it and get put on probation. While they are on probation that start using Schedule 1 drugs like Cocaine, which exits your system in no more than 72hrs. This is why a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared is a gateway drug. For those who do not smoke a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared, I don't think that making it allowed by official rules would make much of a difference. Marijuana is like cigarettes being so easy to come by that if you wanted to smoke it you would go get you some. By allowed by official rulesizing a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared maybe some of our tax money used to keep those in prison for having a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared could go towards something better, like education.",1

7,"I'll clear it up a bit:  First of all, an increase in cannabis users isn't a bad thing, but thats a different argument. If it were bad, though, it's only happening as a side affect of laws to begin with. Also, just because something is bad in the short term, doesn't mean it can't have long term beneficial side affects.  Also, the the system or form by which a community or other political unit is governed doesn't want that. But it still happens. Interracial a close and intimate union was illegal.

9,"Do you have any evidence that legalizing the most commonly used illicit drug would cause a significant increase in the most commonly used illicit drug use? And don't try to ""But by golly it's common sense don't cha know.""  Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk. And much less dangerous than driving while texting. Unlike you I am actually going to cite a study, by the United States Department of Transportation no less:  “This report concerns the effects of the most commonly used illicit drug smoking on actual driving performance. … This program of research has shown that the most commonly used illicit drug, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of the most commonly used illicit drug retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a consequence, THC’s adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.”  REFERENCE: W. Hindrik and J. Robbe and J. O’Hanlon. 1993. Marijuana and actual driving performance. Washington, DC: US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Report No. DOT HS 808 078.  I am by no means suggested that it should be legal to drive high. I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.  Marijuana legalized =&gt; More the body of citizens of a state or country use the most commonly used illicit drug =&gt; More the body of citizens of a state or country drive high =&gt; There will be many more deaths as a result  Hypothetically speaking even if the most commonly used illicit drug was proven to cause as much driving impairment as alcohol, this would still not be grounds for it to be illegal. One of the most dangerous things to do while driving is sleeping. But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.  Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of the most commonly used illicit drug.",1
10,"if it's legal it means there will be more of it, more any group of human beings collectively smoking it, and more problems associated with it. It's been proven that marijuana affects short-term memory and motor skills, and gets stored in the fatty tissue for up to 10 days or longer.  Children can already get it but if it's legal they will get even more of it. There will be no control of it because it can be grown.  Therefore it can't be taxed.  Using the ""medicinal value"" isn't a good excuse because they can isolate the medicinal value of the plant from the mind-altering part.  Being illegal has been somewhat of a deterrant but if we take off the deterrant more any group of human beings collectively will be stoned more often. (take abortion for example). More of it around equals more children ggetting ahold of it. Is this what you want?  More any group of human beings collectively getting stoned more often means the chance of them coming to work high. This creates a safety issue for EVERYONE, including the quality of any products that come from that company. Do you want to be driving a car put together by a stoner?  If you own a business would you hire someone who is a daily pot smoker? Your insurance company would dump you quick if that's the case. That's why they implement a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic screening at the work place. The insurance companies are behind it.

14,"Yes.   Unfortunately, President Obama has lied to us all. He says that he's willing to keep the organization that is the governing authority of a political unit open and address issues that we find the most important. So far, the number one concern brought up by the internet is the legalization of marijuana, and every time he finds a way to dodge it. The largest petition on his website and they basically tell us that they're going to do nothing and will not give us a straight answer on why.  Obama reminds me of Reagan, except that Reagan just didn't like weed and never said that he would address our concerns when we brought them up (especially in such numbers).   No, more like Nixon, a liar who thinks that the president should have far more powers than delegated by the Constitution.  Okay, a rant about Obama. I feel like I need to get my negative feelings out every once in a while in small numbers (as opposed to just being objective all the time). And since weed has been brought up on this site so many times, why not this debate?",1
15,No it should not be legalized because weed is bad for your body and its not healthy. Why should this kind of a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic be legalized its stupid to the any group of human beings collectively who want to smoke or use weed,0
16,NO NO NO.It is a drug. any group of human beings collectively think chocane or steroids are good for them but it is terrible. It causes negative effects on the human body.

Just like with Tobacco, when Cannabis is legalized and FDA regulated, I can promise you the commercialized Marijuana product will be just as laden with polutants, chemicals and pure garbage as cigarettes are. It will become more expensive because there will be a tax on it, just as there is with tobacco and alcohol. It will become another government controlled commodity.   That's why it's not legal.   People die from drinking home made alcohol/moonshine. That has to be regulated, period. Tobacco isn't addictive and isn't as satisfying or nerve calming without all the additives, hence it's alteration from natural form.

41,"I think you aren't well educated on what cannabis can actually do for society.  Did you know that if cannabis were legalized that it could replace the lumber industry with a renewable, green house resource? It requires no pesticides to grow, the pesticides companies don't like that. Big lumber are the guys who got the crop made illegal back in 1937. Crashes under impairment would likely go down, as many bars might adopt the most commonly used illicit a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic instead of alcohol. Orp people might start smoking instead of drinking. Studies have shown that impairment while driving (while not encouraged ,and should have a limit, like alcohol. Keep in mind we didn't develop one before re-legalizing it in 1937.) Other studies show that cannabis going illegal at the same time alcohol became legal again was a gift to organized crime.  See, organized crime didn't exist the way it did (or at all) before alcohol prohibition. That literally changed the face of our nation. Marijuana and other a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic prohibition changed everything as well. It (the most commonly used illicit a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic) is responsible for 70% of Drug Cartel income. We can end that with legalization.  Industrial benefits of hemp: Can make 2x4 and other building material that is 2-4x stronger than wood. Lasts longer.  25,000 different products, 5,000 known textiles (That was in 1938!). They are looking into making polymer with it. Like those high grade plastics used in, well, almost everything. From guns to blow dryers, etc. etc. This would make a more environmentally-friendly version.  Same with paper, our Constitution is written on hemp paper. George Washington smoked hemp, and grew it, even telling others to do it. Benjamin Franklin had a hemp paper mill. And news press. Hemp paper is the highest quality paper in the world. And completely renewable and eco-friendly. Industrial hemp can be grown en-mass with very little THC, making thieves unlikely. Plus it could be grown as a number one cash crop from Cali to Utah to Nebraska and most of the Bible-belt states.  Did I mention you can build the body for a car using hemp polymer? Even space shuttles and planes! Then you can fuel them using hemp-fuel that has ZERO carbon emissions.  ""Why isn't it legal if it's so great?"" You ask? Well, it's simple. Big biz, Pharm, Tobacco (although they will be changing their mind, surely), alcohol, lumber, oil, people who in the pocket of the cartels, etc. Don't want that. Enough of them got enough people tricked to keep this going for years.  Recent tests also show that smoking or inhaling, or otherwise ingesting cannabis can increase your brain cell growth. In 40 years of constant usage no user of just the most commonly used illicit a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic has ever gotten cancer or otherwise ill effects. Something would have shown up.  Dr. Lester Grinspoon, MD  Professor Emeritus, Harvard Medical School  ""There are no deaths from cannabis""  -Can be seen in the documentary ""The Union: The Business of Getting High""  Watch that on TopDocumentryFilms.com and then research and judge for yourself.

46,"The answer to the question, does the most commonly used illicit drug effect the brain? Marijuana does not effect the brain in damage, but it can alter in functions. Marijuana effects the perception of time, distance, and speed. It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of the most commonly used illicit drug, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ""Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness."" So, when the most commonly used illicit drug disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, ""depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy."" 123helpme.com  This make you want to smoke mary? :) cus it certainly doesnt apeal to me.",0

Marijuana causes lethargy, which greatly decreases ""dangerous activities"". Someone who is high on Marijuana is not going to rob a bank, or steal a car, however there is a good chance they will sit on the couch and stare in amazement as a piece of lint floats by, or watch a movie about talking animals.   But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next).   Heavy long term usage can impair short-term memory, outside of that there really isn't any. Drinking bleach isn't all that good, yet it is not illegal.

People DONT go through the most commonly used illicit drug withdraws, any group of human beings collectively can go through caffeine withdraws. Marijuana is less addictive than caffeine, which is why your statement that they ""need to get their fix"" is incredibly asinine. You obviously don't know anything about the most commonly used illicit drug, which is funny because you want it to be illegal.  Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate any group of human beings collectively, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.  Prohibition obviously doesn't work, which is why so many any group of human beings collectively still do the most commonly used illicit drug, many any group of human beings collectively are sitting behind bars (costing taxpayer dollars) who should not be there in the first place.

Alcohol is also very ilestablished by or founded upon law or official or accepted rules. There are thousands of deaths every year from tobacco and alcohol, yet there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana. Unless you support making cigarettes and alcohol ilestablished by or founded upon law or official or accepted rules, your position is not logically consistent.  Furthermore your assumption that any group of human beings collectively who smoke pot are not productive members of society is simply not the case. 50% of the population has smoked marijuana at least one time. And the past three presidents have admitted to smoking pot. You can very easily be a very successful habitual smoker, but it is far more difficult to be a fully functional alcoholic. Yet once again I doubt you support prohibition of alcohol.  Your argument is based upon incorrect assumptions and contradictions. Try again.",1
60,"I will argue first from a practical position, then philosophical, then historical.  Marijuana is not dangerous. There has been a death recorded due to marijuana. The LD50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high. Far higher. You can reasonably say it is so high, it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana. Also marijuana does not make you stupid. The reason any group of human beings collectively think this, is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen. When you die from a lack of oxygen, your brain cells die. The severe errors in the study, however, were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid. They have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke. A UCLA study found no link. The gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana. Because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers, they are exposed to harder, dangerous drugs. If marijuana was able to be sold in stores, this would not happen. Legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children. According to many studies, it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol. This is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for IDs. However, because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot. The legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy. We spend billions of dollars each year to keep any group of human beings collectively in prison because they like to get high and relax. Additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation. It is the number one cash crop in California for example. ~60% of the money of Mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the US. Severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the United States as well as Mexico, which would help improve Mexico's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the United States.  The government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else. It is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner, but I guarantee that it's much better for both you and a formal association of any group of human beings collectively with similar interests that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner. Here's a more reasonable example: Should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend? This is much more harmful than marijuana, and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death. The bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism. Where do you draw the line? Do we monitor any group of human beings collectively's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure any group of human beings collectively are productive and that they get promoted? Do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you? Do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because any group of human beings collectively have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana? The answer is no. Adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves. We do not live in a ""nanny-state"" as Ron Paul puts it.  Many any group of human beings collectively assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it. This simply isn't true. The first marijuana laws in the United States forced any group of human beings collectively to grow marijuana during colonial times. Marijuana became illegal for a few reasons. One was due to extreme anti-Latino and anti-black sentiment. People were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white a formal association of any group of human beings collectively with similar interests especially due to marijuana. The ""reefer madness"" campaign created undue hysteria. Yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role. In fact President Nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal.  http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/ Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm    The next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal. Again there are a few reasons. What kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism. By this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana, that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal, they will most likely cite things that simply aren't true. Additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge. Companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal. They don't want competition. Why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive? Many any group of human beings collectively underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy. The alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti-drug and anti-marijuana advertisements and programs. The goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs, its to stop you from doing drugs that they don't sell you. Also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the United States. Just like the tobacco and alcohol companies, pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress. Marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health. It combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions, and has no side effects. Compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs. It has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects. Thousands of any group of human beings collectively die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs.  As I hope you can see, the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels. Making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids, keep any group of human beings collectively away from dangerous hard drugs, and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives.",1

I want to see these studies. There are a lot of jobs that require the body of citizens of a state or country to stay active for long periods of time, I don't see them handing out weed and duritos and telling the body of citizens of a state or country to take an enjoyable break.

""Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy the body of citizens of a state or country are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect the body of citizens of a state or country to operate without leisure time.""   This is hilarious.

So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals.""   I am being hypocritical, but that's not the point. Leisure doesn't require marijuana, or any other drug. Contributing an argument is anything but leisure.   ""But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through ilof or relating to jurisprudence channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a of or relating to jurisprudence substance (Alcohol) in my spare time. Decriminalization is not enough.

You'd still have the most commonly used illicit drug as a illegal a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic and the most significant deterrents against its use would be removed. Instead we should legalize the most commonly used illicit drug and put heavy taxes on it, similar to those levied on Alcohol and Tobacco.

77,"Legalizing pot alone would not end the war on a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics.

This sounds absurd, I know, but think of the lives saved by doing this. Underground sex trades, the biggest Mafia's in the world, petty cold criminals- they're all run by a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics. In other words, its the law thats allowing these criminals to be what they are. If there were no law against a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics, if all a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics were run through a license, and sold legally, there would be a whole hell of a lot less murders, theft, prostitution, spreading of disease, deaths, and for most, it would shut down the worlds biggest criminal operations which thrive on selling illegal a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics.

Inevitable point: If you don't like the health risk of Mary Jane, don't smoke it. But when you jail hundreds, maybe thousands, of any group of human beings collectively a year for smoking a a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic that is harmless in comparison to alcohol and tobacco, then your laws have a serious problem.   Illegal marijuana is as inefficient as Prohibition. The difference is that the punishment is worse, and the a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic is far less dangerous.   I would argue that marijuana should be illegal as long as all other a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics are illegal, but then again, marijuana has actually treated any group of human beings collectively with anorexia and helped other any group of human beings collectively with loss of appetite. What does alcohol do that helps when you ingest it? Nothing. It helps when you swab it on an open wound, but then again, why ingest such a thing? A thing so rancid it kills bacteria automatically?   The answer is that any group of human beings collectively just do. Prohibition proved that any group of human beings collectively always will, no matter what any government tries to do. Instead of jailing any group of human beings collectively, it should be legal, and taxed, and controlled by the government so that it doesn't somehow contribute to killing any group of human beings collectively.

84,"The reason I don't like marijuana, alcohol, hard a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics, and certain kinds of prescription medications is rather simple: I don't think the body of citizens of a state or country should sacrifice who they are, in some cases their free will or their humanity.   When someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotic or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control.  Marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth.   We, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. Drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. It is an escape; an escape which noone deserves.   I don't mind the body of citizens of a state or country escaping in other ways: video games, reading, television, camping..etc, at least they are still thinking, at least their self is still intact and operating.   When the body of citizens of a state or country do a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics they stop being the body of citizens of a state or country and start being Mr. or Ms. X+meth, or X+Marijuana, or X+alcohol. It isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run.   Governments and societies are meant to protect us; usually from dangers outside. This danger, this threat is unique in its internal, self-inflicted nature.   Again, Marijuana is only a petty offender in this case; which is why I am not adamant about its status as an illegal narcotic. There are far worse legal a substance that is used as a medicine or narcotics which I am much more concerned with.   Does that help in explaining my objection to its use? I am still forming my opinion on this one so I know my logic is abit choppy and in some cases exaggerated.",0
