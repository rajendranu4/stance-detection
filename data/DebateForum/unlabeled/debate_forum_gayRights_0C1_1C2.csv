0,"Men should fall in love with women   Says who?!   that's why they where created   They were not ""created."" They evolved into existence over billions of years.   And you are telling them what their purpose in life is. Your view is irrelevant to what they believe their purpose is.   women should get married to men because it makes ever ting easier.   How exactly does prohibiting someone from marrying who they love because some idiot says they shouldn't ""make ever ting easier?""  That is absolutely absurd.  I will not tolerate any attempt to forcibly take someone's rights because a f@#$in' 2000-year-old book says they should be killed. Who are your to dictate who one can and cannot love?",0,1
1,"I believe that the purpose in life is to grow and advance.   As do I. But it is not right for me to dictate my SUBJECTIVE beliefs onto others out of some perverted sense of duty. That is absurd.   However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers.   Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with  each other .",0,2
2,"Okay, I know SEVERAL children of same-sex parents and they turn out wacko.    Define ""whacko."" On a side note, I know SEVERAL children of opposite-sex parents and they turn out wacko.   I'm sorry, I can't support this scientifically   REALLY? Who the fuck would have ever guessed that?   but anyone else at my school will verify this.   You know you have a great argument when your basis is the opinion of a selective group of misguided school children. Obviously they know better than centuries of scientific observation, experimentation, and discovery.   A child who grows up seeing same-sex marriage will learn that it is okay.   I agree. And that is a GREAT thing. What exactly is wrong about homosexuality?   He will even think that it is his decision   No. Homosexuality is NOT a choice. We have scientific evidence to support this....that is unless those school children say otherwise.   Society won't benefit. America will become even more decadent.   WTF?",0,1
3,I agree. It is usually religious beliefs and guidance that stops others from doing a lot.,0,1
4,We are all first humans and then homosexuals or nots. They have rights as we do too. If they love each other than why not. Plus i think that homosexuals are pretty cool. All the ones i know are really nice :),0,1
5,I personally think marriage should be abolished all together. But I also believe anyone should be able to marry if they want to. What does it matter who it is?,0,1
6,"What are friends for? Not that kind of relationship. If I am attracted to a female then I can't help it. And I don't think friends are meant for that intimacy.  Same-sex isn't for marriage because people can't get over themselves. If people want to live together in love than no one else should be able to stop them. Regardless of color, sex, or any other factor that people can't control.",0,1
7,"But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy    Where do we have a right to be happy? I'm only happy if I'm not poor. Does that mean I have a right to money because it makes me happy?   are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments   Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date? If person x believes God says gay sex is wrong, why would that change over any number of years? Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom?  And is it bigoted to say being gay is bad? If you believe fornication (sex out of marriage) is wrong, you believe that in all cases. If you believe gay sex is wrong you believe that in all cases. Does that make someone a bigot? I'd be willing to believe you think murder is wrong in all cases, does that make you a bigot?  You are both arguing two separate points because you have two different life views. While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.",0,2
8,"I use the term ""arguing"" liberally here, this discussion fell apart a long time ago :)",0,2
9,"Everyone that is not hurting anyone else has the right to pursue their goals in life, and the things that make them happy.   Says who? There is no written protection anywhere in the constitution saying so. It can be inferred, perhaps, but it is not a guaranteed right. As such, the majority can vote on this issue any way they like until the constitution is changed in a legal fashion (i.e. the legislative branch).  Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony,   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist.   it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder? Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?",0,2
10,"Does marriage have a religious origin?  No. Marriage has always been a state institution, always requiring the recognition of the state regardless of what ritual religious or secular is attached to it.   I don't have an information to back me up here, but I find this statement highly dubious. For one thing, in much of recent history (up until the last century or so) church and state have been identical in many countries. Certainly now marriage must require the recognition of the state, but you would really have to show me some info to prove it's always been that way. Anytime you use the word ""always"" you had better have some damned good data to back you up.",0,2
11,"Where is discrimination not allowed? People are legally discriminated against all the time. Where is marriage a right? This is a very slippery slope. If the majority can be circumvented anytime someone says it's the ""right"" thing to do, we are not living in a democracy, we are living in a dictatorship.  We live in a constitutional govt where the constitution shows what the majority can and cannot do and what is legally ""right"". Show me in the constitution where marriage is a right (or more appropriately, where we have the right to marry whomever we want) and I will concede your argument.",0,2
12,"No one is telling anyone who they can love, we're talking about who they can marry, something very different. Unfortunately the burden of proof is not on the so-called ""bigots"" you mention (who just believe something different than you. If you believe everyone who believes different than you is a bigot, you might be surprised to discover that you have become one as well). Marriage is only currently legal between a man and a woman.  There is no constitutionally guaranteed right that gives anyone otherwise.  So in order to change it, you must pass a law democratically. If you can't do that you are free to try and persuade people why they should change their minds, but the burden of proof is on you.",0,2
13,"Marriage is a state-sponsored institution that gives some financial incentive for couples to be married because stable, 2 parent families raising children create a stable society. While it is obviously clear that many families do not fulfill this requirement, no homosexual couple can produce a child on their own. So maybe only 40% of hetro couples fulfill their obligation of being a good home and raising children there (I'm making this number up, but you get the idea), 0% of homosexual couples have children.  Maybe the financial incentives aren't worth it at all, in which case lets get the govt out of the marriage business (my own opinion), but there seems to be no incentive to invest in homosexual marriage. This is why I vote against it, but as I've always said, if a voting majority gives gays marriage, ok. It's really not an enormous deal.",0,2
14,"but a divorced, widowed, or adopted family is not as strong as a traditional home. This is just the way it is, however unfair. Children from these families are more likely to struggle.  Unfortunately, the govt job isn't to make sure everyone is treated fairly. This would be an impossible and expensive task (this is where we probably will disagree if you don't believe in very limited constitutional govt, which very few people believe in anymore). Besides, right now marriage IS equal: everyone can marry a member of the opposite sex. There is no inequality here. If we want to give people the right to marry members of the same sex, then let's do it, but this is, in fact, a change.  Before you call bigot, I am, in fact, not very religious and literally DON'T CARE if gays marry. It doesn't affect my life at all. I have two friends, a gay couple, who would make a perfect marriage. I just think people need to step away from their high emotions and look at this issue from the larger perspective. Also, everyone has a right to their own opinion and religion isn't bigotry. Even though I don't agree, if you don't want to vote for gay marriage because it's against your religion, congratulations, you have that right. In fact, this right actually IS a right, whereas marriage is nowhere in the constitution and not guaranteed to anyone. Don't like it? Change it! That is your right!",0,2
15,This is well put together and I concede this point. These are good reasons to vote to legalize it.,0,1
16,:) I think you mean exceptions. Acceptions would imply something completely different :),0,1
17,"Responses are much more effective when you do more than just ridicule the poster. I know a lot of people who decide to be gay, and I know even more people who think they are gay because they are musically inclined or sensitive and they are told their whole life that they are ""closet gays."" I find it incredibly prejudice to think that everyone who doesn't like beer and football or somehow misses the masculine bar is gay, and I think that IS one of the big problems with the publicity that homosexuality is making. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with me, but I think there is a baseline group of gay people and then a huge amount of other people who are gay because of peer pressure, insecurity, and/or because it's the popular thing to be right now.  I know, incoming down votes. Didn't say anyone had to agree, I just think it's stupid to tell someone else about their sexuality.  And please don't respond with ""studies prove,"" because as I've already said, they don't.",0,2
18,"I don't know anyone who decided to be gay? How do you know. I in point of fact know a very nice and happy gay man, who was once engaged and has told me to my face that he was a happy straight man, did some experimentation, found someone he really liked who was a man and made a choice to live a gay lifestyle. He said he was happy either way, but thinks this is what makes him happiest.  I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't. And after reading more of the responses on here it just gets back to this absurd point that those of us who are ""opposed"", and I use this term loosely because to tell you the truth, until the prop 8 fiasco in which the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me I honestly didn't give a damn, to gay marriage are hated, disposed, called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.  The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons. I honor democracy and I despise hatred and bigotry, and it saddens me that this seems to make me the enemy of the homosexual community, which wants tolerance only for their way of thinking.",0,2
19,"""That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out.""  Lol, see again, I am flabbergasted that it is impossible for you to accept that someone might have an opinion different from yours.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  One example of society telling someone they're gay? You! You just did! To Joe. If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.  ""Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?""  African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not. The fact that some nut-case has murdered a gay person before does not make everyone who believes homosexuality is wrong into a murderer. Are you in fear for your life often? If so I am sad, but I sort of doubt it, that's just not the way the world is anymore (in this country). Are you afraid to express your opinion about this topic? I doubt it. I am. If I tell people what I think, I LOSE MY JOB. That's why I post here anonymously :)  ""The Mormon and catholic churches, but especially the Mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right""  Marrying members of the same sex is not a human right. Sorry. Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this. As far as the donations go, the Mormon church DID NOT DONATE A DIME. Neither did the Catholic church (I think, I'm not positive about them). MEMBERS of these churches donated to a cause they believed was right. They have the right.  I have no problem with protests. I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them). I was opposed to it when the homosexuality was attacked and mocked and derided; I oppose it now when they do the same thing to their enemies.",0,2
20,"I never said they weren't discriminated against in history, that is certain and the way gays have been treated is sick. I said right now, the hatred is coming from the gay community. If you don't believe it, than just read these forums. Who is stupid? whoever disagrees with you. Who is the ""fanatical religious right?"" whoever disagrees with you. We must give you the right to do whatever you want no matter what the majority thinks. If we disagree we are driven from our jobs (the artistic director of Sacramento theater) we are attacked economically (there's a list now of everyone who donated to prop 8 and a demand to boycott their businesses) we are told that we had no right to vote that way. The Mormon church has had their buildings desecrated, their books burned, their members attacked and there is a demand to have their tax exempt status removed. Doctors are sued for refusing invitro fertilization. eharmony is sued for not providing gay matchmaking.  Yes, the gay community is attacking anyone who disagrees with them and it's sick.  If prop 8 had passed we would have gone with it, but we are ruthlessly attacked for disagreeing with you, and now the homosexual community is trying to destroy democracy and steal from me my right to vote because they don't think I have a right to decide where my tax money goes.  ya, somewhere in the US is an asshole who loudly attacks gays, but even my best friends who are gay are full of hate for everyone who disagrees with them, and that makes me very sad.",0,2
21,"There you go again. I disagree with you, so i'm a bigot. If someone thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a bigot, what does that make them? (I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)  The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.  Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances.   I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.  1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.  2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.  I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.  I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower).",0,2
22,"OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.  ""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""   http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/ bornorbred.pdf   a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  ""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  ""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""  I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)",0,2
23,"OK, so apparently I need to clarify every single statement and point out that when I said gays are not like serial killers AT ALL, and this was merely hyperbole to show a fallacious argument, I forgot to mention pedophilia. Homosexuality and pedophilia are obviously not related AT ALL. i thought this was pretty obvious from the way I wrote it, but apparently some people need it spelled out. I should have been more clear however.",0,2
24,"So I've been reading these points by all and I think we really need to step back and take a ""chill pill"" :) Opposing gay marriage doesn't mean we're ""homophobic"" or hate gays, so let's keep the ad homonym attacks to a minimum. I am opposed to gay marriage for a couple of very specific reasons, but I am in the theater business and of about 30 guys who are my close friends, 29 of them are probably gay, and I love them like crazy!  So again I want to say that, to use the debates words (although I think they are a little inflammatory), gay marriage does hurt everyone for the following reason: The prominent justification for gay marriage is that it is a right and that denying it will take away the rights of a minority, similar to the civil rights movement. Using this justification, any religious group that denies gays participation or clergy or marriage will be branded as persecuting homosexuals. The scary thing is that there are some people reading this right now and thinking ""yes, that would be discrimination and homophobia and should be stopped."" I just read a quote:  'Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor and gay activist who helps draft federal legislation related to sexual orientation, says that, when religious liberty conflicts with gay rights, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”'  http://article.nationalreview.com/ ?q=YTU5MjZmMDIyMDU3NjRiMjBlNjcxYTlmOGQ2 ODA5NjA=   (an altogether fetching article which says this entire thing much better than I have)  Gay marriage is an immediate threat to our freedoms AS IT IS CURRENTLY being pursued. The owners of eharmony.com are REQUIRED to provide gay matchmaking. They have no freedom to do otherwise. Doctors who provide in vitro fertilization are REQUIRED to do it for lesbian couples, even if this is against their beliefs. These doctors have lost their freedom.  Now gay marriage DOESN'T have to be this way. Pass legal laws which respect the beliefs of others. As I said, i love my gay friends, and I might be ok with some of them marrying (I say might because of all of these people, I can think of only one couple that even pretends to be serious about their relationship, and I think they are adorable! The others shouldn't marry imo, whether they are gay or straight or anything because they aren't serious, but that's just my opinion and it's honestly none of my business :). So as i said, go ahead and pass the laws, but don't take away the rights of others to believe that homosexuality is wrong, because THAT is what is against the constitution.",0,2
25,"Gay marriage by itself probably doesn't. Gay marriage as it is being lobbied for takes away the First amendment rights of many americans. States which have passed these laws immediately begin teaching children that it is ""ok"" and even ""good"" to be gay. Some people just don't believe this, and they have that right! You have a right to believe the sky is purple and you have a right to teach that to your children! You have a right to teach your children that black people are evil and gays are going to hell. Are you a stupid bigot? YES! but you do have that right!  I have no problem with gay marriage, I do have a problem with the invasion of people's rights to believe that gay union is wrong. I also do not believe that marriage is a constitutional right, so gay marriage would have to be approved by a majority of voters in order to be obtained (and not in a courtroom!). If all of this happens, great! Just don't take away the rights of those who are religious to believe gay union is wrong.",0,2
26,"Two rebuttals here i'd like to offer:  1) research about homosexual couples being better parents or that homosexuality is genetic. I'm sorry, but neither of these things are proven facts, and there is a lot of controversial research on both sides of the aisle. I think both sides should be able to agree here that neither side has been proven. I know, I know, you can show me 100 studies that say the above is true, but guess what, I can show you 100 studies that say the opposite and then we just get into the ""who's study is better"" thing, and it's just a waste of time. Many things can be conclusively proven. These are not yet in that category for either side. Besides, for all the ""studies show"" comments above, no one has cited a single one. I find the funniest thing about such studies is that everyone has heard of them and is sure something has been shown conclusively, but no one is quite sure when or where.  2) the adoption thing is really irrelevant I think. In this country there aren't hordes of orphans wishing for parents to adopt them. This is a myth taken from the situation some time ago. Walk into an adoption clinic, things have really changed. It's not easy to adopt. Now outside of this country things are very different I know, but I still don't think gay marriage is going to significantly impact this. Feel free to disagree with me here, I just really think this is a seperate topic. Oh, and if you disagree, I think you will see that studies show I'm right ;)  (I'm kidding in case you didn't catch that) :)",0,2
27,"Yes, unfortunately that is democracy. The constitution gives us certain basic rights. If we want more we can pass laws to make more by majority vote or through our elected representatives. If those rights violate the constitutional ones, the courts can overturn them. If this happens the people can amend the constitution to pass the law anyway.  The constitution didn't give anyone the right to marry. People have passed laws allowing marriage between a man and a woman. These laws apply equally to all, so equal protection isn't violated (I'm sorry, you have just as much a right to marry a member of the opposite sex as anyone else). If you don't like it, you vote to change the laws.  That's democracy. It's not perfect, but it's the best thing out there!  Oh, and it's not the same as civil rights, and if I was black I would be horribly offended by such a comparison. They were fighting for basic human rights which had been denied them. They were being killed, and denied work opportunities and the right to vote. Homosexual's aren't being denied anything (that isn't already denied to everyone else in the country). They just aren't getting what they want.",0,2

For example, as a young child we touch the red coils of a electric stove; we associate that experience with the emotional response and though our reasoning when we see something glowing we think that its likely hot by inductive generalization. With out emotion we would have nothing stopping us from touching the next red glowing thing we see and our hands would be very burnt. Emotionally, we don't like pain.   One of my oldest friends is gay; if he one day wants the legal rights granted by marriage; he should be able to have them even if the other consenting adult in the contract is male. Personally I wouldn't mind marriage being abolished, perhaps replaced with a contract that legally incorporates someone into your family, without the religious and sexual undertones of marriage.

Avoid that something.  with out emotion, we would only have: something causes injury, a statement, and no reasoning would be possible concerning if we should avoid it.

That person would still be providing a good home, because the material, emotional and developmental needs of their children would be meet. If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, ""it takes a village to raise a child"".  Some homosexual couples adopt. gay marriage would allow for people to pool resources together better because of the financial incentives, meaning more stable families being more capable of adopting which would lessen the burden on foster care.

There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts.

You're right, never give in to conformity and we're trying not to! You talk about the few being louder. They have to be just to get the ear of those who can put things right. Ever hear of the Boston Tea Party? Those people were in the minority but they were absolutely right. What came from that was the fundamental right to be represented while being taxed.  What is a family? In today's world it is many things. A mother and father with children, a mother and child, a father and child, a child who has been abandoned but has been rescued through adoption or foster care and the gay couple or person whose God given right to have children has been thwarted by people like you. It's not ""We"" who have been created to be with the opposite sex. It is ""You"" and many, many others like you but what if you weren't created that way? What if you were created to be exactly what you are? Straight, Gay, Asexual and whatever else there is?  Homosexuality is not abnormal simply because you say so. You put up a debate in the last couple of weeks about wanting to read a good book. Good! Go read one about Homosexuality and how right it really is. What once was considered a malady of the mind is now a malady of the homophobe because you dare not disturb your thinking. So what that most people aren't gay? That has about as much to do with anything as most people not being born on Pitcairn Island! No one is being brainwashed here but you...especially not ""laterally.""  It goes against your beliefs and you have a right to those to those beliefs. Yes you do...but I'll tell you what Jake. In the time you've been here I have never once seen you alter anything about YOUR beliefs. Your beliefs are as old as Methuselah and you do not wish to alter them one degree by reading, interacting with or trying to understand what Gay people are or represent. We are all things, just like straight people are.   You even have the gall to bring in the Constitution of the United States.

112,The eventual alien invasion??? By the looks of things we've already been invaded!  What you're saying is that any two people who marry must have children or it renders their commitment to one another moot! That is one of the saddest statements I've ever heard. What would you do Tug if you married and your wife couldn't have children for some reason. Would you divorce her and move on to someone fertile? What would you expect your wife to do if it were you whose sperm was not healthy enough to fertilize an egg?  The fact is that Gays can have children in ways including adoption and artificial insemination and there is nothing but personal opinion to prevent that from taking place. Straight people fear Gay folks mostly because they understand little about them. They're just like you Tug...just like you and everyone else in the world.,0,1

I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing.  I tell you what I've experienced personally and do not resort to the ""fact"" sheets.

You now have both of the words and/or statements by which the union is known. Does this mean we can have neither? If, as you state, we are not entitled to it then what shall people who wish to be married and enjoy a Civil Union be called? And why should it have to change?

It's not the word they object to...it's the entire concept. Your analogy of the homeless guy needing a bed to sleep in is about as demented as you are.   Joe, I don't give a twaddle if you agree with me on any issue but the one thing you're wrong about is that I ever expected you to share my views nor do I expect that from anyone here or in my life. That's not friendship, that's being a puppet at someone else's whim. Being a friend Joe means that one must choose words carefully when you know that the other person is offended or hurt by the subject matter. You don't make a joke about it, at the very least!

I said what I did because it was wrong and you were my ally even though I was still bruised from the last brouhaha regarding Repubgal.

I don't need your permission to do that and I don't care if you like it or not.   And if you're going to quote the Serenity Prayer, why don't you try and get it right. Perhaps the real prayer will mean more than Joe's version of it. It goes like this Boffo:  God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference.

And I'll bring it up again and again until I can get the attention of the powers that be. My vision of how votes should be used also doesn't differ that much from what was perceived as the correct way to use them, whether they be up or down. I don't have to have a complete reason for why someone up or down voted me or anyone else but down voting has been as huge issue for me since I'm the one who got hit. I certainly didn't notice anyone stepping up to say that was wrong before I made the accusatory debate. People can simply run in and out of debates, down vote someone they don't like and up vote those they do and that is not right! It renders the numbers meaningless. I also haven't heard any suggestions made to make the voting better for everyone!  Accepted? Yes! Everyone wishes to be accepted on their own terms but if that means I must accept a person when they behave like a complete ass, that's not something I would do. If someone else has a problem with me they usually state it but I haven't heard much from anyone except the very young ones so what shall I think? There are plenty of people whose views I don't agree with but I accept them for who they are and how they are, generally speaking. The only thing I do not accept, across the board, are those that are ill mannered and can say nothing in defense of their own arguments other than to start the name calling or rag on the age routine. I don't wish to have my cake and eat it too and I do not understand why you would accuse me of wanting that.

It a bit presumptuous of anyone to utter those words on subject matter they know so little about. Let me turn the tables though, for just one moment, when I say to you...HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BEING GAY IS NOT A CHOICE!  I have known ""families"" with two moms and two dads. They were very loving families and the children felt that love very deeply...even when the questions came, as they always do. Most of the kids I kept track of wouldn't have traded their upbringing for one second because it taught them things about prejudice, acceptance, being different and being OK with that. They say they would not have had that same opportunity has they been raised by straight parents. All of them are fine and none of them are gay, no matter which gender they grew up with.",0,1
145,"That's one of your problems Jake...You tell people...you don't reason it out or even back it up with facts, statistics or anything else of value. You are completely homophobic Jake, face it. The possibility of this being a viable relationship is so foreign to you that you believe a child would be ruined by being a part of that relationship. Homosexuality is not a disease my friend...it's a way of life that was given those of us who are. No one should be punished because of it.",0,1
146,"I'm not at all certain that is correct Jake. The estimate on the number of gays vs. straights in this country is about 10%. It may well be more, but the family structure has been maintained thus far in the world and will probably remain so. Yes, I would agree that any child needs a Mom or Dad to look up to and it is easier when there are one of each, however, I believe studies have shown very few, if any, bad affects have been realized from a two mom or two dad household.

It's also interesting to me that the churches have softened their views of this too. Not the Catholic church but others. Some even ordain gay people into the priesthood or the ministry.

226,"There are lots of binding traditions you could call ""marriage"" and Christians were far from the first to invent these. It seems silly they would be allowed to ban others from it because it's their word (not their concept).   Also marriage is a lot more than a religious tradition nowadays; you can have many different churches preform a marriage, not all of them Christian, as you can the government through a courthouse. One acceptable option would to be to completely sever the link between church and state in this regard and stop giving financial benefits to married couples; then gays would only be denied something of religious significance.   Another viable option is for Christianity to change it's views, as it has done numerous times in the past, to allow gay marriage. Yet another alternative is for Christianity to allow the gays to form a splinter religion, as has been done numerous times in the past, and this similar and affiliated religion would be able to sanction gay marriage.   In conclusion: Christians didn't invent marriage, it's not their business to police it. If they want to police it, the state shouldn't compensate and reward them for their efforts. If they still want tax breaks and financial aid, they need to drag themselves out of the stone age yet again, or otherwise allow gay churches to preform their own gay marriages, if they really want nothing to do with it.",0,1
227,"Oftentimes it's one specific issue that causes some religious people to want to splinter off and make their own similar but different (on that one issue) religion. One needs only look at the many, many branches of Christianity to see that people have a lot of different opinions on proper Christian faith and behavior. I don't see why homosexuals shouldn't be able to do the same, and have rights that other splinter churches enjoy (there are LGBT Christian churches nearby that I know of, but they cant preform a legally binding gay marriage). We allow religious people to pick-and-choose the aspects of their faith that they want to follow and don't usually revoke privileges or rights for it. You can have just about every sin in the book on your hands and still be Christian, still have a Christian marriage, but these things don't always hold true if your sin is homosexuality. I get that homosexuality, like everything else, is an abominable sin in the Christian faith, but they don't allow or deny marriage rights based on how much you sin or what your sins are. If you're a gay Christian and you want to marry another gay Christian, why can't you have a Christian marriage?   I guess I've always seen the beliefs of the church and Christians as very mailable and ever-shifting; they alter their views so they can be accepted and supported by their host community. If the Church still opposed interracial marriage, for example, priests and Christians would be mocked and ridiculed for it. Yet at one time it was a valid and accepted position for them to hold. Allowing gay marriage is just the next grudgingly progressive step this backward religion is going to take; they're going to kick, scream, and really dig their heels in, no doubt, but Christianity has been fighting a losing battle since it was created, always giving ground to civil liberties at the last possible second, before they draw too much hatred upon themselves for their bigotry.",0,1

You haven't shown abnormal behavior to be unacceptable, just stated that it is frequently unaccepted - by people like you.  I suppose the once deviant notion that a woman's word was equal to that of a man's, the abnormal view that women should be allowed to vote and own property was just ""a slide of hands"" by the women's rights movement. And, of course, if we apply your logic evenly, this makes them immoral and unethical for perpetrating deviant behavior. Godforbid we see it as social progress, it was something new and different, how could it be?   Your slippery slope argument comes off more like paranoia.

My concern is that gay marriage is being voted against, which means that more people don't like seeing it than those that can be bothered to vote for something which will probably never affect them. And while we may disagree with the result, it's hard to argue with democracy.   Wow, I didn't think people could ever be so stupid.

You are right in saying that marriage is between a man and a woman, but only because the word structure necessitates it.

You ask why the state should give them costly benefits, yet you ignore that the state is giving  hetero sexual couples the same costly benefits that we are arguing over with  homo sexual couples. If you wish to point out why the state should give them costly benefits, you surely need to be fair and ask that about ALL groups that ARE given those costly benefits versus the ones you do not think that should.

They bring no harm and it's not our place to legislate in the affairs of consenting adults wishing to love when no other harmful factors have been proven.

Its like someones Dad being a racist and 20 years down the line they find themselves spurting a racist comment and catch themselves not even believing their own words.

376,"What does it mean to have gay marriages legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.",0,2
377,"Both. It's very hard to obtain legal rights without acceptance by society.   Well, you know my stance. Marriage is about both  a   and   b . Legal rights must be equal for gay couples if their unions are no different to straight couples unions.   The ""upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries"" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the legal sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate   What dictionary? You're so paranoid you think everyone around you is homophobic or something? I promise you I didn't look at a dictionary when I wrote this. Scout's honor! The legal sense of marriage comes from the common sense of marriage. You don't just make laws out of thin air, you base it on society's common rituals and traditions and ways of carrying out business and conducts.  Homosexuality is totally ok.",0,2
378,"I agree with you that words evolve with time as societies evolve.   So I guess the reason why the idea of marriage hasn't included gay unions is because societies haven't yet evolved to accept it.   Like I said before, I personally think of marriage as 2 people coming together with the intention of loving and being with each other for ever and to have children with each other etc.... Now, if some time in the future this picture comes up in my mind when I attend a gay wedding, then I don't even need a dictionary to tell me that a marriage is not just for straight people, the same way I didn't need a dictionary to tell me what a marriage is now.   Geriatrics marry young perky girls all the times, but don't ask me to accept that as a marriage. People do what they want and they're free to do  it  and I will not stop them, just don't ask me to accept that their idea of  it  is the same as my idea of  it . The word  ""it""  can apply to many things, for example my idea of fun is going to a nightclub, others think it's fun to put a cat into a bag and hit the bag with a baseball bat...",0,2
379,"Yes, it's no big deal as in the world won't end or society won't collapse like you said, but that's the same as a waiter bringing me an orange juice (OJ) when I asked him for a lemonade and explain to me that it's the same and it's no big deal. I mean it's a drink and it'll quench my thirst, hell it even has a similar citrusy quality, but it's not lemondade so it shouldn't be called lemondade.  .  A marriage is a bit more important than a drink and when it comes to marriage, I do actually want my children to grow up with the same idea of marriage as mine. This is because my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren, etc.. I suspect that lots of other people feel the same way, and even though things do not always turn out as perfectly as we would like, the goal should not shift. Changing the definition of the word marriage is the first step away from that goal. Sure the children will find their own ways and decide what marriage is by themselves and everything like that, and I may not have much input into the process, but  if they should ever need guidence in their lives  (and I'm sure that we all do sometime in our lives) they can come to me, and I'd guide them accordingly and I'd have a legal backup. In terms of the word marriage, I re-assert my view that its definition should even be more narrow than it is currently. Old men and young women should not be included.  .  Now, people can drink OJ and call it lemonade if they want (in Vietnam they call a cheese sandwich: ""hotdog""), I fully respect that, but I don't think that the definition of lemondade should change. I respect people's choices :) and they can do what they like amongst themselves.",0,2
380,"The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life   The ""drinks"" analogy was used to explain why we shouldn't go around changing the definition of words. This does not mean you can't get an OJ whenever you want. You're free to get OJs. No restrictions on getting OJs. Drink OJs until you get OJ poisoning if you like :) But don't get an OJ and call it a lemonade and then expect others to accept that. Of course you're free to call an OJ a lemonade amongst yourselves. That's how you should relate the ""drinks"" analogy to gay marriage.  .  Gay marriage doesn't harm me in any way and I've never even come close to saying that anywhere, so please don't think that.  .   Allowing gays to marry doesn't impede straight marriage in any way   It wouldn't impede directly, however like I explained, it will alter the idea of marriage. We were talking about the idea of marriage and I simply don't want my children to be confused about that idea and what it means. That's why with the rate things are going now (all kinds of unions are included in the idea of marriage), I'd even like to restrict the definition, not expand it.",0,2
381,"there are several good reasons for expanding the definition of marriage to include gay marriage -- reasons like fairness, liberty, and equality   Gay people are currently free to do anything they want, so in terms of fairness, liberty and equality, gay people are not disadvantaged at all.   .   You can just tell your kids, ""Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children.""   I'd rather not have to stray from the legal definition. Kids are always accusing parents of saying something and then do something else. This will add to that problem.  .  I'm not advocating that we stop gay unions. How can we? It's love right? You can't stop love! Perhaps we should move on to discuss the specific rights of a married couple  vs  those of united gay couples, see where there might be discrepancies and why they exist, and adjust it if there's no good reasons for them.",0,2

436,"Gay people should get their own thing? I agree. In support, can anyone provide a very good reason as to why black people should have gotten their own kind of marriage? That is also what you liberals would call an ""arbitrary"" or ""capricious"" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should ""get their own thing"". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and ""new"" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G ""Great"" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts.

That would make them outcasts. Kids are extremely brutal just read A Child's Machiavelli, everything rings true. Picture your average bully not only picking on a kid because of his looks but now he has a weapon that would make that kid a total outsider to all other kids. Kids find it odd when a kid has no father or mother, or when he/she lives with his/her grandparents or are adopted to a hetero family a kid with 2 fathers or mothers doesn't fit into the mix for a proper upbringing in a peers perspective at a young age. It would all lead down a messed up life for the kid down the road he would be confused with his sexual orientation and countless other issues.  But then ,maybe all the toughness would make that kid an even better person than all the other kids that made fun of him or didn't step forward to defend him.

""The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions.""  if you want to live in a society that only lets us get to do stuff that benefits them, then why don't we go all the way, live, and sleep where they want, eat what, and when they want, to condition us to do what they want, since everything is about thier benefit.

""A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature.

""As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature.""  you can argue that we have the capabilities of sex in order to reproduce. however I don't see how homosexuality is hurting nature, and even though they can't do what through sex what sex is naturally there for, they're desires and needs are still natural and therefore is natural for them to pursue it.  ""Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)""  yes to an extent, that is the first thing we think of when we think of marriage because marriage is about love and since heterosexuality is the norm, then when we think about love we automatically associate it with men and women. marriage is in culture more seen as a loving commitment, therefore if two people love each other, then isn't them marrying just part of the culture?  ""Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just.""  how can you believe that two people loving each other is not a right but something we just let them do? we are not allowed to love whoever we want?

I do agree. that right or wrong in society is vague therefore we need to have it legalized in order for it to be allowed but that is only because we can't simply say that ""whatever doesn't harm anyone else is allowed and does harm others is not allowed."" because what harms or doesn't harm is subjective, therefore we created the political system we have in order to try and sort out all of the issues and together decide what is harmful and what isn't. illegalizing the right to love someone is discriminatory due to the fact that they aren't harming anyone, our government is not perfect and if people say that homosexuality is a problem then it will be treated like one, but it is not.",0,1
490,See my other arguments disputing the founders of the debates args.,0,2
491,"Heterosexual marriage laws the ground work for a relationship that creates and raises children. (sperm + egg). Now, the goverment gives many benefits economically, tax wise, etc to married couples. [2] The reason they only give them to traditional couples is because of their ability to procreate. Having children is the only way to continue society and advance our culture and race. As the heterosexual couples are the only people who can advance society in this way, and well pay back the benefits they get through marriage, then they deserve a state recognition. The goverment makes laws based of of interests, and their interest in this case is procreation. Therefore allowing gay marriage would be unjust as it debars the special recognition the heterosexual couples deserve.  People who are pro gay marriage usually have the claims that marriage is about love, but this is far from true. If marriage is about love, then why is the state involved? They are involved due to some sort of interest. If the goverment cared about love, then they would attempt to regulate and control friendships or non marital relationships.  The reason they regulate marriage over these other relationships is because marriage is where you are meant to produce a larger workforce. The reason they do not regulate other relationships is because they have no good reason to do so, at all.  The goverment in marriage needs two things: 1) legal commitment, 2) procreation and the ability to raise a child. A boyfriend girlfriend relationship may produce offspring in the process, but as they are not legally binding situation it is easier for them to break apart, and they will not be able to raise the child. A homosexual relationship will be lacking the legal bind, and the ability to produce offspring. Even if we did give them a legal bind, they would not be able to create children therefore not fulfilling the states interest fully.  One argument used against the procreation argument is the infertile argument. This objection is a misunderstood rebuttal, they do not understand the debate at point. The argument is not fully based of of the ability to reproduce, but rather a type of relationship in which procreation is possible to start off. It is not an argument fully based of of the argument they can make kids, but also an argument based of of the ability to have the similar effect, a procreative type union.  My opponent without a doubt will start to argue as marriage has benefits isn't it fair homosexuals receive them too? Any society, goverment, or institution that distinguishes marriage in a certain way will prohibit some types of marriage. A prohibition of SSM does not violate the equal protection clause as we must first have a definition of what marriage is. You cannot confirm that a SSM ban is unconstitutional unless we determine exactly what marriage is, and what it is for. [3]  It is only unconstitutional if they are unjustly debarred the right. Ex: Is it unconstitutional if we debar a murderer from a gun? No. That is a just cause, and with my secular case against gay marriage I have proven they are justly debarred the right. By saying it is unconstitutional you are saying it discriminates without just cause, and that this group deserves the right. As murderers do not deserve a right to a gun, then it is constitutional. In the states eyes homosexual couples cannot produce offspring therefore do not fulfill states interest, and do not deserve the right.  Just because something may have inherent good effects does not mean they deserve the legal benefits. The challenge to my opponent, and the argument he needs to press is: What are the states interest in giving these couples rights? If the State has no reason to give you benefits then why should they? Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.  Last statement:  1."" Heterosexual union is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).  2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.  3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.  4. Civil ordinances which recognize gay marriage as comparable to heterosexual marriage constitute a rejection of the special value of heterosexual unions.  5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.  6. Therefore, gay marriage is unjust.""[1]   http://wisdomandfollyblog. com/2008/10/02/ an-argument-against-gay-marriage/     http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/ marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html    Sherif Girgis, Robert P.

495,"This is an interesting topic because most people argue based on their emotions rather than rational thought. Before individuals start accusing me of being homophobic, homosexuality should be accepted as part of life however the raising of children in a same sex household has many questions unanswered.  Dr Albert Dean Byrd a well educated child and family pyschologist has researched this topic for sometime and he found that children throughout their developmental stages need a MOTHER and a FATHER.   He states  ""Children raised in homes with both mothers and fathers navigate the  developmental stages more easily, are more solid and secure in their sense of  self and in their sense of gender identity, perform better in the school system,  have fewer social and emotional problems and become better functioning  adults.""  He further points out the roles the Mother and Father play in the up bringing of a child.   ""Mothers use touch to calm, soothe and to bring comfort to children. When mothers  reach for children, they frequently bring them to their breasts to provide safety,  warmth and security. Father’s touch is most often described as playful and  stimulating, bringing with it a sense of excitement to the child.""

According to studies, ""Wendell Ricketts and Roberta Achtenberg, in the article ""Adoption and Foster Parenting for Lesbians and Gay Men: Creating New Traditions in Family"" from Homosexuality and Family Relations, address social workers grappling with the issue by asking, ""...should children be sheltered from every experience in which their difference might challenge prejudice, ignorance, or the status quo (or in which they would be 'exposed' to the difference of others)? Agencies conforming to such a standard must ask themselves whether it is their function to honor the system that generates stigma by upholding its constraints."" They continue, ""Teasing is what children do. Does this mean that child welfare policy must be set at a level no higher than the social interactions of children?""  ""The bulk of evidence to date indicates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to become homosexual than children raised by heterosexuals. As one researcher put it, ""If heterosexual parenting is insufficient to ensure that children will also be heterosexual, then there is no reason to conclude that children of homosexuals also will be gay"". 11  ""Studies asking the children of gay fathers to express their sexual orientation showed the majority of children to be heterosexual, with the proportion of gay offspring similar to that of a random sample of the population. An assessment of more than 300 children born to gay or lesbian parents in 12 different samples shows no evidence of ""significant disturbances of any kind in the development of sexual identity among these individuals"". 12   ""Courts have expressed concern that children raised by gay and lesbian parents may have difficulties with their personal and psychological development, self-esteem, and social and peer relationships. Because of this concern, researchers have focused on children's development in gay and lesbian families.  The studies conclude that children of gay or lesbian parents are no different than their counterparts raised by heterosexual parents. In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""  Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation. A parent's capacity to be respectful and supportive of the child's autonomy and to maintain her own intimate attachments, far outweighs the influence of the parent's sexual orientation alone.""",0,1

I would argue that someone who does not love themselves, should not attempt to love anyone else. You have to love yourself, and you have to have a genuine love for someone else in order to successfully raise a child. The child understand that love.

I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember?

No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads.

It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.  By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me.

Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad.   Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed.   One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School).

Animals display it on a daily routine. Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in ancient history, had many homosexual tendencies. (even on a more intense level of pedophilia)   As an evolving society, homosexuality was bound to get to the point it has today. Let me also add that if you knew anything about the adoption procedure and the psychological harm that those who go through adoption have to deal with, it would pale to comparison to the teasing they would go through in their schooling.  My point is that on items of sexuality it is not all monkey see monkey do.   I have so many points and so little time. I'm very happy to see the down votes. (means I'm getting to you people!)

520,"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree with you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed.   Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing.   Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation.   Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption.",0,1

I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.

Two women cant do any better raising a boy to be a man than a single mother can, and we all know what that has done to entire generations of young men.

534,"All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females.   In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.  Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.",0,2
535,"Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.",0,2
536,"No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.    Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds.   Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.    And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny.",0,2
537,"Yes, you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree.   Next, you stated in the second paragraph,” Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in.”  My response:  The premise posits that the term parenthood has, ’many definitions’. It also, propositionally, establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term. (This is a non- discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion.) The introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term/s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion. And moreover, the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument. However, disregarding what your intent may or may not be, I will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree.  You stated:  When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   My response:  If what you claim is true then let’s test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle. The principle: When a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs, they no longer have rights to that which is theirs. (Lucidly stated for the debate)  A. A husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house.  B. A husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free; they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car.  C. A husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets.  All three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership. Albeit, a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person. For the thief presumes it is now his/her property for the taking.  All parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children, vehicles, houses, or pets. Let’s move on to the next statement.   You claimed:   Since this, (to raise or nurture), is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent.   My response:  Children of the age 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature; therefore they are possible targets to be parents. Individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria. Should they too be allowed to adopt? Pedophiles exactly meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt? The most hardened criminals meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt?  The ultimate conclusion, logically deduced from my arguments, is that no man, woman, or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with, including myself. No one in the world has a right to adopt. No institution in the world has a right to adopt. For if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person.  A homosexual has no right to adopt. However, the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling. No right is necessary. And the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority.  Therefore, no gay has a right to adopt. Which is the actual question of the debate.",0,2
538,"In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when it’s two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.    You claim that my argument, ‘fail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation.   You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.  Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question.   Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.  Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt.   Argument is both invalid and fallacious.  Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious)   Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)  There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.  They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.    I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium.

539,"Hello,  Pardon the delay.  Is sex a crime? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual.   All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire.   The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.  All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful.   The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:  1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)  2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)  3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)  I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together.",0,2
540,"I am very surprised that you would opt to oppose an argument of mine so soon after our last debate. Perhaps you enjoyed the debate? Let’s see where round number two shall lead the discourse.   You asserted: The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective.

Your proposition is identical in principle to the following proposition:   The problem with your car is that you are looking at the gas cap from the wrong side.   Both propositions are simply irrational.  Moreover, instead of identifying the problem of my argument, your argument proceeds to make claims that have not been syllogistically demonstrated. The argument presumes that the audience grants the propositions without argument; unless of course your argument is purely hypothetical.

Must be  E. More likely  F. No definitive proof  G. The possibility is a strong one  Do you simply want to engage in a debate? If so, name the subject-matter.

541,"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :  In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution   I suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.  The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.  My response:  Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.  If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.  We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual?   The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:  The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.   Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.    If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.    I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.)   Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.  One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.",0,2
542,"You sated:  ""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.   If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""  My response:  Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another.   You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.  Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.  Again, you stated:   'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'  Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:  Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.  Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.  Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.  Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.  Reductio ad absurdum!  Again, you stated:  'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. '  What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.  Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities.   You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”  Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.  And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best.   The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers.",0,2
543,"Your first argument compares two things that are not related; this is a fallacy of faulty analogy. The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child.

Therefore, we can deduce from your claim that homosexuals are biologically deprived of the necessary organs for the conception of a child. Lastly, the argument is ineffective in proving any thing syllogistically. And as for the remainder of your claims and rhetorical questions they don’t deserve refutation. The entirety of the argument fails to prove one thing that has been validly deduced by the author.    Your final statement,” The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay.”   A. It is a sentence fragment. The subject is identified but there is no predicate.   B.

But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).  To quickly state my piece:  Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt.

I found an old article about this issue a while ago:    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/ 26florida.html    It was about the Florida ban on gay adoption that was ruled unconstitutional (but you can see that from the title).

I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever.

If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be).

Although you are right in saying each parent gives certain lessons to a child and it's important that that child has different influences, these lessons do not have to come from people of the same gender. Different parents are going to be different no matter their gender. Nurturing doesn't necessarily come from the mother and discipline from the father. Also, say the parents are both men, the children aren't going to be secluded from women in their life. They will have aunts, grandmothers, teachers, family friends, etc that can serve as role models and examples. Also, regardless of whether your arguments make sense or not, it simply isn't shown in any studies done on children raised by gay parents",0,1

I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids.

Perhaps, if the child is female, and her parents are both male, she will turn out to be more masculine than the average girl, but what is wrong with that? I also believe that if her two parents are both very feminine, she will turn out to be 'normal.' So, it is not so much the gender of the parents, but their personalities that mold the child. In this country, many hetero parents with children get divorces, or one of the parents dies, and it is then legal for only the mother/father to raise the child on their own. So, if having either no mother/father figure screws up a child, shouldn't raising a child on your own be illegal for as long as gay adoption is?  Also, don't most, or at least some, adopted babies come from third world countries where they will end up living their lives in poverty, violence, and probably no parents if they are not adopted?

614,"I actually know of a few, who maybe don't ""resent"" being adopted, but wished they had their actual parents, and blame a lot of their psychological problems on the fact that they weren't raised by their parents.    Only in THIS time, does this scenario hold so much value. When someone is born by an accident, and then is not wanted, and is raised poorly because of the fact. Why are adoption programs established in the first place? Because there are more people having sex that don't want children, there are more people without the means to have children, but want children, and there are more people out there suffering from bad parenting. This hasn't always been the case, see what I've said to Kukla.    The chances of ""accidentally"" having children, and the chances of not being able to care for the child, have to be higher now than any other time in history, partly due to the fact that there are just more people in general out there at this moment than any other specific time in history. If the failure rate is higher now than ever, and the number of gays raising children are higher than ever too, logically, the percent of failure has to effect the lower number, the gay adopters, more than the people having the children by accident. Also, something to conceder is, why are they failing? If it's because of the income, look at the percent of failure with a mother and father in the same income bracket than the adopter's, you will find that there is a wide gap.   Most accidental births, I'm sure, are well taken care of despite the fact that they weren't planned, more often in a higher income bracket than a lower. The people with a low income will fail, whereas the people in the higher one, even though it's accidental, will be taken care of just as well as ones raised by adopters, because they are given money, and already have the money to do so.   In all of time, there have been more straight couples with money and children than gay couples with money and children... think about it.

616,"Gay Parenting Does Affect Children Differently, Study Finds  -- Authors Believe Gay Parents Have ""Some Advantages""  Taking issue with 20 years of research conclusions that say there are no differences, two University of California sociologists recently re-examined data from 21 studies on gay parenting dating back to 1980.   The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same.   Leaders of national gay-affirming groups said they welcomed the article, according to an Associated Press story. ""I'm thrilled that they're tackling these issues,"" said Aimee Gelnaw, executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, who is a lesbian parent raising two children with her partner. ""Of course our kids are going to be different,"" Gelnaw said. ""They're growing up in a different social context.""   Openness to Gay Relationships  Met With ""Elation""  Kate Kendall, head of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, also is raising two children with her partner. ""There's only one response to a study that children raised by lesbian and gay parents may be somewhat more likely to reject notions of rigid sexual orientation -- that response has to be elation,"" Kendall said.   But Amy Desai, a policy analyst with the group Focus on the Family, said the new report is alarming in its suggestions that children of gay parents might be more open to homosexual activity. ""Kids do best when they have a married mother and a married father,"" she said.   A Home With No Dad is Better?  The study's co-author, Judith Stacey, is a professor of contemporary gender studies. In addition to pointing out the gender differences in the two groups of children, she states that there are in fact some advantages to an all-female parental team without Dad living in the home: a female couple tends to be more involved in the children's lives and is in greater harmony in terms of parenting approaches.   Among the findings cited by the authors:   1. Compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They show greater interest in activities with both masculine and feminine qualities. They have higher aspirations to occupations that are not traditionally female.   2. In terms of aggression and play, sons of lesbians behave in less traditionally masculine ways. They are likely to be more nurturing and affectionate than their counterparts in heterosexual families.   3. One study examined by the researchers indicated that a significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbians had engaged in a same-sex relationship (six of 25 interviewed) than those raised by a heterosexual mother (none of 20 interviewed).   4. Those raised by lesbian mothers were also more likely to consider a homosexual relationship.   5. Teen-age and young adult girls raised by lesbian mothers appear to be more sexually adventurous and less chaste than girls raised by heterosexual mothers. Sons, on the other hand, were somewhat less sexually adventurous and more chaste than boys raised by heterosexuals.   6. The studies indicate that sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on the mental health of children.   ""These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,"" said the authors.   NARTH""s Joseph Nicolosi offered the following comments: ""This paper was authored by a professor of gender studies, so it is not surprisingly that the differences on which she focused have to do with a rejection of gender conformity. Indeed, what she found makes sense -- lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons, and a masculinizing effect on their daughters.   ""But the question is, are these differences healthy? More research is needed to understand how a rejection of conventional gender roles can have not just a healthy and expansive, but also a constricting and negative effect on identity and psychological health.   ""And despite what many gender researchers claim, research tells us that the absence of a father in the home is not, on balance, good for families.""

We are born man or woman (minus a few genetic mutations), not both. There are two genders solely for the reason of reproduction, which is what intercourse was intended for. Not for enjoyment.  4.

While it's quite easy to capitalize words like FREEDOM and think we are making a stunning point, we must remember that it is impossible for everyone everywhere to have the freedoms he or she would want. Rights and freedoms and privileges will always contradict. Thus, we all have to look around and agree as a society that we will value other human beings and chose not to deprive them of certain rights, especially in favor of our deleterious 'freedoms.'   Remember that not of the 'rights' that we have in American (speech, etc.) are really natural, but the product of a country that was based on the ideals that all men were created equal, working towards the goal of a 'more perfect union' by canonizing laws that are in line with that humanitarian ideal.",0,1

Do you keep that prominent and show it off to everyone as a testament to your commitment to another human being, whom you love greatly?

671,"So let me get this straight. As long as a majority of people oppose someone else's right to something they themselves enjoy, that wronged person has to wait until the majority get with the program, and then and only then, does he get to enjoy what everyone else is enjoying? Huh?   The religious right can and do believe anything they want, no matter how stupid and obnoxious and irrational it is. They can and do teach their kids whatever nonsense they care to.  My right to equal protection under the law - my right to enjoy the same tax breaks, visitation rights, and property inheritance rights everyone else has - does not in any way interfere with that. How do you conceivably justify this denial of my rights under the same constitution and under the same tax code, with whatever minor challenge to someone's religious beliefs there could possibly be?  This is like denying rights to African Americans or Hispanics because the KKK has issues with it. That wouldn't stand for a second. Why am I any different?  No one is challenging any one's right to their beliefs here. But as a taxpaying American, I most certainly DO demand the same rights as you enjoy.  Let's be perfectly straight here: no one is asking a church to perform a same sex wedding. Most people who are gay wouldn't step foot in a church to begin with because there is so much hate there. As Ghandi said, ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. They are so much unlike him.""  There are plenty of Christian churches that love and accept us that no one would ever bother for one moment thinking about going into one of the palaces of hate that so many churches have become. So how in heaven's name does that interfere with your religion?  My own Episcopalian church couldn't possibly be a more warm and inviting place for gay and lesbian people. I love it there. It has allowed me to grow and thrive as a Christian. The old Baptist church I was raised in was a spiritual killing field. What kind of idiot would go back there for any reason?",0,1

673,"""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."" —Genesis 1:27  Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. ""Have ye not read,"" He said, ‘that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.  So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanity—like the domino effect.  I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.  People—primarily the homosexual community—say, ""Who are others to say who we should be able to love?"" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. Aha—therein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual ""marriages."" You see the truth is, it's not about ""love""—it is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, ""So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..."" But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying ""Well that's what homosexuals want to do!""   First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, ""... to love thy neighbor as thyself..."" for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, ""commandmentS""—plural. Immediately proceeding ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" He says the first and greatest commandment is ""You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."" [Following is the second greatest commandment] ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? —They actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden.   People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CAN—there is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birth—this is what's called ""our cross to bare""... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.  And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this.   Peace.",0,2
674,"To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is ""only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ""—not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslims—it's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera—oh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.  Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman—it is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)—and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in God—hey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choice—no one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like that—it is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing.   Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame?   ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)  Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religion—the majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words.",0,2
675,"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.",0,1
676,"""If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""   I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.  Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.  Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.  This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.  I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene.   The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool.",0,1
677,"I can't talk in depth as I'm at work, but suffice to say that is an extremely simple interpretation of evolution.  Check out  genetic drift .  My argument is slightly different. I was actually trying to say that there isn't a ""gay gene."" My intepretation of it is that there is a gene that controls hormone balance during pregnancy, which can sometimes become faulty and cause homosexuality. It is the fault of an evolved gene, but not a gene exclusively causing homosexuality. Hope that clears it up.",0,1
678,"That's not really accurate, no. Your body doesn't fight against the production of a male featus.

680,"Gay marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase ""gay marriage"" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.  The phrase ""gay marriage"" is itself an attack on the traditional meaning of the word ""marriage"". The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.  Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.  A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.  The new practice of what may be called a ""homosexual union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.  In particular, the practice of calling this ""gay marriage"" does harm both to the word ""gay"", and to the word ""marriage"", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""gay"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""happy""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.  It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.  In conclusion, the phrase ""gay marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""gay marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word ""marriage"" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be ""homosexual union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"". Finally, by unequivocating the meaning of the words used, much unnecessary disagreement and wasted debate could be avoided.",0,2
681,"Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.  As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.  But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word ""marriage"". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.  If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation.   What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.  In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!  When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood.",0,2
682,"Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples ""marriage"", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.  I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.  Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.  Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.  I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.  If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.  This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.  As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.  My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term ""gay marriage"", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.  This speaker did not state ""that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'"" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called ""gay marriage"" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction.",0,2
683,"I have not ""derided another's love as unworthy"" as you claim.  My argument is not ""nothing but a thinly veiled gay bashing."" as you claim. I have used only logic and reason in my arguments. You're statement on the other hand is tantamount to calling me a gay basher; it is slander and it is libelous, it is personally hurtful and i would ask that you refrain from ad homonim attacks, and confine yourself to the more respected tools of argument.  If you believe that i am a ""gay basher"" then i say you have me confused with someone else.  In any event, i would ask that you not resort to personal attacks, especially when this is a forum for arguing for or against a particular question, and this does not necessarily reflect ones personal views but is an exercize in public debate methods, as I'm sure you are aware of.",0,2
684,"Instead of wasting my time and replying to everyone about my mistake, im going to state it here.   I should have been more clearer with my argument. I should had said that homosexuals are  not totally wrong  and  not totally right.  Saying that they are will make the contradicting truth false. With this information, im believing that the truth can be contradicting. Contradictions are examples of false information. However, when i evaluate the contradiction i provided, both of them are truthful in their own senses. I went a little off topic but if the author intended us to talk about children, then my argument shouldn't be dismissed.   Now here is my answer to this debate:   Why not? It is a choice and everybody deserves to get married to the ones they love.",1,1
685,"I think the author of this debate should change the word ""homos"" to ""homosexuals."" It sounds insulting.   Anyway, here is my dispute.    And you are telling them what their purpost in life is.   I believe that the purpose in life is to grow and advance. In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation. However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers. I believe this is the purpose of life because it is programmed in our heads. We fear the tip of the blame touching our heart because we do not want to die. We go to school because we want to better ourselves. If i had a billion dollars, i don't want to spend the rest of my life playing on my Nintendo Wii. If i do that, i would feel like im wasting my own life. I believe i can say the same about you because i can sense it. I can sense wrong, ha ha.   Therefore, i believe, MOST men and women must be attracted to each other to inorder to grow and advane as a human race.",1,2
686,"Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other.    I never implied that.    As do I. But it is not right for me to dictate my SUBJECTIVE beliefs onto others out of some perverted sense of duty. That is absurd.   I believe this ""belief"" is truth and the truth must be said.   Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other   I don't find what you stated as a dispute. If it was intended to be one. if it was intended to be a dispute then you are wrong because when i stated ""growing in numbers"" i didn't meant adoption. I meant producing children into this world.   In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children. In that sense, it is naturally wrong. In another sense, it is right to be homosexuals because you can stop overpopulation. These are two contradicting statements showed by ReventonRage and RiceD. However, these statements are truthful in their own perspective. I understand that homosexuals can't have kids. They can adopt children and thus, support the advancement of the human race. Homosexuals, like non-homosexuals, can become scientists and mathmaticians that supports the advancment of the human race. Im just providing more senses in which being a homosexual is right.   You know what? I proved that facts can be contradicting. Homosexuals can't produce children and in that sense, it is wrong. However, they stop the world from overpopulation. In that sense, it is right. I know those statements are contradicting but i can't deny that both of them are correct in their own little perspectives.  Edit. If you read my other comments then you will already know that i think i went a little off topic with mine. I thought marriage meant having children so that is why i went into the discussion of children. Therefore, the discussion of children lead me to the purpose of life. If the author of this debate didn't meant marriage as in having children afterwards, then my comment should be dismissed. Ignored but not forgotten. lol.   It is contradicting. Im surprised myself. I said that a lot. However, i can say the same for non-homosexual people as well. They support life and they don't support life. Im just saying this so you don't imply that i don't think this.",1,1
687,I already gave examples of why is it wrong. It is wrong because of overpopulaton.   And i think my recent argument to you already answered this argument and the other argument that i didn't reply too.,1,2
688,"It is not wrong to get ""married."" However, in that logic and mind, it is wrong to live in a perspective of not producing children when overpopulation isn't met. It is ""naturally wrong"" to have an infertile body when you can't produce an offspring...in one sense. In stated this sense in my first argument.   When i created my first argument, the thought of marriage didn't come to mind. I understand that is weird because that word is in the title of this debate. And i find it weird. I replied supportingly, but not one hundred percent supportingly, that men and women should be attracted to each other. I comment that i supported is that of Shadowwolf when he stated that men and women should fall in love. In response, ignorantly percieved that comment as that men and women should be attracted to one another.   I provided senses in which this attraction is right and wrong.  Edit. I now believe that my comment was a little off topic. When i think of marriage, i think of children. However, if the thought of children wasn't implied by the author, my comment should be dismissed.",1,2
689,"Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say ""homosexuals are not wrong""?   It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct. Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the ""truth.""   I thought it was clear when i stated that homosexuals are not wrong. What i meant was, in a simple perspective, that being a homosexual stops the advancement of human growth and advancement. This perspective is not being able to produce children.  The truth is contradicting. Evidence that supports the previous sentence is the fact that homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation. This is another perspective that makes being a homosexual naturally right. This evidence supports advancement of growth by controlling growth. That too sounds contradicting but if we overpopulated, then it may be hard to sustain life. If we can't sustain life, then we can't advance the growth of humans. Now, i am not too educated in all the problems that may happen due to overpopulation. However, i do think it is bad to use up most of earth's resources. We need earth's resources to sustain life.    Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you ""believe"" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   I understand what you are saying. However, you implied wrong. I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument:   1. Fearing the tip blade touching our heart because we don't want to die. (lol i said blame)?   2. We go to school to better ourselves.   3. Not wasting my life playing on my Nintendo Wii if i had a billion dollars.   I believe morality plays a part of evidence that supports the purpose of life (I can be wrong about this) :  1. Killing one or multiple people of your own race, human race, is wrong. Why do we hate or cringe our face at the thought of killing one of our own? I believe (but i think it is face on some levels) that it is wrong because killing your own kind is against the purpose of life.   However, this is contradictory. This is contradictory because we had World War 1 and World War 2. We kill our own kind in that race. However, i think that the truth can be contradictory. We had to fight in World War 1 and World War 2 to sustain America's advancement of growth.......I not to intelligent in history. However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us. Excuse me and correct me if I'm wrong.    How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?   hmmm. I stated this before in another person's comment but i believe i went off topic with my entire comment. When shadowwolf stated that men and women should fall in love, i took it as that men and women should be attracted to one another. That is why i went into the discussion of children and the purpose of life. I went into that discussion because the purpose of life is supported when men and women have children. If the author of this debate didn't imply ""producing children"" to ""married"" then my argument should be dismissed entirely due to the fact that i went off topic.   I'm not realizing this mistake.",1,2
690,"A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument   It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.    Ask me if you don't know the difference   I understand the difference. Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it. Knowledge is belief that may be truth or not but it is backed up with strong evidence. And the probability of it being truth is high. There is no guareentee that it is truth. I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.    Do you even know what ""overpopulation"" means?    lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.",1,2
691,"You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence    I did proposed evidence: Books and morality.   And i do get it. Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not. You don't need to prove knowledge with evidence because knowledge is already proven by existence.    Believe is never knowledge   That is true. Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact. However, why say it when what you believe in turns out to be knowledge after all.    WRONG. Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?"" Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?"" I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.    First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals?  Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter. And it is not only female homosexuals; it is mostly female homosexuals.    Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it.""   You are right. However, without people, there isn't a society in existence. So that is why i interpret society as the population. But next time as i write, i will remind myself, hopefully, of the difference.     So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Society cannot grow independently of population. Didn't you state that society refers to the ""association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship?"" Without people, there isn't a society. That is like saying a house with no family has family rules. And i mean of a house that never had a family in the first place.    It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.    There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism. And others that i already suggested. I don't think it is a hasty remark. An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed. But then again, maybe everything in the book was all done for ""fun.""   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality. I had stated, maybe not to you, that homosexuality can become mathmaticians and scientists. Those are clearly two professions that can develop a society into a growing society. And homosexuals can adopt children.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law. So i can fairly say put society and its population in the same hand. However, these two are not exactly the same.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue. In the first scenario, you stated a question that has no effect on the changing of the scenario. Second, you made a difference to population and society but that doesn't make my scenario fallacious. They are a dinstinction but not a total one. I say to you to go into a forest and start a family with two homosexual women and two homosexual men. And in this scenario, you cannot adopt children. Can you think you can grow as a society? No, unless the women are allowing the men to impregnate themselves.    You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the Jewish people?   Im wrong for taking Hitler's life because that is against morality itself. Morality doesn't want me to kill another one of my kind. Morality's best evidence is viewed within oneself. Hitler isn't the cause of the most suffering of the Jewish people. However, thanks to him and the Nazis, the Jews were sent to the concentration camps. Of course, there are many causes. Evidence: well the best evidence i can give is wikipedia.    A rapist cannot try to rape a person. He has already raped a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   I should has said ""serial rapists."" But lol of course a rapist can try to rape. If a man rapes, he is known as a rapist. If that man against tries to rape, then it is a rapist trying to rape. I honestly believe your statement was silly to make. And your statement doesn't make my argument fallacious.    The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it might or might not be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   As stated by wikipedia, the policy came to be to control the population. I don't have the exact quotes from China's officials but it is obvious that the overpopulation was feared. Now in March 2011, the Chinese goverment is allowing its citizens to have a second couple. That is a contradiction to the original policy but it is still truthful. Again, my source is wikipedia.    Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   If you can't find the similiarities between the policy and homosexuality, i ask you, what are you smoking? But i don't want to assume you are a smoker. I think that is rude.   Overall, you didn't prove my two scenarios are fallacious.  Edit. This is a contradiction. In some sense i can see society exist without its people. I see it if i think of it as a concept. However, i don't see it in another light. In this light when all society's people die, i see society vanishing because there is no one to support it. True contradictions. Tho not all contradictions are true.",1,2
692,"This is EXACTLY where you are wrong.   No i am not wrong. lol. Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)  In one sense, belief is knowledge if it is knowledge. If i hadn't have any clue about the earth's revolution around the sun and stated ""i believe the earth revolved around the sun"" and found out later is was knowledge, then belief is knowledge.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true. Knowledge is truth.    You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Too many people to carry. Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.    Contrary to your warped belief, it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   Im not whining. Your question was irrevalent. Why? Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.    First, that is not what you have said. Second, prove that it is ""mostly female homosexuals""? Finally, so what if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter all three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   Yes, that is what is stated. I stated "" If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that..."" What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals? Prove that how i stated that??? Because if not, that is another irrevelant question. So what if it is mostly female homosexuals...because i stated so. It is a scenario. I created it.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.    Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.    Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size. When i say population, i simply mean people. Take the people out the equation, do you have a society still? Without no eskimos, there is no society. And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture. Cool.     Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   ""Grow"" as in succeeding.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    Which is contradictory to what you have said.   In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.    I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.   You really didn't disprove my scenarios as proof that homosexuality helps societies and does not help societies.   In ways they do help, and in way they don't. Im not saying that homosexuals are completely helping socities or not completely helping societies.",1,2
693,"Which obviously makes no sense as a statement at all since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   lol it totally makes sense. Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth. If what you believe is the actual truth, then your belief is truth. By definiton, belief and knowledge differs. By mental thinking alone, belief and knowledge is the same when belief is knowledge.    Wrong. It is an opinion that has not been proven to be true or false.   By definition alone, yes. By mental thinking, no. Think about it. Beliefs MAY be true or false.    Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"". Population growth exceeds ""the normal amount"" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there is overpopulation. Population growth might lead to overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation immediately. Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I know that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.   No, i do understand that and i had implied that. I should had stated that but i didn't. But you hadn't stated it either before. You too stated that overpopulation means that the population exceeds the normal amount.    Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   No, it doesn't make it wrong. It makes it pointless.    Since you claimed that it is ""mostly female homosexuals"", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   I did justify your claim. The fact that you would even ask that in the argument that im responding proves that you are not reading my argument entirely.    I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I know that you don't want to change the scenario. And you are not showing how it is wrong. That is illogical speaking because simply that doesn't make sense. I created a scenario of a society with mostly homosexual females. Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.    Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a FALSE ANALOGY and you haven't disputed me.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me. You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).    Which is ontologically wrong.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong. In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.    Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.   Now you are being ignorant. My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong. I told two or three times that i went into this discussion because i implied marriage as producing children and that is why i went into the purpose of life. The reason why i still went into this discussion is because you are still replying me.   I replied to your criticism. I remember asking you countless questions that you never answered. And you haven't disprove my scenarios.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends. If society wants to continue for centuries, homosexuals need to bear children. Im ignoring the fact that you can adopt children.   If society is fearing overpopulation, homosexuals is beneficials by controlling the overpopulation rate. They are not the only source to stop population. They are just one way.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.",1,2
694,"No, it makes no sense. I'm glad you find this amusing because I certainly don't. If you treat criticism as a joke, I have every right to assume that you're incapable of rational thought   So if i laugh to something that i think it is funny, im incapable to rational thought? Didn't you say, according to your logic, that emotion cannot be used as a logical arguement? I laugh because it is funny, not because it is irrational. And why do i find it funny because i know im right.    What do you mean by ""already exists""? Is knowledge a brute fact?    No, it isn't a brute fact but it is a fact. My claim is google definitions. Like Newton's law of motion. He didn't create those facts, he discovered those facts.   Ok. I see that im a little wrong. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created. My mind was focused on facts like Newton's laws; fact that were to be discovered.    I have never stated that. You are putting words in my mouth, idiot. I have always maintained that overpopulation refers to the situation where the population exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. If you haven't read that when I've written it three times previously, then you are truly a pinhead.   I apologize. I see now the difference between ""normal"" and ""exceeds the carrying capacity of the area."" I was wrong.    A pointless analogy is the definition of a ""false analogy"". That is a technical term in philosophy. Obviously, you aren't trained in philosophy. That is still not an excuse for stupidity.   My scenario wasn't pointless. That alone doesn't even make logical sense. How can you say that it is pointless. It is a scenario. lol. And no, it is not stupidity, it is called ignorance. Everybody has ignorance unless he/she knows everything about everything.    I asked you to justify YOUR claim, not mine.   Claim about what? Claim why there is mostly homosexual females in my scenario? lol The scenario is what it is. There is no ways going behind it. Accept the scenario for what it is. And claiming why there is mostly homosexual females doesn't even make sense? I created a scenario; hence, there is nothing to claim.    Yes i have disputed you   Sigh. No you didn't.    Which proves that your command of English is atrocious.   You can attack me on my English anytime you want. However, attack me and still answer my question. This show the lack of your debating skills. And im surprised that you didn't answer my question.    Which is not your position.   My mistake. I meant that homosexuality can be beneficial AND not.    Which is exactly NOT the debate in question.   Sigh. I know. I stated this to you many times.",1,2
695,"You are again putting words in my mouth. I said that ""you treat criticism as a joke"" and therefore, you are incapable of rational thought. If you can't even understand that and can't read, you are incapable of rational thought.   No, i don't treat your criticism as a joke. I never did. And thus, you are judging me wrong. So let me say what i said differently: so you think i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laugh. Wasn't you that said that emotion can't be used as a logical argument? It was you. So you made an logical argument because of my emotion....   Why are you always contradicting yourself within the same breath?   How was ""Ok. I see that im a little wron. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created."" a contradiction?    Yeah, thank fuck for that. And I needed to repeat what I said four times for it to penetrate your thick, concussed skull? What a douche bag.   lol no thanks to you. I implied normal as the ""carrying capacity."" You didn't do anything because this was already knowledge in my head.    Yes, it was. You admitted it yourself.   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one. I can gather up more than a few homosexuals and a few non homosexuals, put them in a house, and make an experiment out of it. People can say that the scenario is pointless because it never has occured in society before. And i say bravo because that proves that homosexuality is wrong in that sense.   I never admitted that the scenario was pointless. I said your questions was pointless.    I don't accept lies, false accusations and irrationality.   How was my scenario a lie? How was my scenario false accusation? How was my scenario irrational? Oh, Thank you. You admitted that my scenario was irrational. Irrational is a term that means illogical or NOT REASONABLE. A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable and thus, in that view, it naturally makes homosexuality wrong. You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------   Homosexuals should get married. But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong. I told you this three or four times and you keep questioning homosexuals and marriage. I understand that this is the debate topic BUT i basically told you that im ignoring it. I told you, indirectly, that my first answer to this debate to Apollo, was miscontrued. But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.",1,2
696,"So why did you add ""lol"" in front of an already illogical comment?   Because your comment made me laugh. Ok. I guess i am treating it as a joke a little as i think about it. But not entirely.    I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   Nope. I am not putting words in your mouth. You did state that emotion can't be used as a logical argument. It would be best for me to show you the argument that you stated those words, but that seems difficult. Why? I don't remember the argument and i forgot the debate. I may look it up.    In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   Yeah i agree. There is no difference between the two in Physics either.    This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.    It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals. I haven't read of any society that composed of mostly female homosexuals in history books. It is a thinking scenario. A ""what if"" scenario.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   And this about it, how can a society survive with mostly female homosexuals? No children is ever going to be produced. This is common sense. Yes, they can adopt children but im ignoring that. Why? Because my scenario starts from the very beginning with just a few men and mostly female homosexuals.    You are wrong. Something cannot be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   You have to look at what im saying in the view that im saying. There are many views to look at. If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore. In another view, i am wrong because this death goes against my morality. I can't prove morality but morality exists. And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   And im not saying that they are completely wrong and completely right. They ""share"" a side of wrong and a side of right. Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time. You have to look at it one view at a time.    Hey idiot, you did mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.   No, i didn't mean to disrespect you. I called you thick headed because you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate as if we haven't discussed about it. That makes you an idiot too, in this view. And still, you say that my words are irrelevant to the debate. I told you, that it is irrelevant because i simply wanted to continue this argument. So why still ask it? Either you are thick headed and/or you are and idiot.   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.  Edit.    I have never argued based on emotion   Then why did you ""argued"" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed. I know your reason but you contradicted yourself.",1,2
697,"No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I really don't care.    Yes you are. I repeat, ""I have never argued based on emotion."" Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   You are clearly lying. You stated that i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laughed. Therefore, you argued based off ""my""  emotion. You did stated that emotion isn't a logical argument. And i never said you argued off of your emotion. But you argued on my emotion; hence, you argued off of emotion.    But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   No. I said that knowledge isn't ""always"" discovered, it is created as well. Im not stating that there isn't never a difference between knowledge discovered and knowledge created. In some examples, there is a difference. In some examples, they are the same.    I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   lol i don't even know how my words ""beg the question."" I don't understand what you fully mean.    I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the need for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Sigh. How else can i justify my assumption without evidence? Justify means ""show or prove to be right or reasonable"" as stated by google. Evidence seems like the best way to justify in my perception.    Really?   Unless those straight guys are going to rape those homosexual ladies, i don't ever see those ladies ever producing children. And you know what rape leads to...mental problems. And that isn't good for a society.    No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I would have to disagree with you on that. Why is it never a good thing? In some perspectives, i see it as a good thing if that person isn't harming another soul.    If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart   Morality exists. In order to fully justify it, i have to do a experiment with millions of people.    These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Can we please not get into this. I know that i didn't intend to disrespect you because i am me. You have no say because you are not me.    That is not an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.   I know what you are stating. I know the view that you are looking at this from. However, you did argue off of emotion. If you want to be specific, you should had stated that you don't argue off of my emotion. ""My"" as in ""you.""",1,2
698,"No, this doesn't prove the scenario wrong.   Why does it have to be only female homosexuals? I stated that it is mostly female homosexuals. The scenario is filled with mostly homosexuals because well:   1. That is my scenario and i created it.   2. It is going to prove WHY homosexuality is right.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------   By legal definition, there is a small gap between society and population. However, i am putting them in the same category because the gap is small. According to google definition, the term society means the aggregate of people living together in a small or less ordered community. If people wasn't in a society, hence society will not exist because  1. People create society.   2. The term people is in the definition of society.   You stated: ""According to the OED, ""society"" refers to the 'Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.'"" Without man, this association or society won't even exist. If man died, who is going to continue this association or companionship? Nobody would. Hence, no population means no society.   You stated: ""Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesivness and tolerance..."" First, that is a contradiction. You stated that a society is the association with one's fellow men. So how can it grow independently without man?   I am going give you a task. Build a house and don't allow no family to move in. Nobody is to ever live in that house after it is built. Is that house going to somehow, out of the blue, create family rules or laws? People create society. Society doesn't create itself.   You stated: ""It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow."" I agree that i can't say all societies have that desire. However, you see many times in history books the desire to be free, to work, to live, etc. Im not a historian with all the history classes i took, there were many times when mankind ""didn't want to stop."" They want to continue and grow through science, and technology. So i don't think it is a hasty generalisation. And when i stated ""conquer"" i didn't just mean violence. I also meant growth through science, technology, etc. That was my fault for not being specific.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true   You haven't proven that it is not true.",1,2
699,"Ah, yes. ReventonRage did pointed out a contradiction. However, both of you and him is forgetting the point. The point is that in one perspective or sense, it is wrong to be a homosexual. And in another sense, it is right to be a homosexual. I gave the reason why.   The truth can be contradicting but it doesn't mean that it isn't the truth.  I believe another point that you two are forgetting that there is a right and a wrong to every side. Being a homosexual is naturally right and wrong. Being a non-homosexual (straight male and female) can be both right and wrong.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   This is one sense in which being a homosexual is right. You must had implied that i implied that this is the only way that they are right. No. Another way to advance as humans is education. Homosexuals can become teacher, scientists, mathmaticians, etc. I didn't pointed it out because i wanted to provide a short but simple comment to Apollo.    This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.   I should been more clearer. In many senses, a non-homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race. A homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race.   It is contradicting but this is still the truth.  Edit. Homosexuals are wrong because they stop the world from populating. Homosexuals are right because they stop overpopulation. Those are two contradicting but truthful statements. In a ""sense"" if one person can't produce an offspring, he or she is opposing the purpose of life in ONE WAY. In another ways, he or she can support it. Hence people can be both right and wrong. Not producing an offsprings opposes the purpose of life by not increasing your own race in numbers.   In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D",1,1
700,I just wish Jesus would make his second coming and clarify if homosexuality is wrong or not. Im dying to know if God hate homosexuality or not.,1,1
701,"It is retarded to even vote to allow gay marriage or not. I support it but there is no reason to be against it. To me, it is like if my mom stops me from eating fruit loops and say: ""Gay marriage is now legal."" I will be like ""who cares?"" and look at her in weird way. lol  Im not negative towards the issue at all. But it is stupid to discuss it when it is obviously it is the right thing to do to allow anybody to get married.   This is what makes us ignorant to even have to vote to make it legal or not. Make it illegal and i will be dissapointed. But the fact that we have to vote when it is obviously right to allow it is pure ignorance. Sorry no disrespect. :)",1,1
702,I have no problem with gay marriage. I don't understand why some people are against it...it is not like you are getting married to a homosexual person.   This shouldn't be a big issue.,1,1
703,"I believe this ""belief"" is truth   Again, you're misconstruing belief and knowledge. Will you ever learn?   In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children.   Why is this wrong? You're putting forth an unasserted speculation.   I proved that facts can be contradicting.   Facts cannot be contradicting.",1,1
704,"it is wrong to live in a perspective of not producing children when overpopulation isn't met.   Do you know what ""overpopulation"" means?   It is ""naturally wrong"" to have an infertile body when you can't produce an offspring   Why?",1,2
705,"In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation. However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers.   Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say ""homosexuals are not wrong""?   I believe this is the purpose of life because it is programmed in our heads.    This is getting tiresome. Do I  really  have to repeat the whole idea about ""belief"" and ""knowledge"" again? Sigh. Belief is very different from knowledge. For example, as I am typing this, I can't say that I  ""believe""  that I am in front of the computer because I  know  that I am in front of the computer. Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you ""believe"" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   We fear the tip of the blame touching our heart because we do not want to die. We go to school because we want to better ourselves. If i had a billion dollars, i don't want to spend the rest of my life playing on my Nintendo Wii. If i do that, i would feel like im wasting my own life. I believe i can say the same about you because i can sense it.   How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?",1,1
706,"It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct.   A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument.   Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the ""truth.""   No it isn't. There is a difference between belief and knowledge. I've repeated this on this site more than thrice already. Ask me if you don't know the difference.   The truth is contradicting.   No, it isn't.   homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation.   Do you even know what ""overpopulation"" means?   I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument   You are making the same mistake here  again . You're misconstruing belief and knowledge. That shows me that you  don't  understand what I was saying.   because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument   I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality.   However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us.    You're wrong. Hitler started WW2 to control others.",1,1
707,"It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.   It can't. You won't be able to prove it because I will tear down your proof again and again.   Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it.   You  still  don't get it. You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence. Tell me how else do you want me to make it simpler for you? I have already given you a substantial analogy and yet you seem to thick to understand such a simple concept.   I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   Exactly. So don't try to claim that it is knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.   Are you that stupid? Believe is  never  knowledge. And therefore, your examples are cases of false analogies.   lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    WRONG . Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. I'm a Geography scholar, see. So don't try and pull any stunts with Geographical terminology with me ;)   t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life.   Which is a contradiction. Gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you?   If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only  female  homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.   Response to premise 1 :  First, why does it have to be only  female  homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the  population size , this has no bearing on whether  society  will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Response to premise 2 :  It is a hasty generalisation to say that  all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   I have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. There is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. As I have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. Again I repeat, I am well learned in Geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. We can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation  might  still occur. Furthermore, it  DOES NOT  mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. There still  will  be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time.   I have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. You are wrong on both arguments at the same time.   If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment.   You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of  most  of the suffering of the Jewish people?   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person.   A rapist cannot  try  to rape a person. He has  already  rape d  a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   However, i am also right for saving a life.   Committing murder is  not  a characteristic of rapists.   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy.""   The One Child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of Mao Zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it  might  or might  not  be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China  relative  to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities.   Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.   Wrong. That is only after the revision of the Policy. The original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. Did you know that there were on average 33  forced  abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the One Child policy? Please don't talk about things you don't know. You'll only make a fool of yourself.",1,1
708,"Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not.   This is  EXACTLY  where you are wrong. Are you so dense and stupid that you can't understand simple English? If you can't, then it would be beneath me to honour you with a reply, which I have been doing for a long time and my patience is wearing thin. Knowledge is what philosophers term as  ""justified true belief"" . What this means is that to be considered ""knowledge"", a belief must be  both  justified and true. If you can't understand this, then you are truly stupid.   Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact.   Wrong. See above.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?""   You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?""   What is the ""normal""? Be specific.   I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.   As long as you are not specific, you are wrong with the definition. That is the idea of ""defining"".   Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter.   Contrary to your warped  belief , it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   it is mostly female homosexuals.   First, that is  not  what you have said. Second, prove that it is "" mostly  female homosexuals""? Finally,  so what  if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter  all  three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   However, without people, there isn't a society in existence.   This debate isn't about  propogating  homosexuality, it  is  about acceptance. I am not saying that homosexuality should be promoted. What I am saying is that they should be accepted. Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   Society cannot grow independently of population.   Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism.   What you said is that   "" all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow""  . Imperialism only occurs with  some societies ,  NOT  all societies.   An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed.   Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality.   Which is contradictory to what you have said.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law.   Just to side track, I think my definition from the OED is more credible than any definition from the Internet ;)   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue.   I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.",1,1
709,"Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)   If your thinking has changed, you're admitting that you are wrong, as I have shown. My thinking is iron clad and my position has not wavered throughout the debate. Your thinking on the other hand seems to be arbitrary. Thus, it seems like either you are too stupid to cling on to a position or that you have been proven wrong.   belief is knowledge if it is knowledge   Which obviously makes no sense as a statement  at all  since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true.   Wrong. It is an opinion that  has not been proven  to be true or false.   Knowledge is truth.   Wrong. Knowledge is  justified true belief . It is not merely that it is true. It is also justified. To be considered knowledge, a belief  must  fulfill three conditions:  1. The statement must be a statement of ""belief"".  2. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""  that is true .  3. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""   that has been proven   that  that is true .   Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.   Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"". Population growth exceeds ""the normal amount"" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there  is  overpopulation. Population growth  might lead to  overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation  immediately . Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I  know  that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.  Gosh, you don't seem to be too smart. Check the dictionary if you need to.   Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.   Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   Im not whining.   And yes, you are whining. You arguments aren't iron clad. In fact, it is a sieve with huge holes. More accurately, it is like a tower of cards that falls at the slightest challenge.   What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals?   Since you  claimed  that it is ""mostly female homosexuals"", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   It is a scenario. I created it.   Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a  FALSE ANALOGY  and you haven't disputed me.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.   I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.   Yes you have so my argument holds true.   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size.   I didn't say that. I said that population  growth  means blooming in size. Learn to read will you? What a prick.   When i say population, i simply mean people.   Which is ontologically wrong.   And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture.   Since you're an ignoramus, I didn't expect you to.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    DUH...    In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.   Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.  --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---------",1,1
710,"lol it totally makes sense.   No, it makes no sense. I'm glad you find this amusing because I certainly don't. If you treat criticism as a joke, I have every right to assume that you're incapable of rational thought.   Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth.   What do you mean by ""already exists""? Is knowledge a brute fact?   You too stated that overpopulation means that the population exceeds the normal amount.   I have never stated that. You are putting words in my mouth, idiot. I have always maintained that overpopulation refers to the situation where the population  exceeds the carrying capacity of the area . If you haven't read that when I've written it three times previously, then you are truly a pinhead.   No, it doesn't make it wrong. It makes it pointless.   A pointless analogy is the definition of a ""false analogy"". That is a technical term in philosophy. Obviously, you aren't trained in philosophy. That is still not an excuse for stupidity.   I did justify your claim.   I asked you to justify  YOUR  claim, not mine. What an idiot. If you justify my claim, then you are supporting my view. Obviously, you're not. So why don't you give reasons for your claim?   Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.   It doesn't make logical sense to a person who can't debate.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me.   Yes I have disputed you. Refer to my previous arguments because, as I have said, this debate is over until you reply to my criticisms and stop attacking straw men.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong.   Which proves that your command of English is atrocious.   In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.   And therefore, you are ontologically wrong.   My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong.   Which is exactly  NOT  the debate in question.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends.   Which is not your position.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.   The same, and more, can be said of you.",1,1
711,"So if i laugh to something that i think it is funny, im incapable to rational thought?    You are again putting words in my mouth. I said that ""you treat criticism as a joke"" and therefore, you are incapable of rational thought. If you can't even understand that and can't read, you are incapable of rational thought.   Didn't you say, according to your logic, that emotion cannot be used as a logical arguement?   And I have not exercised any emotion in my judgement of your rationality. Furthermore, I said that I didn't find it amusing. The lack of amusement is not an emotion.   I laugh because it is funny, not because it is irrational.   Here, you are confusing cause and effect.   No, it isn't a brute fact but it is a fact.   An unasserted claim.   Ok. I see that im a little wrong. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created.   Why are you always contradicting yourself within the same breath?   I apologize. I see now the difference between ""normal"" and ""exceeds the carrying capacity of the area."" I was wrong.   Yeah, thank fuck for that. And I needed to repeat what I said four times for it to penetrate your thick, concussed skull? What a douche bag.   My scenario wasn't pointless.   Yes, it was. You admitted it yourself.   That alone doesn't even make logical sense.   Your analogy doesn't, but my criticisms do.   And no, it is not stupidity, it is called ignorance.   Ignorance is not a reason for stupidity. Moreover, your ignorance is a result of your stupidity.   The scenario is what it is.   Yeah, and what it is is pointless and illogical.   Accept the scenario for what it is.   I don't accept lies, false accusations and irrationality.   And claiming why there is mostly homosexual females doesn't even make sense?    Yeah, ""there is mostly homosexual females"" is  YOUR  claim, not mine. So explain yourself.   You can attack me on my English anytime you want.   I certainly will.   However, attack me and still answer my question.   I am answering your questions. You haven't answered the debate question: Should homosexuals get married?   My mistake   Not your only mistake.   I meant that homosexuality can be beneficial AND not.   Which has no bearing on whether homosexuals should get married or not.",1,1
712,"No, i don't treat your criticism as a joke. I never did. And thus, you are judging me wrong.   So why did you add ""lol"" in front of an already illogical comment?   Wasn't you that said that emotion can't be used as a logical argument? It was you.   I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   ""Ok. I see that im a little wron. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created.""   In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   I implied normal as the ""carrying capacity.""   Which is a completely fallacious implication. The term ""carrying capacity"" does  not  imply ""normal"" at all. It is a technical term in Geography which refers to ""the idea that any given environment can only support a finite population.""   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one.   This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable   It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   No, I didn't. The only reason why you say so is because you an obstinate fool.   But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong.   Which is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   You  are  wrong. Something cannot be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.   Hey idiot, you  did  mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.",1,1
713,"I guess i am treating it as a joke a little as i think about it. But not entirely.   No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I am not putting words in your mouth.   Yes you are. I repeat, ""I have never argued based on emotion."" Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   Yeah i agree. There is no difference between the two in Physics either.   But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.   I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you? I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the  need  for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   There is no problem with proposing variables  as long as you can JUSTIFY the need for proposing the variables . If you can't, you'll just be violating Occam's razor.   No children is ever going to be produced.   Really?   If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore.   No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I can't prove morality but morality exists.   If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   My morality even forbids me from killing species of animals  other than my own kind .   Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time.   No, they can't. That is still a contradiction.   you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate   I said ""irrelevant to the debate"", not ""irrelevant to our discussion"". Learn to read will you, idiot?   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.   These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Then why did you ""argued"" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed.    That is  not  an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.",1,1
714,"You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).   I have shown your scenarios to be wrong.   [Taken from my previous comment]   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only female homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.  Response to premise 1:  First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.  Response to premise 2:  It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.",1,1
715,"In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers   Besides the apparent contradiction with the fist sentence already pointed out by ReventonRage, this shows a lack of open mindedness on your part in suffering from the same issue as the first statement albeit from the opposite perspective.   Therefore, i believe, MOST men and women must be attracted to each other to inorder to grow and advane as a human race.   This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.",1,1
716,"Gays are constantly in your face sticking their sins into your face. Justifying their sins. Making others accept their sins. Legalizing their sins. Trying to make gay marriage and then legalise it etc.   Are they? I don't find that at all. Has a gay stuck his sin in your face? oh how telling.   If there wasn't any of that bullshit... with men sitting on each others laps in public etc. I don't think I'd say a word and let them be. Instead they're trying to get me and other people to allow them into our daily lives.   So because they do things that you don't like and they are not hurting you or anyone at all, you feel obligated to label them and protest against their rights to be happy. ""Me thinks the lady does protest too much"" if you know what I mean, their is a bit too much frequency in your protest when talking about homosexuals, which would lead to the inference that you are a closet homosexual.  Anything you would like to confess?  I think you would feel much better for it.   Lmao wut????   Peodophobe, fear of children or dolls, genius.   Anyway cockmuncher...  .....you're gay.   That is news to me, I am sure my wife will be upset when she hears it. How should I tell her? I am sure you have prepared your coming out speech, any tips? You can label me all you want, it only makes you more of a bigot.   The link you posted?  Kind of bullshit. Ever watched Scrottie Mcboogerballs? South Park where it shows how people read into things that aren't there?   Like hermeneutics religious scriptures of all kinds are open to interpretation, it is telling that some one such as your self will disregard teachings in favor of their own personal views, oh and I do agree with you on the South Park example all religious documents are misread generally because they are filled to the brim with bullshit and any cretin with a bent for justifying his own immoral stance quote mines from scripture then sets about ruining the lives of innocent people.",1,1
717,"Good so you agree that illicit sex is condemned by hinduism which means homosexuality is condemned.  Glad we got that over with.   What I agree is that the scriptures are open to interpretation by anyone, just because a conventional wisdom points them in a certain way does not indicate their intent. What I was also stating is that they are written by men, in this respect they are flawed.   Oh no! I'm a bigot. I'm so ashamed and terrified. Faggot   That is up to you.   And IM the one in denial.   Maybe you are, maybe you are not, but the matter of the fact is that homosexuals are here to stay, it is your choice to be bothered by them, although I don't see why you would as they are only living out their lives as they wish which is everyone right.   Ohh you're being gay again....   So by pointing out your mistake in the use of a word, I am attracted to people of the same sex, if you are unsure of what a gay person is I would advise checking it out before entering a debate about it.   Homosexuality is immoral since time immemorial   Homosexuality was a part of many ancient civilizations such as, Greece, Rome, China, etc   Homosexuality is condemned by 99% of all religions   Probably true of most modern religions.   Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.   Marriage between heterosexual couples is performed as both a religious and a legal ceremony, Gay couples do not get married in a religious ceremony so why would it bother you? Homosexuals are human the same as heterosexuals, should they not have the same rights?   Homosexuals are gay   If you mean happy then I'm glad for them and wonder why you are not.  If you mean they are homosexuals then there is nothing more to say other than Duuuhhhhh.   You're gay   If you mean happy, yes I am. If you mean homosexual then no I am not, why would you consider me a homosexual? unless your gaydar is going off.",1,1
718,"In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.    Not many had open gay relations   So homosexuality isn't immoral since time immemorial, glad to see you agree on that.  In ancient Greece the male form was considered the ideal of beauty and the ancient Romans were fond of rampant homosexuality. If there was no gay marriage then I don't see how it impacts now, do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery, NO. Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO. (OK we still have these things in some more devoutly religious  and obviously morally advanced:)  countries.)  But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments. The fact that in the western world that the only real opposition to things like gay marriage comes from the religious communities is telling of their archaic and flawed morality. Gay people can not help being the way they are, it is not a belief system, or a choice it is an ingrained hormonally shaped sexuality, and if you are not this way you should count yourself lucky. Imagine being brought into a world where the very nature of yourself is ridiculed on any given day, where want you feel drawn to without explanation or choice is being chastised by huge groups of people, people that do not want to listen to evidence or reason, they KNOW they are right and that is that, and they WILL make your life hell because they deem themselves superior and in the right. A gay couple can not get married in a religious ceremony, so if they are not put together in the eyes of whichever God it is then it should not matter to the religious if Gay people had a legal ceremony or not.    TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that   They are not in line with you mate, as I said before in ancient Greece and Rome homosexuality was rampant and anyway even if ancient civilizations are in line with you then that shows where your morals stand, outdated and archaic.",1,1
719,"How did it fall apart? Two people are standing by their principles, in this situation no-one is going to concede victory. But it is still fun to hash it out.

720,"Where do we have a right to be happy? I'm only happy if I'm not poor. Does that mean I have a right to money because it makes me happy?   Everyone that is not hurting anyone else has the right to pursue their goals in life, and the things that make them happy. If you want money in life and you work to get it, and this is what makes you happy you are entitled to that. This is a right that you have, unfortunately a homosexual person in some parts of the world has no right to carry out their lives with the same dignity and respect awarded to a financial wizard.   Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people, the fact of the matter is that some of the morals thought in a lot of religious texts are odious and out of line with modern understanding of humanity and our nature.   If person x believes God says gay sex is wrong, why would that change over any number of years?   It probably will not but the question is about Gay marriage and not sex.    Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom   Whether or not God said anything is irrelevant and i don't believe in God so I don't believe he said anything. Everyone has the right to religious freedom, a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony, one that does not involve any religious denomination, beliefs or rules.   And is it bigoted to say being gay is bad?If you believe fornication (sex out of marriage) is wrong, you believe that in all cases. If you believe gay sex is wrong you believe that in all cases. Does that make someone a bigot?   No, but it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.(The following are examples from the argument you are talking about)   You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.    I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers    Anyway cockmuncher........you're gay.    Faggot.   Tell me if this is the reasoning of a religious person or a bigot.   I'd be willing to believe you think murder is wrong in all cases, does that make you a bigot?   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   You are both arguing two separate points because you have two different life views.   Is this not the point?   While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.   Like I have said belief is everyones right and I am not in the business of disputing that, but it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.",1,1
721,"Says who? There is no written protection anywhere in the constitution saying so. It can be inferred, perhaps, but it is not a guaranteed right. As such, the majority can vote on this issue any way they like until the constitution is changed in a legal fashion (i.e. the legislative branch).    1. Life - (cf. right to live, right to life)   2. Liberty (cf. freedom, personal liberty)   3. the pursuit of Happiness (cf. personal fulfillment, professional accomplishment, basic comforts, human pleasures, luxuries, vices)   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   OK I do agree with you here morality can be subject to opinion but in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it does say:   All human beings are born free and  equal  in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of  brotherhood .     Everyone  is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.   It is only because of the time when this was written that it does not state Sexuality as it was written in 1948 and Homosexuality has only become legal in most countries since the 70's.   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist   See first right from Declaration. OK I agree again with you that the specifics are vague and do not include marriage, in countries where Gay marriage is legal those people have their rights.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   It was because of the name calling that I got involved in the first place, as I have said before it is everyones right to religious beliefs and I believe that if they want to go about celebrating their beliefs then that is OK too, where it stops being OK is when they try to use their scriptures to affect laws in secular societies by demonising Homosexuals and trying to change the attitudes of the people. I also have gay friends and family and I coming from a strict Roman Catholic house have witnessed the devastating effect these beliefs can have on a persons mentality and general well-being, there is a friend of the family that was beaten so badly for being Gay that he had to move away.   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder?   There is no logic in the equation as the two are far from equal, murder robs people of their dignity, right to life and robs families of loved ones and causes nothing but pain it is a heinous act. Homosexuality creates no victim or pain or loss of dignity, etc.   Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   Many people don't and religious people are entitled to vote just the same as everyone else, it would be that if they kept to this right and not infringe on the rights of others that their case could be respectfully considered. I can empathize with people from a religious community, I was one as a child, my own mother would rather die than give up her beliefs.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?   Again I agree with you on the rights of everyone to vote. I have no right to force my morality on anyone, I am not trying to do that. What I was trying to get across was the fact that not all is known and what is known is constantly being questioned, religious texts can be interpreted to anyones avail, and it is proved that they are massively edited, the problem comes when secular societies and religious communities clash.   Surely if no-one is being hurt then there should be no problem, if religious people believe it is wrong then they should consider the fact that a civil union is not a religious one, and therefore void in the eyes of their creator.   As for the fear that God destroys cities that permit homosexuality, I believe you are referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, did God not remove his faithful from these cities before destroying them and did he not pledge that he would  ""never again curse the ground on account of man""  after Noah's flood so there is nothing to fear.",1,1
722,"No it means that their morals can still be applied today.   Which ones are you referring to, the Greeks or the Romans?

Why should they have to hide and you not?    But sitting their justifying their sinful acts is disgraceful and disgusting.   It is a pity you feel this way as I guess it is only going to become easier for Gay people to go about their lives as straight people do.   My last point on this farcical debate is that Homosexuals getting married in a civil ceremony and being viewed only legally should not enrage the religious. Religious people regard their marriage as a bond put together by their God as this is not the case of Homosexual marriage why would it matter, as they will be judged by whichever God the religious person is prescribing to, which should make them more comfortable with it as they should know that punishment will be served.

C) Articles written by women obviously biasedly focusing on some inequalities. They never mention how men died in their millions so that women could live.

You want gay rights.. you best give all these sick fucks rights.   The treatment of paedophiles should have no bearing on this debate if you want to debate that I would advise setting up a debate on it.

I will reference you when I need to be a bigot.",1,1
729,"The dictionary isn't always right. The dictionary is written by a bunch of people that give the definition of words as they see it   And religious scripture is written by God, right?   Go to a country with morals and you'll see that marriage is between man and wife and that it is a religious ceremony.   I feel your idea of morality is twisted, please name a country with morals or one without for that fact.   You cannot have a man and man or woman and woman or transexual and transexual   Why exactly can you not have these?   or brother and sister or brother and father or brother and mother or sister and father or sister and mother or sister and sister or brother and brother   By law siblings can not marry each other, this not the same as Homosexuality, incestuous behavior can create seriously deficient children therefore there is still a victim. Also there is not many siblings or parents of children wanting to marry each other, I am sure that there is very little people actually attracted to their siblings or parents, and should bare no mention in a debate on the right of two consenting adults to spend their lives together. Plus this is not the subject being debated.   or pedophile and young person or dead body and necrophile or a dog and a bestiality person.   Again victims involved so immoral.   Lol you being serious?   Was it not you that was harping on about the fact that Christianity and Islam are the only religions discussed/ considered in these debates, in an argument with me recently.  Buddism is not against homosexuality, Neither is Hinduism Shinto does not outline any problems with it. And as for immoral it is only in the eyes of those too consumed in their own shit to ever empathize with another human.   Blah blah blah anybody that isn't accepting of all types of peoples is a bigot. Have fun advocating paedophilia.      The term bigot is ambiguous it can also mean one that is strongly partial to ones own group, etc, etc. Why would I advocate paedophillia, it wrong and immoral, Now, empathizing with a pedophile is something I could do, something I see from your post you will never do or be able to do.   I'm not going to bother claling you a sick fuck cause I think all of you guys know you are...  I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers.  Ohhhh, touchy, your name calling is sooooooooooo hurtful I think I might cry.  Explain to me why you brand me a queer? or a sick fuck?    This is where it might hurt your head   My head was OK, but thanks for the warning, your logical deduction is unique to say the least.",1,1

731,"Mhm, and I can logically argue that there is no logical reason for heterosexuals to engage in heterosexual activity if I choose.  There is nothing ""logical"" about marriage period.  And to hold one group of people to some kind of logical standard and not the other,  frankly is quite illogical",1,1
732,"Why do I feel like every person with the Roman torture device avatar is the same guy with a new name? You all say the same stuff and you never understand what anyone else is saying to you.  Here, I'm going to blow your mind.  If a gay guy marries a gay girl... is it gay marriage 0.o",1,1
733,"Jake said:   It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be, children need a mother and a father to look up to.   Good job voting that idiotic statement down everyone. I don't think the source of that idea has been explored enough though. And personally, I believe in humilating idiotic statements as a form of social punishment, so here goes. Hopefully you read this Jake.  gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would  choose  to be gay instead of heterosexual.  that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.  ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?  I know for myself, being very comfortable in my heterosexuality, I would not magically  turn  gay because a law was passed.   do you fear, jake, that you may magically  turn  gay if a law were passed?  because that is really the only reason for your statement. if you actually think about what your wrote, I mean, that's the only possible end conclusion.  and if you do stand behind that statement jake, I have to ask myself, what kind of person would have such a ridiculous fear.  and I can only think of one kind jake. a closet gay person.  so if you want to come out, which I'm assuming from your statement deep down you do, then this is the place for it. There seems to be a lot of open people here, and at least one very popular openly gay member.  it's okay jake, be brave.  and if you do choose to not come out, that's okay, I understand it's a cold hard world out there for a gay person. but know this at least.   whatever you do, whatever you say, no matter how much you deny it, I at least will always know that, you jake, are gay. and I accept that.",1,1
734,"I did way more than ridicule.  See my post on the other side.  And you and jake seemed to miss the fact that, I wasn't ridiculing the fact that jake is gay. That's fine. I was ridiculing his ridiculous response, which proved him to be gay.  See what I'm saying?  Next, you don't know  anyone  who  decided  to be gay. You know people who were born gay, but who were told by society they weren't gay and gay is bad, so were in conflict for a large part of their lives until they realized they had been gay the whole time... like Jake :)",1,1
735,"That's ridiculous.  That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he  wasn't  gay, that's why it took so long to figure out. Okay, in that example, bi-sexual. But people do not ""turn"" gay because of outside influence, it's something internal, in the brain.   I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't.   Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay. Do you seriously think life is somehow better or easier if you're gay? Do you  not  think gay people get made fun of, discriminated against, and avoided all of the time  for  being gay? How on earth would you justify your opinion that somehow society  wants  you to be gay?   the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me   Again, how so? The only right being denied in this case is homosexuals Constitutional right to the ""pursuit of happiness."" Not to mention visitation rights in hospitals, or any one of the thousands of rights denied gay couples.   called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.   Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay? Yet you're sad because someone stated the opinion that ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage."" Then please, by all means, make an intelligent arguemnent for your side. It will be the first.   The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons.   The mormon and catholic churches, but especially the mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right, now some gays are protesting this by not shopping at their stores. And you call this ""hatred?"" Really, you need to think about this a little harder, or move on to the next subject.",1,1
736,"Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is  not  a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of  opinion.  It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against.   The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because  he  though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response  would not have even worked  had it been, as you said, me  encouraging  him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.  Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.  Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said.    you  said that gay people were  not  discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all ""black people this"" and ""fear"" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.  You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.  As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...   http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11102139    http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/ queer-town/queer-town-the-catholic- power/    Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because  ""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?""  And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.  And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.",1,1
737,"Wow, I was so done with your arguements. You completely ignore every point made by anyone. Then twist around words to fit in this weird idea you have that somehow gays are discriminating against  you  by wanting to get married. Then you start making up stories about your sister being ""scared"" of all the gays on her way to school...  At first I thought you were a sane, but misled person. Now I am really beginning to believe you are crazy.  There are no gays rioting the streats. No one's lives or daughters or sisters are in mortal danger.  You don't see how comments like that are even more hateful and destructive than just saying things like ""I hate fags?"" Because they really are.   Then you tried to compare gay people to pediphiles!  You don't see that gay marriage is between two consenting people?  You really need to write an apology for this entire arguement...",1,1

How does homosexuality promote peace and order? Greece, Rome - all the homosexual 'hotspots' throughout history have fallen.   Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality.

742,"From a functonal perspective, sex is designed for procreation to ensure the survival of a species. However, in contemporary society, sex is also a form of pleasure.

The same way fear helps keep people alive. Regardless whether your Vulcanian logic find emotions to be ""illogical,"" the point is they exist. Their presence is not accidental. The logic is we should pass laws that make society happy while not infringing on the rights of others. Not create laws that would make sense in a world that doesn't exist: an emotionless species with a population problem. However, the issue isn't about legalizing gay sex. The issue is gay  marriage.   Marriage  on the other hand is a legal contract between two people asking society to recognize them as a family unit conferred with certain rights (health administrative proxies, administration of estates, etc...) How consenting adults choose to have sex should have nothing to do with denying them rights. Furthermore, a law prohibiting gay marriage isn't grounded in logic rather religious dogma. Archaic laws grounded in religious dogma should not be dictating rights in a secular society.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.   My ultimate point here is that claiming Homosexuality results in the spread of disease is irrelevant to the argument because so does heterosexuality when done without protection.",1,1

Justifying their sins. Making others accept their sins. Legalising their sins. Trying to make gay marriage and then legalise it etc.  If there wasn't any of that bullshit... with men sitting on each others laps in public etc. I don't think I'd say a word and let them be.

There is no denying what I say about gays is true.  They're feminine (in general)  It's disgusting  You're not born gay  It's wrong.  You're gay. And a paedophile.

Aslong as that remains true then maybe we can do something to cure the disease/sickness/disorder.  No being a man is a lot of things but one of them is definately to be straight. There are extreme and I mean EXTREME and by that i mean  EXTREME!!  exceptions where a faggot can be considered a man... but in general the rulse stands.,1,2
776,Well IF science 'says' that your fate is decided at birth then I'm going to say it how it is.  Bullshit.  Science only points to an increase likelyhood of being gay. Never 100% definately going to be a cocksucker. A lot of the general 'science' is flawed and sometimes doesn't even give cause.  Sexuality isn't predetermined at birth. Anybody who says so is just trying to give gays a free pass. We should start doing that with criminals. Ohh wait they are.....,1,2
777,so even tough there is tones of scientific evidence to back my theory's up  Where are your links?

788,"Hello, Terminator. The issue isn't about sex. It's about whether certain people should be allowed to marry. I've been reading some of your posts and it doesn't seem to be the case that you actually have a reason as to why homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry.   Prove it.   It's simple. You can get married without the religious ritual. But you can't get married without a state license. The ritual has historically acted as a rite of passage, but not the actual thing that makes you ""married"".   Does marriage have a religious origin?   No. Marriage has always been a state institution, always requiring the recognition of the state regardless of what ritual religious or secular is attached to it.",1,1
789,"I don't have an information to back me up here, but I find this statement highly dubious.   Do you know what they say about the male intuition? Neither do I. Nor do I know who ""they"" constitutes. But people have been getting married since before there were states - as the definition and requirements have changed over time - and before there were religions. Marriage as we describe it now is a civil contract and not a religious one. I'm right, somehow, either way.",1,1
790,"No, it's is not.   Logic is just a way of systematizing or formalizing thought. You're somewhat abusing the term when you keep asserting that something isn't logical because it disagrees with your concept of what is right and/or appropriate.   Your desire for sex is simply instinctual need to procreate.   Not entirely true. In primates and monkeys, and some cetacea, sex is also used for mere pleasure, increasing the closeness of bonds and attaining resources or favors (I mean prostitution).",1,1
791,"I'm all for replacing marriage with a different contract that likewise incorporates someone into your family, just with out the religious and sexual undertones.    We already have that. It's called marriage. It's not a religious or sexual issue. It's a state issue in recognizing the merging of two families. The religious ritual is a superfluous (but meaningful to some) practice. It actually has no bearing whatsoever on the actual legitimacy of the marriage. And honestly, I don't see what sex has to do with marriage. If it was relevant at all, we'd stop impotent or infertile people from marrying. But we don't. It's only relevant when all these closeted homosexuals struggle against their sexuality and try to fight the very things they're doing in secret.",1,1

794,"Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent.   It's not that arbitrary, since consent is already defined in law. And the very basic requirement of a marriage is that there are at least two consenting parties involved.   If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   Well, homosexuals can make that claim (though I'm absolutely positive that you're oversimplifying their case) because the issue of consent is both de facto and de jure. It's already assumed as a matter of ritual and law. Showing that you love each other is one thing, but not running away is not a form of legitimate consent, since consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection.   There are a lot of ""ifs"" in your argument. But you're also skewing the legal definition of ""consent"" to make a weak point. Within the strictures of marriage, express consent is required. This means that a personhood of adequate intelligence can make a reasoned decision in response to the prompting or initiations of another and  come to accord  with said proposal. Your cat can't do that. Now, if you're actually willing to take the time to demonstrate that your cat is capable of such faculties, then you have a case. Until then, you're blowing hot air.   To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard.   No. I don't.",1,1
795,"It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent.   Preference and the ability to consent aren't inclusive. That, for example, the age of consent might be lowered or raised has no bearing on the legal definition of consent.   The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences   The law has only broadened which  consenting parties  can be married, the issue of express consent would still need to be addressed if your slippery slope is to be accepted.   If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference?   As long as there are two expressly consenting parties, then nothing should stop us from allowing other people to get married. An animal can't consent. And despite your efforts below to show that your cat can, it's  you  who's saying it's consenting, not the cat itself. You can't consent on behalf of another unless that  legal  entity legally acquiesces to your authority to do so.   Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.   You're purposefully ignoring the issue of express consent to continue your argument, and it's simply becoming disingenuous at this point.",1,1
796,"What are you talking about? If the age of consent is raised or lowered it does to have a direct bearing on the legal definition of consent. The legal definition changes to the new age.   You're conflating age of consent law with the definition of consent in law. With age, it's not the definition  of consent  that changes, it's who is permitted to give the legally defined consent that is changed.",1,2

It's really simple actually.   An implication of Brown vs the Board of Education, and subsequent integration laws, permitted precedent for Lovings vs Virginia as an addendum to Brown, amending the definition of marriage, institutionally, to include interracial coupling, as a matter of civil rights. Your point, as simple as it is, holds no weight. Lovings vs Virginia effectively trumps you.   Why does a different name make something un-equal?   You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal. If people are on equal ground, then segregating their practices and institutions contradicts that equity. If they are equal, then there's no reason at all to segregate.",1,1

Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature.   A large number of animals have homosexuals within their population. Nature has nothing to do with it. Miscegeny was also constitutionally outlawed in the majority of states, and it took a constitutional amendment to allow its practice to be legal. It's not surprising that conservatives have been using the same bloody arguments that you and people like you (oh yeah, conservatives) use with respect to homosexuals and homosexual marriage are nearly the exact same arguments people were using during the days of anti-miscegenation.    We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.   Which has no bearing on policy. And if it does, it's unconstitutional.   Homosexuality is abnormal.   So is left handedness.   Most people are not gay.   Most people aren't crippled from birth, either, but it doesn't stop us from making legal provisions for their equitable treatment.   It goes against my beliefs.   Of course it does. So what?   And I have a right to those beliefs.   But no right to turn your personal beliefs into policy. That, my friend, is unconstitutional - certainly if it's religious.

I think that you would agree that this would be a very spiteful and hateful thing to do. Now, are you telling me that you want to try and change those people's mind and remain living there. Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that just because a law is passed that people all of the sudden are going to change their mind and stop hating you? And you really want to keep living there? Knowing that you are hated and despised for forcing something down their throats? Something they didn't want?

By  forcing people  who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance a fight will break out. You claim that it is wrong for people to  forcing gays  into a situation where they can't get married but you have no qualms about  forcing people  into accepting gays. WTF, soccer?

Why is it a one way street with you?  Just because ""gays want to get married"" does not make it  a right , nor does it make it  morally right  (or wrong for that matter), nor do gays necessarily suffer if they don't get to marry.  The fact that ""gays being allowed to marry doesn't hurt anyone"" is not a logical argument for gay marriage because I can just as easily say, ""It doesn't hurt anyone if gays don't get married.""   There are savages living in the bush that don't know from marriage as we know it. They live together, do what comes naturally, and that's that. they don't have a piece of paper that says they are married.  If a gay couple do not have a piece of paper that says that they are married, how are they hurt? They are not hurt. They just don't get ""extra"" benefits. If I have a piece of candy and you want it and I don't give it to you, you are not hurt, you just don't have a piece of candy, you don't have something extra, you don't have something you didn't have to begin with. So how are you hurt?  Now, if I take something away from you, then you have a legitimate gripe. These marriage benefits are not taken away from gays. These marriage benefits are just  not given  to gay couples. If gays want those benefits then fight for those benefits. But don't give me some sob story about how gays are hurt because you aren't given something they want.  Oh, but they want the same thing as heterosexual couples. Hell, I want a million dollars. CEO's get a million dollars all the time. Am I hurt because I'm not given a million dollars? Am I right in asking for a million dollars? I never had a million dollars before. Do I have a right to a million dollars? Am I suffering? Does it hurt anyone if I were given a million dollars? Why can't I have my million dollars? Maybe I should just figure out how to get a million dollars on my own. WOW!!! What a freaking concept!!! I have control over getting a million dollars!!! And I'm willing to bet every penny of it that once I get it, it wont necessarily make me any happier than I am already, right now.  This crap about wanting to express their love in front of friends and family can be expressed without a legal piece of paper.

Don't recognize a person's right to tell you ""no."" If you stand there and argue with that person, then you have just recognized their right to tell you ""no"" and you are now trying to change their their mind to say ""yes"" so that they let you do whatever it is you want to do.   Basically what I'm saying is that the way gays have been going about fighting for their rights recognizes the opposition's right to say ""no.""  Now, I agree with and support this:  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.  I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on and they will therefore fight back. In other words, it legitimizes their right to oppose same sex marriage and gives them reason to fight back.  I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights. The federal government has way too much power.  Now, I did not say that gays are unreasonable for wanting same sex marriage. I am saying that if they are trying to follow scenarios one and two above, they are being unreasonable in the way they are pursuing it.   The argument that ""it doesn't affect any straight couple"" doesn't work because anyone could say, ""And? So what? Who cares? The majority has voted. They don't want it!""  The whole ""African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted"" doesn't work because the word marriage has a religious aspect to it that needs to be separated from the legal aspect. If it can't be removed, then another word needs to take its place.  You ask, ""What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?"" The answer is: Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so. By arguing the point you are admitting/recognizing their right to oppose you. If your stance is that they have no right to oppose you, then you need not argue the point; you just figure a way to navigate the system or go around the system.  Now, lets see how ridiculous you sound when you say that gays have never been able to find an ounce of happiness because they don't have a piece of paper that says that they are legally married. What a bunch of crap. Do you actually expect me to believe that a piece of paper is going to magically make them find happiness? Come on.  Gays have been living together, spending the rest of their lives together, loving each other, expressing their love for each other in front of friends and family for ages. If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again. Those people who hate gays will always hate gays regardless of this piece of paper you so desperately want.",1,2
820,"OK, I'll go on record. homosexuality is  not  a choice.  Having said that, I disagree with any court that claims marriage is a right anymore than driving a car is a right.  When I say something is ""a right"" I mean a God given right. For example, the right to pursue happiness. Gays are free to pursue happiness. Freedom is another right. Gays are free.  The U.S. cannot tell me who I can and cannot marry because I am the one who decides who to marry. The U.S. may not recognize my marriage but that doesn't impede on my decision (who to marry) nor does it impede my happiness. The only thing it impedes is any benefits I would be eligible for if the U.S. recognized my marriage.   A country has a right to decide what it will or will not recognize. The decision as to what it will or will not recognize is based on the majority. Anything else is just the tail waging the dog. A situation where the minority rules the majority and that is not right.  During the American Civil War, both sides had roughly the same number of people. Enough to sustain the war for 4 years. If one side had had more troops than the other, the war would have ended much quicker.   Eventually the side against slavery won. Eventually the North had enough people on its side to constitute a majority and end slavery. Slavery did not come to an end because it was immoral. Slavery came to an end because  the majority  did not want slavery.  Same thing with suffrage. Women did not get the right to vote because it was the right thing to do. Women got the right to vote because the majority of the people wanted it.  Currently, the majority of the people do not want gay marriage. If they did, gay marriage would be legal. I expect that to change in the near future. Any attempt to force the majority into some thing it clearly does not want is wrong.  The supreme court handed down their ruling. And yet, it is not the law of the land. Why? Because the majority does not want it. The supreme court's decision (without the sanction of the majority) is moot.  Now, you can go and fly in the face of reality and scream and shout, ""But the supreme court said...."" and you still wouldn't get any further than you are today. I, on the other hand, recognize reality for what it is and proposed an alternate solution around the problem. A solution that you said gay groups are pursuing.  So, you can dispute me all you want.

Gays should embrace their difference and chose to create a word that elevates gay unions above the divorce wrought hetero marriages.  The religious right thinks the word belongs to them.

That usually goes a long way towards saving face later on if the assumption proves to be wrong.  Your argument is also based on emotion and it thus tries to manipulate the reader's feelings. This is done by calling one group bad; the straight people. You do do this by saying that ""straight people think they are more than we are."" You then call the other group good; the gay people. You do this by saying ""We wish it to mean exactly what the word 'Marriage' connotes and carries with it.""  I prefer arguments that are based on data and let the reader decide. There is no way to prove that gays wish marriage to mean exactly what it connotes and carries with it. There is also no way to prove that straight people think they are more than gays. Nor is there a way to prove that that's why they want a copyright on the word.",1,1
854,"Now, my view on the topic itself. I have three points:  Point one: I am a purist and I want the word 'marriage' to mean exactly what those who invented the word years ago defined it to be, ""A civil union between a man and a woman."" I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals.""     Point two: Just because someone wants something doesn't mean that they are entitled to it. So, no matter how noble gays may be, no matter how important the word is to them, they are not entitled to it.  Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word. But trying to force someone into doing something they don't want usually results in them resisting with equal or greater force.  I thus propose that gays create a new word and stop this ""war.""",1,1

If gays feel that they need the word in order to be accepted, then they are misguided because you can't legislate acceptance. Even if they get to use the word, they wont necessarily be accepted by those who believe they shouldn't be allowed the same rights as heterosexual married couples. If gays just want the same rights as heterosexual married couples, then they should just call it something else and stop this ""war.""",1,1

Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word. The racists tried to change the definition of the word and lost. As they should have.  Now a new group wants to change the definition of the word once again and they should lose that battle but they should win the battle to get their rights.",1,1
857,"I never said anything about marriage traditionally being an equal union. I said that it was a union between a man and a woman and that part has remained constant. But I like the way you twisted my words in order to call me naive.  Now you insinuate that heterosexuals consider homosexuals as subhumans and thus don't want them to marry. That's an assumption. You're assuming to know  ""the real reason""  why some heterosexuals don't want to allow homosexuals to use the word marriage. Heterosexuals say that the reason they don't want gays to marry is because marriage has traditionally been a union between a man and a woman. You seem to be calling these heterosexuals liars and racists who consider gays to be subhuman.  So, to recap, your argument is based on discrediting me by calling me naive and appealing to the reader's emotions by insinuating that heterosexuals are racists. I tend to find these types of arguments as weak. I mean, name calling and trying to manipulate people's emotions instead of letting your argument stand alone on its merit is weak.  I understand your argument that the word marriage has changed in definition over time and thus there's a precedence for changing it once again. But the changes you site are minor and the underlying definition [the foundation, if you will] has never changed. It has always been between a man and a woman.

858,"As far as your ""separate is not equal"" statement, it simply does not apply to this situation.   That statement applied to the situation between blacks and whites. One example (for illustrations purposes) is schooling. The idea was that blacks would have their own schools and whites would have their own school. But since at that time whites were more affluent than blacks, their children were able to enjoy a higher level of education.  In the current situation heterosexual couples are not necessarily more affluent than gays. There's no reason to assume that a heterosexual union would be better than a homosexual union. There's also no reason to assume that by calling a homosexual union a ""marriage"" that they will receive a ""higher level"" of benefits than if they just called it a civil union. Therefore, the statement ""separate but equal"" does not apply.",1,1

This would give homosexual unions the same rights as heterosexual unions.  However, If the government were to take this advice, the churches would still be able to deny to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies. In this case gays don't miss out on any ""rights"" because a wedding ceremony [performed by a representative of a given religion] is not a right.  If the government were to use the word ""marriage"" for homosexual unions, then would churches be required to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies? If so, wouldn't this mean that the government is telling the church what it can and cannot do? Is it a good idea for the government to get into the ""business"" of religion?

Why is that? Probably because people want what they can't have and despise what they do have. Groucho Marx once said:  ""PLEASE ACCEPT MY RESIGNATION. I DON'T WANT TO BELONG TO ANY CLUB THAT WILL ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE ME AS A MEMBER"".   This is also why the ""hair"" industry makes lots of money.

863,"The specific thing you requested was for me to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that.   You said that, ""I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue."" I thought I gave a perfect example where this was not the case. Some people just don't want to be around other people. That does not make them a bigot nor does it make them ignorant. Not granting gays the word marriage but granting them the same rights does not make one a bigot nor does it make one ignorant  nor does it hurt the gay community.   You say that same but separate is not good enough as though as soon gays are allowed to marry the bigots will suddenly see the errors of their ways. That's not going to happen. All the litigation in the world will never force a bigot to accept you. He will just look at you in the eye, turn around, and roll his eyes.  My argument does not call people names. Your argument calls anyone opposed to gay marriage a bigot or ignorant.   The side you're on is considered liberal. The side I'm on is seen as conservative. I don't categorize my argument as conservative because it takes a middle of the road approach.  Take a little  (your rights)  give a little  (leave the word behind). This is what I call negotiation. The side you're on is not interested in negotiation and is seen as militant; it's a ""my way or the highway"" approach and then your side acts surprised when they encounter resistance.  The side your on wants people to put themselves in their shoes but they are not willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other side.  The side I'm on is seen as being based on religion. I don't categorize my argument as being based on religion because my argument does not invoke religion. It invokes human nature. My argument is also constructive in that it alienates a smaller group on the religious right. It is pragmatic and rational in that it gets gays their rights sooner and all they are leaving on the table is just a word.  People can want all they want. I never said it was unreasonable. I just think that it is not practical at this point in time as evidence by proposition 8. I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost? Take your time, regroup, do a ""lessons learned"" analysis of what went wrong and why and then try again later.  People can want all they want but that does not mean that they are entitled to it or that they deserve it or that they have a right to it.  The status quo does not seem right to me. Otherwise I would never have suggested to bypass them. I saw an injustice occurring and I tried to think of a pragmatic approach towards getting what I consider important and leaving behind what I don't consider important in the shortest amount of time. That was my contribution. That was my way of stepping up to the plate and trying to fix things and I got slammed. This explains why others that have tried to help the gay community but encountered the negative feed back have stopped supporting gay marriage more than anything else.   What allowed slavery to continue was not inaction and complacency. People were working towards fixing it. What allowed slavery to continue for as long as it did is that it takes time to change the world.   The gay community is not asking for certain rights, it is demanding them. The gay community is not interested in negotiating and this stance is alienating a lot of potential allies. The gay community is taking an in your face approach and are surprised when the other side responds in kind.  The group that followed Martin Luther King were not militant. The Black Panthers were.  The gays that are peacefully trying to advance their agenda are not militant. The ones vandalizing churches are.  The gay community wants to portray itself as being the new civil rights fighters of our generation. The black community finds this highly offensive. What is the worst a gay man has had to openly endure in the last 10 years and compare that to what a black man had to endure during the 60's. There's no comparison. The gay community as the new civil rights fighters of our generation is an exaggeration; it is a tactic meant to get them what they want, nothing else.  No one promised gays the right to marriage. They can have their love legally recognized under a different name and not suffer because of it. They can be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness without the having the word marriage. The word marriage will not magically get them to be acceptance nor get them a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted. They have to find happiness within themselves. No one can grant it to them so no one can deny it to them.  I hope you see why I am upset at those hypocritical gays that say ""empathize with our suffering in a society that does not fully accept us"" and then turn around and vandalize churches. Now that is a real crime and it is not very accepting of the other side. I don't think they are empathizing with the other side, do you? I guess they forgot to put on their neighbors shoes.   Do you think that when gays call the other side hateful and bigot and ignorant that they are able to see the humanity of the other side? Does maligning someone help you solve your differences or does it hinder? And if it hinders, why do it. What value is there in calling someone a bigot? It is a great tactic. The Nazis used it with great success to get people to think that it was OK to kill Jews because, after all, Jews were vermin. You see?",1,2
864,"So by your definition everyone is a bigot, including yourself, because I can probably come up with a group of people that you don't want to be around.  However, a closer look at the definition of the bigot will clearly show that it is possible for a person to not want to be around a group of people for reasons other than intolerance of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own. For example, I do not want to be around people that don't speak my language because I would rather be something else rather than trying to make myself be understood or trying to understand what they were saying. And if we are just supposed to be sitting there saying nothing, I would still rather be something else.

The low road is a tactic used to get you there faster.  If I recall correctly, I did not compare homosexuals to Nazis. I said that the tactics being used are the same tactics that the Nazis used. This tactic can be used for good. The tactic itself is not evil. The gay movement is not the first to use that tactic. I don't like the tactic.

If it were a true statement that anyone who doesn't want to be around a specific group is a bigot, then why doesn't the definition of the word say that? Could it be that there are plenty of other reasons for people not to want to be around a specific group? What if you were shy and only wanted to hang around your own kind?

872,"Hmmmm.   I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.  God give me the strength to change the things I can,  the patience to put it with the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference.",1,1

893,"The right to vote has nothing to do with marriage benefits     I think it does in that a democracy can at times tend toward a tyranny of the majority over the minority – if women can’t vote, it takes a majority of people (or, as in the case of constitutional amendments 2/3 of both houses and 3/4 of all state legislatures) who must give them that right, and if a majority of law makers are not gay, it still takes a majority of those law makers to agree to make gay marriage legal.    I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle   I believe  you are right . I think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. – I think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. As I tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire US Code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. Additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. Even treaties that deal with recognition of US marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. Repealing DOMA would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today.   The only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts.  I think past compromises like don’t ask don’t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more.

I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights   do you believe each state should have the right not to recognize any marriage - for instance the states that had laws prohibiting interracial marriages?    the word marriage has a religious aspect to it    Actually, I would contend that this is a very widespread misconception. Marriage is actually just a social arrangement. Many religions have tenets related to marriage, but marriage can exist completely outside of religion. The government doesn’t (and shouldn’t) use any religions rules as the arbiter of what is acceptable in terms of marriage (we do not have laws requiring dowery, or that fathers of wife’s who could not prove their virginity pay the husband 50 sheckles, or that wives obey their husband as if he is god, etc.) We take our morals and our common sense and our constitution and some to a consensus on what should be legal – e.g. we allow divorce for more than just adultery because we found practical cases for divorce other than adultery (spousal abuse, etc.)    Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so   The right to be treated equally under the law is already being denied. Equality isn’t being denied because people are talking about it – it is certainly the opposite.    If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again   Equality under law is more than just a piece of paper – social security benefits, health care, tax and court treatment, etc. – gays are taxed equally but receive less in government benefits than heterosexuals.",1,1

901,"The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another.   That is exactly what I am saying.   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself   You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying. A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here.  from DOMA:  ""No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."" - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another.

FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states   this is where you are mistaken - the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state including saying that a law passed in one state has no effect on another state (DOMA).

925,"Force themselves into a club where there not wanted?  How does any gay getting married effect any straight couple? Your argument, which you continue to repeat time and time again, is ridiculous, and you know it.  All gays want is equality, and if the government stopped using the word marriage but instead used civil unions that would be  great . Look at this  site  that advocates equal marriage rights. It gives a number of scenarios:   We want the Flag of Equal Marriage to be complete, with all 50 stars lit up. We see three routes to marriage equality, as we define it:  1. Every individual state could pass a law allowing same-sex marriage.  2. The federal government could repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and allow same-sex marriage at the federal level, overriding all state-level bans.  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.   So here you're arguing a straw man ""gays aren't being reasonable"" argument.  Back to the whole ""joining a club thing"" and why it's bullshit. When African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted, should they have stopped?  In addition, marriage isn't a club. There aren't members only meetings where only married people are allowed to get into, and married people don't have to do anything for other married couples. Marriage is the legal (and often religious/cultural) union of two people who love each other and intend to spend the rest of their lives together. So allow me to repeat: how does letting gays marry affect, even a little bit, straight married couples? What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?  If this is the best argument that you can come up with for opposing gay marriage, maybe you need to reevaluate your position and realize how ridiculous you sound (even more so than usual).",1,1

Apparently taking away rights from homosexuals is more important. There is absolutely no proof that children who grow up in homosexual households suffer any sort of added mental problems. In fact, a court in Arkansas had  unanimously  agreed to overturn a ban on gay couples becoming foster parents because the reasons stated were, to be frank, bullshit.  The only way that we can fight homophobia is by showing people that homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight couples. I know you say yo don't hate gays, but why do you oppose gay marriage? Don't homosexuals deserve the right to have their love legally recognized?

In 2006 a law banning homosexuals from adopting was  overturned by the Arkansas supreme court unanimously . Then two years later the law was passed making it illegal for unmarried couples to adopt (and as you are aware from previous debates on the subject, homosexuals can't get married in Arkansas).  Obviously this will have an  effect  on more than just homosexuals, but the  intent  was clearly to circumvent the Supreme Court decision and keep homosexuals from adopting.",1,1
928,"No, you're telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights, and making the assumption that gays  aren't  doing the other things you mention like fighting for domestic partnerships or civil unions in places where there is no recognition of homosexual couples. You also seem to imply that there are homosexuals who have put their relationships on hold until gay marriage is legal... which, is obviously ridiculous.  First: the vote was 57% for the ban on adoption, and 43% against, so in no way is it an overwhelming majority of the population that is against homosexuals adopting.  Second: I'm not saying necessarily that people despise homosexuals, only that they want to stop them from getting married. Most of these people probably wouldn't be outwardly hostile (though some might) but instead just avoid them. Most of these people clearly have been taught that homosexuality is wrong and that the  right  thing to do is to outlaw the marriage.  Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?  Fourth: Things like racism or prejudice against a group tend to be because someone has never met someone from that group. By forcing people who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance there opinions will change. At the very least, those children who might have grown up to be intolerant will be more used to the idea of gay couples.... especially if their friends have parents who are gay. Just look at the progress that has been made as far as racism since the 1960's. People were against the laws that ended things like segregation. In some southern states it was even the majority that opposed an end to segregation. Go down there now and see how many people would support segregation. Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights, because no one should have their rights stripped by popular vote.",1,1
929,"'m not telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights. I'm telling them to take a different tactic.   What you are saying is don't follow the legal process. I guarantee if they had listened to your advice from the start you would be complaining about how they  weren't  following the law (which you actually seem to be doing as well, ironically enough).   If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.   By getting married gays aren't forcing anything on others. You could argue that allowing blacks to go to the same bathrooms and schools as whites was forcing racists to do something they didn't want.   And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Actually it's not me, but the supreme court that argued that marriage is a fundamental right.  source  Maybe you should check your sources before making claims that are demonstrably wrong.  So yes, homosexuals  are  fighting for rights. Not benefits, not to force their views on others...  rights .",1,1
930,"Again, spell out for me these rights for me. You can't do it ;) can you ;)   Marriage. That's the right. I already showed you the unanimous supreme court decision that says marriage is a right.

931,"I agree. Read this article attacking someone who wants people to rise up against the government to ban gay marriage, it's pretty funny and makes a good point.   http://www.cracked.com/blog/ orson-scott-card-wants-you-to-rise-up- against-the-government-but-in-the-worst-                                        way-possible/",1,1

933,"Well, in California, it did go to the Supreme Court, and guess what? They said gay marriage was legal! But then, Prop 8 was passed. The people campaigning for Prop 8 used fear to get people to vote for it. They scared people into thinking that their children would be affected by gay marriage.  The only way to ensure the right of homosexuals to marry would be to get an amendment passed. This would be virtually impossible though because there is still a lot of homophobia in the U.S. Also Church's, like the Mormon Church, encouraged their members to donate money and vote for Prop 8.   Honestly right now, religion is the biggest deterrent in this whole process. The only legitimate reasons against gay marriage are religious ones (i.e. sanctity of marriage) and of course this is a secular nation, so therefore they shouldn't sway people. Unfortunately they do.  To sum up, I have no idea. Fight homophobia would be my biggest suggestion. And maybe tax church's who take political stances on issues?",1,1
934,"You give the arbitrary definition of man + woman = marriage and say that this is the only possible definition. You could have been more specific and said specific man + specific woman + marriage, and then the argument would have been different specific man + different specific woman cannot equal marrige. Or you could have said same race man + same race woman = marriage and then the argument could have been made that different race man + different race woman cannot equal marrige.  The most logical definition however would be human + human = marriage, and then we don't have silly arguments where you try to use meaningless equations to make your argument seem more valid.",1,1
935,"Marriage must always be between consenting adults, because children are unable to give consent under the law; that is a seperate issue. This was understood in the previous argument when it was said that man + woman = marriage.

I am very glad though that you decided to keep religion out of the equation.",1,1

Turns out the majority of Texans prefer steak. Are you upset? Well maybe you just have a problem with democracy.   I believe that homosexuallity is morally wrong and I don't want it in my country.   You know what...the KKK felt the same way about blacks, so at least your in good company.",1,1
940,"1. Who doesn't?  2. The point is you shouldn't have to.  3. Once again, the point is that some decisions shouldn't be put to group vote. If someones rights are restricted, and taking away that restriction has  no negative effect  on anyone, then there is no reason to vote.  4. Wow, really? Here in Delaware we only have mush. (In case you didn't get it, I'm being a sarcastic dick here).  5. Do you disagree with my analogy? You said that you want homosexuals to leave, and you called them immoral.   Take a look at this  story  about the kkk boycotting halmark because they began making same sex wedding cards. They disagreed with how America was being multiculturalised (they're words not mine).  Obviously I am not accusing you of lynching black people, or using terrorism, but what I do want you to understand is that the bigotry and intolerance for those different from yourself is equally comparable. I know that your immediate reaction is to take offense to this statement, but know that the only reason that there appears to be a difference between your problem with homosexuals and the racism that used to exist (and in some places still exists) in America is that the former is more socially acceptable.  Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. ""Dude, don't be gay"" or ""what are you a faggot?"" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people. I'm probably guilty of using similar phrases myself, and I'm not proud of that fact. What I desperately want you to understand is that homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice. Some people are  born  different, and if we shun them for being different, make fun of them, and convince them that the feelings that they have are immoral, then we really are no better then the racists of our past.  You claim homosexuality to be immoral. When I attack this point, you hide behind a Bible and complain about me attacking your opinions. Then when I argue that there are numerous acts that the Bible considers immoral, but yet you choose to ignore, you say something along the lines of,  well obviously that stuff isn't immoral , and I would agree. There is nothing immoral about touching pigskin, or eating shellfish. However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe.  So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral? Please do not use the argument that lots of people agree with you...we can both see how that is not a valid argument. Also, I must ask you not to respond: ""that's just my opinion"" because that is not even a position. We must have reasons for our opinions, and those reasons must make sense, otherwise we are deluding ourselves.  I look forward to your response.",1,1
941,"1 & 2. You contradict yourself. You write off the meat is murder crowd as foolish, and then go on to say that ""Eating steak isn't morally wrong, so that's not a very good example."" Although I agree that eating steak isn't morally wrong, clearly there are some people who believe it is. Should these people have the right to stop you from eating steak? Should you have the right to stop homosexuals from doing what they do? The answer to both these questions is no.  3.  There are plenty of other good people who don't support gay marriage.   Just like there were plenty of other  good  people who were against womens suffrage or the civil rights movement or even slavery. Your point only shows that it;s socially acceptable to oppose rights for homosexuals, not that its right. The point of using the KKK was to try and show you an example of a group that is now infamous for its intolerance.   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage.   It's like arguing with a two year old, I swear!  Listen Jake, the point I was trying make is that it is socially acceptable to discriminate against gays. The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up. Your supposed to laugh not get offended (and you complain about PC people getting offended easily,   jeez )",1,1
942,"Says who? Why?  Your statement can't even be considered an argument because you just say something without backing it up. Marriage is about so much more then having kids. It's about two people who are in love making a lifelong commitment to each other.  How about this...go to a wedding. See how many times children are mentioned in the ceremony. Assuming it's a typical wedding, the answer would be none.  How about people who are infertile...should they not get married either?  Your arguments make no sense, and lead me to believe you haven't really thought critically about these issues at all.",1,1
943,"Children in many cases keep marriages together   Bullshit. Show me some statistics. If anything, I would say that having kids probably puts more strain on the marriage. I have plenty of friends that have divorced parents, so unless you can show me a study that proves your point, I am going to be inclined to believe you are wrong.  I agree that having two parents makes things easier on the children, but this isn't a reason why gays shouldn't get married. In fact, studies have shown that homosexual parents are equally as capable as heterosexual parents, therefore, if a gay couple were to adopt the child would turn out better then if they had no parents.",1,1
944,"Why am I a fool for thinking that?   Because you are calling an entire group of people immoral for no other reason then that they are attracted to people of the same sex.  Because you don't recognize that romantic love can exist outside of a heterosexual woman, and man.  Because you believe, without any actual basis, that homosexual parents are incapable of raising a child correctly.  Because when I ask you  why  these act are immoral, your only response is to quote a bible verse.  And most importantly you allow these baseless views to interfere with other American's pursuit of happiness by denying them rights.",1,1
945,"As someone who knows someone with homosexual parents I can tell you with a great degree of certainty that:   You are dead wrong   You also make the assumption that homosexuality is wrong when you say:   He might think this is alright if he is gay too   Of course he/she will think this, because being gay  is  alright, and the only reason people like him will ever be discriminated against is because people like you say otherwise.",1,1
946,The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community   Well then your eyes are closed. Homosexuals have been discriminated against for centuries. They were even killed in the holocaust. If you don't believe that there is hate directed at homosexuals then  please  check out this site.   http://www.godhatesfags.com/,1,1
947,"In today's society people discriminate against homosexuals all the time. In the classroom, at people's offices, in people's own families. Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.  You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights.   People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.  As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they  had to base their decision on facts . When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.  So now, tallblondebigotedguy,  what are your reasons ? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage? I swear that I am listening to your reasons now. Don't hide behind false pretenses of discrimination, or that people don't respect your views, because until you can give me your reasoning, all of that is irrelevant.",1,1
948,"Well put. I was going to respond but you basically covered everything I was going to say. I would only add that I never said he was a bigot for opposing marriage, I was talking about how he does recognize where the real discrimination is coming from.",1,1
949,"In fact there is evidence proving that homosexuality is genetic. At this point people are just willfully denying this fact because it doesn't fit into their world view. If homosexuals are born that way, then that means God created homosexuals. This is unacceptable to most fundamentalists, so they merely close their eyes, cover their ears and scream ""LALALALALA"" whenever someone points out the fact that they have been proven wrong.",1,1
950,"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas.   As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.  Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.  Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.  In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.  Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights.   No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.  I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them.",1,1
951,"Okay, let me first make it clear that I never condoned violent action as a way to solve the problem. Gandhi and MLK Jr. are some of my heroes because they affected change in the most peaceful ways possible. What I also liked about them is they both recognized injustice and stood up to it without compromise. Gandhi wanted the British out of India and did not compromise on this issue. Martin Luther King wanted equal rights for African-Americans and did not compromise. There is a  big  difference between not wanting to compromise, and being narrow minded.   You say ""Some people just don't want to be around other people."" This to me is a type of discrimination. If I told you, I am not bigoted, I just don't want to be around Mexicans, you would be appalled.  Here is the definition of a bigot in wikipedia:   A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own   Looking at this definition you can see clearly that not wanting to be around people who choose to be homosexual is bigotry. But that is irrelevant because   no one is forcing people to be around homosexuals  . This is what I don't understand about your argument. If homosexuals get married does that mean suddenly they are going to suddenly show up at your door, and when you refuse them say ""Hey, you have to let us in, we're legally married now."" That is ridiculous.  Of course legalizing gay marriage will not automatically get rid of bigots, I never said that and I don't believe it. When slavery was abolished, did it get rid of racism? When woman's suffrage was granted, did it get rid of sexism? No! But in the long run it helped  a lot . Can you imagine anyone believing either of these issues as having two reasonable sides today? The bigots will not change their mind, but their children will be raised in a society that is more accepting, and hopefully this will have a large affect for future generations.  Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.  I agree that maybe gay marriage will not come to fruition in the immediate future, but that does not mean that people should stop fighting for what they believe in. Martain Luther King demanded equal rights for African-Americans. Feminists demanded equal rights for women. Asking nicely, ""can we please get married, if it isn't to much of a problem for you?""   Of course what blacks suffered through in the pre-civil rights era was terrible. That does not lessen what homosexuals are going through right now. I know from seeing it at my school how much homosexuals are mistreated and outcast. This is socially acceptable,  and it shouldn't be . Progress will probably be attained in smaller steps but only if people continue to fight for their rights. Obama is the perfect example of this: in order to win the presidency he had to support civil unions but not gay marriage. Lucky for me, I'm not a politician. I don't have to temper my views with the current public will. I can say what I truly believe. If a compromise were reached in the federal government that extended rights to homosexuals through civil unions I would be in favor of that, but after it was passed I would go right back to fighting for marriage. Homosexuals even lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because they can't marry or even have civil unions:   http://outtheotherear.wordpress. com/2008/08/26/ spotlight-arkansas-gay-adoption/    I also have a problem with you comparing the Homosexuals to the Nazis. First, the Nazis killed homosexuals, because they thought they were, to use your word, ""vermin."" What the homosexuals are not doing is killing or hurting others in any way by demanding marriage. By denying them marriage, other people are hurting homosexuals. So who is more like the Nazi's now? Don't you think its justified to loathe your oppressors? This does not mean violence, as I said earlier I am against violence.  Speaking of Bigotry though, I want you to see what homosexuals have to put up with:   http://www.godhatesfags.com/   Is it unfair for me to call them bigots, or am I being narrow minded?  Finally I would like to respond to this comment you made:   I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?   And I can only respond with this quote:   ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  -Edmund Burke",1,1
952,"I just spent the last five minutes looking through my arguments seeing if I could find where I said ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" and guess what? I wasted my time! Don't put things in quotes as if I said them when I clearly didn't. If you want to use quotes copy and paste, I have written plenty of stuff, I'm sure you can find something that will go to prove your point.  If I am understanding you correctly, here is your argument:  People are not being bigoted just because they don't want to be around people.  Am I right so far? Because I agree with this part. Next you say:  some people who don't want gays to get married only because they don't want to be around them.  Is this correct? Because I think you might be right that this could be some peoples reasons. No one is asking them to hang out with homosexuals, or even talk to them so I don't understand their rationale, but at least it's an explanation. So so far we agree.  Now here's where your logic decides to jump off a cliff into a pile of razor blades after having swallowed a gallon of vodka and three bottles of sleeping pills:  People are not being bigoted, or intolerant when they allow their discomfort of being around gays to affect their decisions as to whether gays should be allowed to get married.  Is this the basic point your making? If not ignore the rest of the argument and clarify your position, but if so keep reading.   Denying others rights because you don't like their lifestyle   is intolerant and bigoted  . I may not like people with your opinions but I would  never  try to take away your right to voice them. Here is where the difference lies. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with how people live. I admit, I would be pretty uncomfortable around a man who wore nothing but a thong all day, but I wouldn't take away his rights. I could decide not to hang out with the thong-man. I might purposefully avoid him, but I would not take away his rights or the rights of all the thong-men in the entire state. Why? Because I know that if  my  lifestyle was not the popular or accepted one then I would not want people trampling on my rights.  Your metaphor is an inaccurate one for two reasons: A) there is no logic in a groups wanting to change the name of their condition; and (this is the important one) B) homosexuals aren't forcing anything on people, merely asking for the same rights as afforded to others. A change in the name of your condition does not afford you more rights. (I considered including a C that said your an idiot but I didn't think that would add anything to my argument)",1,1
953,"HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO DENY THE FACTS!!!  Jake, at this point you are being willfully ignorant. I have shown you scientific explanations for homosexuality on numerous occasions in numerous debates. You have yet to respond to a single one. Is it because you know I'm right? Is it because you are in denial? For God's sake (and yes I use that phrase ironically) tell me what reasons you have for believing that A) ""nobody is born gay"" and B) they only become gay because their parents are gay?  Also you are implying being gay is wrong...by whose definition and why? Just answer me once Jake. Enlighten me with the reasons that you believe surpass science and logic. Why do you feel discrimination is okay? Have you ever even met a homosexual?",1,1
954,"So because a homosexual family does not fit the traditional definition of family they shouldn't be allowed to have kids? Orphans who have no parents are better off than if they have two parents who happen to be of the same sex?  Trust me when I say, no kids are hurt by having homosexual parents. I know first hand and many researchers have shown that two parents, regardless of gender, are better off then one or no parents.   Also what activities are you talking about? A girl with two moms won't have a date for the father daughter dance? Is that the biggest complaint you have? If you think we should deny people rights because school functions may need to be redefined then I think you need to get your priorities straight.",1,1
955,"Let's stay on subject, okay? Saying that two people who love each other can't get married because it will open the door for other groups is a ridiculous argument. By that logic we should get rid of marriage altogether, this way none of that can happen.  Just because an institution is old doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. Actually, the fact that it is so old is even more of a reason for it to change. Our thinking has advanced since then and our institutions should reflect that . Homosexuals aren't asking anyone to change their way of life...they just want the same rights that everyone else has: the right to marry who they love.  So allow me to repeat the question you failed to answer:  How can gay marriage hurt any one?",1,1
956,I am no biologist so my credibility only extends as far as my source's credibility. In this case my source is the video I linked to which is made by a biology student. I have found all of his videos very informative and factually accurate and therefore find no reason to doubt him. If you want to check out his page here it is.   http://www.youtube.com/user/DonExodus2   Most of his videos are about evolution and debunking creationist arguments.,1,1
957,"What are you talking about? I was responding to the fact that truthfinder said gay marriage went against ""laws of god as seen in science."" I never stated my opinion as to whether homosexuality was good, bad or neither, either. I was disputing his ideas. Laws  should  be based on rationality. But how does gay marriage harm anyone? Truthfinder's answer was nonsensical; almost as nonsensical as your questions are.    And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?   I can't even respond to that because it makes no sense! From now on, reread what you type and think ""what the fuck am I talking about"" before you press the submit button. Okay?",1,1
958,"Did you watch the video? Gay animals help the survival of their siblings. And to answer your question, yes, there are gay mated pairs.  So, yes, I did answer both my opponent and the topic.",1,1
959,"I'm pretty sure you didn't understand my point, so allow me to explain myself. Homosexuality is found throughout nature, in numerous species. Therefore, calling homosexuality unnatural would be misleading (at the very least).  You are correct that we do not have the same genes as fish. But as I said earlier, homosexuality is prevalent in nature, and therefore must be genetic in all of the species I named (including many mammals, and some primates). Therefore if humans were not born homosexual, then this would make our species an exception.  None of this matters however, because we have studied humans, and homosexuality is  not  a choice. It has to do with a combination of genetics, and hormone levels in the womb.",1,1
960,"Wow, you're really grasping at straws here aren't you? Because women are mistreated and female infants are killed in India, we should ban gay marriage? Is this what you're saying? Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.  The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:  1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted. This means that less female infants would be killed and could but instead could be put up for adoption.  2) It would make genders more equal. If a woman can marry a woman and start a family without a man then this empowers women. It means that they don't need men.   Honestly I'm pretty sure that I'm not understanding you. Is this a joke? Because I can think of no other reason why you would bring up a completely irrelevant article and say homosexual marriage would exacerbate the problem. Hell, this didn't even happen in America! That doesn't make it any less of an atrocity, but it does make your entire argument irrelevant.",1,1
961,"So you're just saying that homosexual marriage will never come to fruition if acts like those occurring in India continue? Does that mean it hurts people? I still don't understand the argument you were trying to make.   ""there will be no homosexual couples in a world dominated by the women haters""   I'm not sure I understand how this goes to prove your point. It seems like you are saying homosexuals and women are in the same boat on this one and progress will need to be made for both. If this is what you're saying then I agree with you. If you are instead saying we shouldn't achieve equality for homosexuals  until  women are treated as equals around the world, then I would have to disagree. Why should homosexuals suffer as well just because women are treated badly in third world nations.  I am not trying to convince you, I am trying to tear down your ridiculous arguments. If I thought you were a reasonable person I might try to persuade you, but clearly you're not...so what's the point?",1,1
962,"So you're the one who possesses all the understanding, you just can't articulate your thoughts... Riiiiiiight",1,1
963,And that's why we live in a secular society that bases it's laws off of rationality and not religion.,1,1
964,"Says who? Do you think making gay marriage illegal means there will be less homosexuals? Don't you think that an orphan would rather have homosexual parents rather then no parents at all? Have you even ever met a family with homosexual parents? Unlike you, I have. They were actually a lot better adjusted then most people I know who have straight parents. I'm not sure why your so homophobic Jake, but I think maybe you need to be a little more open minded.",1,1
965,"""It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be""  Well what did you mean by this statement? How does gay marriage being legal mean less families?",1,1
966,Who says your definition of family is correct? You think that two people who love each other should not be able to adopt merely because they are the same sex? How about single people who adopt?  Family  is  very important. Explain to me why homosexual parents are any less capable then heterosexual parents at raising a child.,1,1
967,"What if I thought  you  shouldn't be allowed to raise kids? Would that give me the right to take away your right to adopt?  Unless you have some proof that children of homosexual parents are somehow harmed, then you are just spouting bullshit. I actually know people with gay parents. I would love to see you repeat what you just said to their face.",1,1

969,"wow, repubgal, that sounded almost human ;)  I think that you hit the nail right on the head when you said homosexuality doesn't affect you personally. If more religious people took this approach then we would live in a world that had a lot less hate. I think Mark Twain put it best:   So much blood has been shed by the Church because of an omission from the Gospel: ""Ye shall be indifferent as to what your neighbor's religion is."" Not merely tolerant of it, but indifferent to it. Divinity is claimed for many religions; but no religion is great enough or divine enough to add that new law to its code.   - Mark Twain, a Biography",1,1
970,"California had a vote on Gay Marriage, and I believe all three votes came out to be against gay marriage. California, who would have thought? I think when it comes to gay marriage this has a major ""Bradley Effect"".   No, it wasn't the ""Bradley Effect"" it was the ""Mormon Church Effect"", which poured millions of dollars into mobilizing people to vote against it, and millions of dollars funding TV ads to oppose it. Follow the money and it leads back to Utah.",1,1
971,"And if a gay couple adopts a child in a state where gay adoption is legal then moves to (or vacations in, drives through, etc.) a state where gay adoption is illegal, are there custody rights put in question?   The full faith and credit clause, requires that all states must respect the laws and decisions of other states. This way you do not have to re-marry every-time you move to a different state. Yet despite this, some states refuse to acknowledge gay marriages from other states, thus violating the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. There is a lack of consistency in this area.",1,1
972,"If there is a conflict between the Constitution and a Federal law, it is the Constitution that presides over such cases where the conflict exists. In this case, where DOMA conflicts with the full faith and credit clause, it is the full faith and credit clause that reigns supreme.  In 1808, Justice Marshal in the Marbury v Madison case declared:  ""So, if a law [e.g., a statute or treaty] be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.""",1,2
973,"Not only does it generally just mean that a state will recognize the acts of another state not enforce the other state's laws within its borders.   Nowhere have I said that it does any such thing, nor would it have to. A state cannot say that a marriage never took place, if it occurred legally within another state. They do not have to make Gay marriage legal, simply that they must recognize marriages which have legally already occurred in other states. This is all that the clause requires.   It also says specifically that Congress can determine the effect thereof   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself, then it would not be an effect by definition.    If my state says I can't buy alcohol on Sunday and I drive across the border does the other state have to not sell me alcohol?   {sigh}  No. This is not how the clause works. The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another. Say for example, that I bought fireworks legally in one state and brought them into another state where they are illegal to purchase. The new state cannot take them away from me or prosecute me for having purchased them.",1,2
974,"That is exactly what I am saying.  You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying.   Did you not notice that my first response to your post said ""Supported"" ?? Then you began to argue against something which I never said.   A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here. from DOMA:  of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship."" - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another. The FFC clause gives them the power to make this determination   No it doesn't. FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states and DOMA basically says ""states don't have to recognize gay marriages of other states"". It contradicts FFC. DOMA is an exception, not an effect. It is entirely unconstitutional, on multiple grounds. It violates the FFC clause and it violates the tenth amendment, because the federal government is not delegated the power by the Constitution to determine the legality of marriages, this is reserved to the states, unless of course if you include the equal protection clause in which case it would still make DOMA unconstitutional.",1,2
975,"the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state   To say that we must disregard The Full Faith and Credit Clause in a particular instance, cannot be an effect of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  No Effect =/= Effect  The only thing the caveat ""to prescribe the effect thereof"" does is it allows congress to determine HOW a law is recognized by another state not WHETHER it is recognized.  The equal protection clause is not the only part of the constitution DOMA violates.",1,2

977,The bible also says it's preferable to stone a disobedient children to death in front of the whole town.  Guess which passages is followed today?,1,1
978,"What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature   Ignoring the fact that we actually do find many instances of homosexuality in the animal kingdom and thus nature....  You're violating the naturalistic fallacy. You assume that something which is natural is inherently ""good"" and something not natural is ""bad"".  If you can show me where in nature we find skyscrapers and microchips....that would be great! Because these things aren't exactly natural either. Yet something like cannibalism is actually pretty common in nature.",1,1
979,"Well, first of all, preventing gays from adopting because of a religious law would be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution.  Secondly, we are not talking about 'coveting' the sons and daughters of other people, because we are talking about orphans who don't have parents. Even if we weren't talking about orphans, this makes the assumption that children are the literal property of their parents.",1,1
980,"The Homosexual community continue to adopt children! This is training these children to grow up and be gay themselves! Children are being brainwashed to say oh well look at my 2 moms or look at my 2 dads! it must just be okay or normal!? Children are being taught sinful inmmoral behaviors today that will destroy this country in the near future!!   Yes, because it's much better if these kids remain orphans. Besides the fact that there is not the slightest bit of evidence to suggest that children raised by homosexuals will become homosexual. Or that we even have reason to fear such a thing.",1,1
981,"Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt   This is complete bullocks. There is no evidence to support this notion. Studies have been down that show a child of a heterosexual couple is no better off than a child of a homosexual couple.   Even if this were true, do you really think a child with no parents is better off than a child with two homosexual parents? Such arguments have been rendered moot, long ago. This is merely a rationalization for prejudice.",1,1
982,I beg to differ. You can go down to the court house to get married fairly cheaply and quickly. Marriage is only religious if you want it to be.,1,1
983,"Except marriage is a legally binding contract. Animals, children, and inanimate objects cannot enter into legal contracts. So your second argument is invalid. It's another slippery slope fallacy.",1,1
984,"Our country was not founded on YOUR set of morals and religious beliefs. We live in a pluralistic society in which many religious and non-religious practices co-exist. To enforce religious practices of a particular religion, would destroy any sense of  NEUTRALITY  the government may have regarding religion. You cannot ban something because it is against your religious beliefs because not everyone shares your religious beliefs.  the fact that homosexual activities are  already legal  makes it seem like homosexual activities are okay. Marriage isn't even part of that equation. I don't think there is anything wrong with homosexuality and what people do in the privacy of their own homes shouldn't be any of your concern.  Gay marriage is already legal in a lot of places and those places seem to be doing fine.  Nor are we in any danger of running out of people, the United states is one of the most populated Countries (#3 I believe) in the world. We have some 300 million Americans with no shortage in sight. If only China and India had more gays then they wouldn't be so over-populated.",1,1

986,"I probably should clarify. I'm here because it interests me to know what reasons people have. I support do support gay marriage. In England the debate has come down to whether or not a legally identical thing (Civil-partnerships) should be renamed marriage. In my mind, both sides are being pedantic over wording and I think it's pretty pointless. However, if it was a matter of race, I would support changing ""black marriage"" to just marriage, so that's the view I have to hold here as well.  They're not crazy, they're Christian. They have been taught forever to overthrow their own view of morality and reason, and instead accept what some guy in a big building up the road tells them. I think I can forgive them on the grounds of ignorance. I can't forgive the millions of straight men and women that couldn't be bothered to vote simply because the issue didn't directly affect them.",1,1
987,"That's perfectly reasonable, unless you're attracted to woman. For people who are attracted to the same sex and are religious, it causes them a lot of unnecessary distress. I assume that isn't the case for you though, so that is a perfectly good system.  The bible says a lot of crazy things, that's why most Christians don't read it.",1,1
988,Love does not require marriage. You have not made an argument.,1,2
989,"They can be in love without getting married. You haven't really made a point there. If you mean marriage, then who are you to say they should be able to do things. Your belief that they should is no more valid than someone else that says ""Of course they shouldn't"". It being self-evident to you is no better than it being self-evident to them.",1,2
990,"Marriage has been swallowed by religion. Records of marriage go back as far as we have records. It is something that has essentially always happened. The main religions didn't exist back then. Essentially, we chose to have marriage defined like that in a time when gays were oppressed. If we created it, why can't we change it?",1,1
991,"So you meet a guy, you like him, then.... you get married and hope love follows? Or you love first and then decide to marry? The first way sounds silly, maybe that's just me though. And the second one involves love without marriage.  You seem to be assuming that every homosexual agrees with this point. Maybe they have good reasons and in fact do want to. You have no right to say what everyone else should want.  Now you have provided a little justification, which I agree with.",1,2
992,"Okay, don't worry about that bit, it doesn't matter.  You just saying you think they should have the right is the same as someone else saying they shouldn't have the right.   Also, there are many many gay couple, who really wants to have children.  But unmarried people don't get to adopt. And the gay's aren't allowed to get married. So their chance of having a child are small, if not impossible.   Unmarried people can adopt, at least in the UK and US, but google tells me it makes the process a little easier, so that's a good point that I hadn't considered.  Depends. Two men kissing is fine but I wouldn't really want to see them getting up to their private business. With women, I'd be quite happy to watch that all day.   Even kissing does bother a lot of people though, and I see that as being their own fault. Unfortunately, the majority of voters seem to be in this category. And democracy is founded on the voters wishes.",1,2

Since you ignore the sillies, you should also ignore the homophobia.  But I would agree that Churches shouldn't be forced to hold them.",1,1

If you do look, notice how each banning of homosexuality is nearby something you certainly don't follow. For example, Leviticus bans homosexuality and wearing clothes made of multiple fabrics. Jesus does say that ""dogs"" don't get into heaven, but also includes anyone that's ever told a lie. This kind of thing occurs at every reference to homosexuality, believe me, I checked. Why is it you are happy to ignore all these details? Obviously because they are silly. But why then don't you view the homosexuality stuff as silly?

That is Leviticus 20:13. I don't need to search the entire book to find something you don't believe. It amuses me that you didn't even look 4 lines higher, at 20:9 when you were demonstrating how well you know the bible.   ""For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.""  Murder everyone, even small children, that has ever cursed at their parents? That would require the deaths of millions of 10 year olds. I assume you don't believe this. This is in fact said in the very same speech that your quote comes from.   We can even go all the way down to 20:18, where it clearly states that having sex with your wife while she is menstruating should be met with exile. Seems a little harsh considering it is possible for it to start during sex.   Then it states things that have been dis-proven. ""If a man shall lie with his uncle's wife ... they shall die childless."" (20:20), so even if you have shady morals regarding periods and child murder, you cannot claim that everything in this chapter is true.  All I am trying to say is that you are choosing passages to belief and passages to ignore. Since you cannot reasonably deny that, I would just hope that perhaps you'll start ignoring the bigotry and focusing on the love.",1,1

That is my feelings on the matter. I don't tend to see it unless I happen to be in a gay bar, but that isn't often. While I don't really care, some people do. And unfortunately 51% of voters are allowed to oppress everyone else.

Are you seriously telling me that you agree with those punishments, simply because it was a different time? You think people need death threats in order to not do serious crimes? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for executing murderers for example, but people that swear at their parents? People that don't scream loudly enough while being raped? Do you agree with this? Will you not concede that there are things in the bible that are wrong? Do you refute even the things said that have been proven to be false? Are you so commuted to the defence of a book that you have never read that you will try to harm other human beings because of things you have picked up from others?  It's clear to me from your last post that you have never studied the bible. The promise of eternal happiness is apparently not enough to encourage you to read a book. I would suggest looking up Jesus's actions before you make assumptions about his life. What is it exactly that you want me to take into account? Be specific. Actually do some research and tell me what you want me to consider. If you don't, then I will continue to base my opinion on Jesus from my own research, and believe me, he does not paint a pretty picture.  I have started to get the impression that you are an idiot.

So if you think gay marriage is a good thing, please make your case and show me the merits of it. Because as it stands now when I weigh the issue the negatives far exceed the positives.   So here is my challenge to you; If you support gay marriage convince me that it is a good thing and should be embraced by all people.   Final thought; Insult is not an argument, it's the failure to provide one.",1,2
1013,"blatant attempts to bring religion into government   Hey got one;  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created  equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Looks like it's the other way around doesn't it? In America we ground laws and rights in the transcendent. If you don't like that, go get your own country or try China.  We say homosexuality is wrong because the Creator who gives us our rights says it's wrong. Not because of some silly conspiracy theory.",1,2
1014,"No, it's nothing like that. Actually, I see Avedomni over there has put it better than I can -- you're conflating description with definition.   How is it not like it? How am I conflating description with definition when I am talking about the order of something?   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to tolerate it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   I do want to force you to tolerate it? Wow! maybe I'm wrong but that doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.  You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent. Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone. Maybe you should be more open minded to the fact that they might not be morally equivalent.   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just is.    You wouldn't say it's a good thing? You just said that racial integration was a good thing and gay marriage is it's moral equivalent. So how is that not saying this is a good thing if this a part of gay marriage?    Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives. Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good. Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude.   Sorry, Loss of hope leads to depression and depression leads to suicide. Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   See when you tell someone they are born gay and can't change; you shut the door on them and say there is no way out; you seal their fate and condemn them to death.  I however throw the door open and say; your behavior doesn't define you, you can change and there are thousands who have. That's hope and that saves lives.   Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.   Oh there it is, the myth of neutrality and genetic fallacy all rolled in one. Nice job jesseald! Facts are annoying things aren't they? But waving the magic wand of neutrality doesn't make them go away. And neither does disparaging the source of those facts.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   Let me see if I understand you.   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.   So what do ya do with all those people who change their behavior? And why are you trying to persuade me to change my behavior towards homosexuality.  Wow! So you are a fatalist. DNA is destiny right? Oh wait, were is that gene? what they can't find it! darn.  By making this argument you deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul). Your argument therefore assumes naturalism. Oh but wait, your argument is full of moral judgments and thoughts. Darn! those abstract realities always mess things up.",1,2
1015,"That's funny I like that, however you are correct and thanks for making my point and one unintentionally.  Different combinations don't produce the same results, they produce different ones. Which is my point; they are different.  And yes all analogies break down at some point.",1,1
1016,"If love is the criteria for marriage what do you do with all the arranged marriages that occurred throughout history, are they not marriages by your definition.   This notion of romantic love proceeding marriage is a fairly recent development. It used to be that love developed and grew within the context of a lifelong commitment. We have just reversed the order. And we wonder why over 50% of marriages end in divorce. Before we remove a fence we ought to ask why it was there in the first place.  About equality; it depends on what you mean by equality.  About differences: it ought to persuade you if you recognize a difference. Because that's the whole point of the debate. Some people want to say there is no difference when there clearly is one.",1,2
1017,"Kinda believe? If you say marriage is nothing in particular, just a contract, guess what? it's nothing inparticular and it can be applied to any kind of relationship. If I want to marry my cat who are you to say that I can't? The logic to justify gay marriage can be applied to any relationship. And that should be painfully obvious.",1,2
1018,"Yeah, were all the same. That's why we have different names to show the similarities, like male and female, child and adult, old and young. Wow you are so right; there are no differences.  What do you call someone who is out of touch with reality?",1,2
1019,"OK, it seems my analogy was a little unclear. I probably should have used letters instead of numbers because it seems that some people read into those numbers the values associated with them, which was not my point. It would be better put like this a+b is not the same as a+c. What I was trying to say is that different combinations produce different results, they don't produce the same results. The easiest way to say it would be that two men joined together don't produce the same thing as a man and a woman joined together, they're different.   So my main point is this. Let's say we all vote and make gay marriage legal. Does our vote change the objective reality that their is a difference in the type of relationship. Does the homosexual relationship become a heterosexual relationship and vice versa simply because we voted and said they're equivalent?",1,2

1021,"Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent. Remember the demand for gay marriage is; "" because we love each other"" If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection. To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard. But to that I would ask; On what grounds do you object, your personal preference? How is what you prefer relevant to what I prefer?",1,2
1022,"Here is a thought for you. Imagine a large island with just gay people and they are allowed to marry. How long would that population last?   Consider Webster's definition of dysfunctional in regards sociology; a consequence of a social practice or behavior pattern that undermines the stability of a social system.  So someone please tell me why it would be a good idea to legalize dysfunction. Is that not the antithesis of government?  And just for the record. Homosexuality is not a person, it is a behavior. My comments against homosexuality are directed at the behavior, not the people practicing it. I love those caught in the gay lifestyle and want to see them set free.  And for those in the gay lifestyle. You are not a homosexual, you are a human being.",1,2
1023,"It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent. And this is exactly what is being done with marriage. The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences. Yes, I was using hyperbole to make a point. If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference? Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.  Just for the sake of humor:   consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   Me and my cat had a ritual; it actively walked up to the alter in my apartment were I was kneeling and meowed and I respond back with ""I love you too"" we rubbed noses and I said till death do we part. Then she meowed in response. So I guess we are married and the state needs to recognize it. :)",1,2
1024,"No contradiction. let me rephrase what you said so as to clear up the confusion;    Their lifestyle robs them of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.    If they want to do that fine. No one is saying homosexuals can't, they're free to form relationships, set up housekeeping and whatever their relationship demands.  What we are saying is if that's what you want to do fine, but don't ask us the American people to support you in that decision. Our Government was established to support Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Anything that works against those goals, like homosexuality, is well, against it and not in support of it. It's their choice that denies them these things, not the lack of our support of that choice. Or to put it another way, We are against it, homosexuality, because we want them to have these things, not because we want to deny it to them. Hence no contradiction  In regards the abolition of the things you mentioned. One of the purposes of government is to promote the common good. If those things aren't good for society then government shouldn't promote them and should in fact work to discourage them. Will people still do those things? you bet they will. But most people will respond to incentives and discouragements. If you make it easy more people will do it and if you make it hard less people will do it, it's really that simple. But some people are so thick headed that they love to do what they know is wrong. That's why we build prisons. Is it a perfect system? by no means. Is it the best in all of human history? I'm convinced it is",1,2
1025,"Thanks for making my point. Your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. You said ""Marriage is a contract"" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. A contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. And historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. Which leads us to the next question.  ""When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?""  In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report;  http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/                                        costofdivorce.pdf    So yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it. And primarily because marriages produce the next generation.  You said"" The human spirit should be without bonds"" this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil, not to mention the question of this debate. People doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society, it's why we have laws. If we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary. But let me ask you, what is more creative and productive, the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind? Before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write, with out which you couldn't have this debate.  Final thought. You said ""Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect."" Heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do. How is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say ""A"" is the same as ""non-A""",1,2
1026,"The point is that either one is not fixed. Laws can and have been changed, just like definitions. You are making an appeal to a standard that in the final analysis is no standard.   So my real point in all this is: If there is no transcendent; then all we are left with is personal opinions and might makes right (survival of the fittest)  Remember those lines from the Deceleration of Independence;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights   They got it right. Laws and rights are only properly grounded when they are grounded in the transcendent. And the Creator says that homosexuality is out of bounds. To go against Him would be cosmic treason and that is always fatal to nations and people; God plays for keeps.",1,1
1027,"We just want to be treated equally.    But your not the same kind of a relationship, isn't that why you refer to yourself as a ""same sex relationship"" and not a heterosexual marriage? Aren't you the one and not the other?   Our children have the right to have a sense of belonging without any prejudices   You are the one who denied them that by your choice, not us. Are you not comfortable with choice you made? Our choices have consequences. If you made the choice I would assume you thought through the ramifications and were willing to accept the consequences. Otherwise you would have chosen differently. Why then must we accept the consequences for you? It's your choice not ours.   GOD made us equal and in his vision.   Not quite, in one sense He did and in one sense He didn't. We know that due to the fact we are all different, some people are just smarter than others. He did however create us all in His Image, But that image has been shattered and distorted by sin. The fact that homosexuality doesn't show up till after the fall ought to tell us something. And don't tell me there was no fall because I see the effects of it every day and I battle against my own inner corruption daily.   Ephesians 2  By Grace Through Faith   And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.   But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.",1,2

""a and b above are the main elements to a marriage.""   The ""upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries"" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the  legal  sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate.  This debate is really about one question: Is homosexuality ok, or is it not? And if you leave religion out of the picture, as you should, the answer is inescapable: Yes, it's ok.",1,1
1064,"The problem is that basing the meaning of a word on its historical usage patterns leaves no room for evolution. When the legal definition of marriage was first established, it was, as you say, based on the views of society at the time.  But the views of society can change, and word meanings change along with them. And our laws should evolve to reflect these new meanings.  There was a time when black people didn't legally count as persons. Not too long ago you could've made the argument that the word ""man"" shouldn't include black men because generally when the word ""man"" was used, people thought of white men.  I still don't see what's so horrible about tweaking a legal definition.",1,1

Thus you have proven that having a legal definition be slightly different from society's definition is no big deal.",1,1
1066,"The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life. Allowing gays to marry doesn't affect you in any negative way.

It seems clear to me that the latter is worse.   ""my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren""   They can still do that. Allowing gays to marry doesn't impede straight marriage in any way.",1,1
1067,"Ok then, the difference is there's no good reason for expanding the definition of orange juice to include lemonade, but there are several good reasons for expanding the definition of marriage to include gay marriage -- reasons like fairness, liberty, and equality.  I don't see how expanding the definition of marriage is confusing at all. You can just tell your kids, ""Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children."" Do you seriously think they would have trouble grasping that?",1,1
1068,"""Gay people are currently free to do anything they want, so in terms of fairness, liberty and equality, gay people are not disadvantaged at all.""   This is so obvious I can't believe I actually have to state it explicitly: A gay person would want to marry someone of their own sex, whereas a straight person would want to marry someone of the opposite sex. Therefore, in terms of ability to marry  who they want , gays do not have the same rights as straight people.  Yes, civil unions would be better than nothing. But history has shown the idea of ""separate but equal"" is infeasible.",1,1
1069,"That's like saying buildings make bricks.   No, it's nothing like that. Actually, I see Avedomni over there has put it better than I can -- you're conflating description with definition.   Oh I see, you want to use the force of law to make me accept something I find unacceptable.   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to  tolerate  it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   early death (@45yrs of age) high rates of infectious diseases, depression and suicide is really a good thing   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just  is . Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude. That's a separate issue though.  Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.    I love those caught in the gay lifestyle and what to see them set free.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   http://www.apa.org/topics/ sorientation.html",1,1
1070,"To put it another way, marriages are what societies are made of just like bricks are what buildings are made of.   You could still have society without marriage. And even if that weren't true, expanding the legal definition of marriage to allow for gays would not be a radical change. More akin to changing the texture of the bricks.   doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.   Was enforcing racial integration tyranny? No. There are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not.   You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent.   No, I don't. But I think there are important similarities. Both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity. They cannot be changed. Neither makes a person inferior. Discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound.   Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone.   Again they are not the same, just similar. But saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading. It's like saying shouting is ""just a behavior"" and therefore people should repress their anger at all times. It's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality.   You wouldn't say it's a good thing?   I was referring to homosexuality, not gay marriage. Being gay is neither good nor bad, it's neutral. Gay marriage, on the other hand,  is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance.   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives.   Oh, wow, that's a pretty hardcore view. How is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder? All I see is two people having sex. No harm done.   Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good.   Agreed. But gay sex is not one of them.   Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Hahaha. You're a funny guy.   Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   Well, they  are  born gay and they  can't  change, so that's just telling them the truth. Why should their conscience be troubled? That would only make sense if they bought into all that Christian nonsense.   ...waving the magic wand of neutrality...   You wouldn't take seriously a pamphlet from Neo-Nazis about how Jews are inferior people would you? Do you not understand the importance of neutrality?   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.    Homosexuality is not a behavior, it's a sexual orientation. Gay sex is the behavior. We can and should repress bad behaviors, but gay sex is not a behavior bad enough to warrant repression.   you...deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul)   Morality does not come from anything supernatural.

How exactly did she falsely accuse the country of anything? She, along with anyone else who would want to, cannot marry someone of the sex due to the opinion of religion. I think that would qualify as religious oppression.   Oppression: unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power  A religion is unjustly exercising its authority by forcing everyone in the country to heed by it's teachings. Your church specifically I might add was primarily responsible for the passage of Proposition 8 due it's significant funding of an intolerant and fear-mongering campaign.   ""I don't plan on adding a reason because it's so obvious.""   I think this is your biggest problem.

""By saying that this country allows oppression. It does not. Yes it has in the past. But nothing to that degree is going on right now.""   Saying that this country allows oppression is a false accusation? You need to read over American history again. The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant. The degree of oppression is impossible to quantify and totally irrelevant. Any amount of oppression is completely and totally unacceptable. It is a fact that due to religious opinions in this country, same-sex marriage is illegal. While this may not be as severe as slavery, that does not take away from the fact that it is oppression caused by religion and therefore is religious oppression.   ""Intolerant? Fear mongering?

No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.   ""In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country.""   Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, ""Is America based on majority rules?"", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just ""get over it or move to another country."" Should the slaves have just gotten over it?

Here were some of the lies spread by the Proponents of Prop 8:   Prop 8 doesn't discriminate against homosexuals.  Prop 8 took away a right that gays already had. They were able to get married, and the passage of prop 8 took away that right. Regardless of whether not you agree with prop 8, it took away a right they already had and therefore is discrimination.   Children will be taught that same-sex marriage is ok  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you do not live in California. I cannot tell you how many ads I saw talking about how children would learn that homosexuality is alright. Regardless of how intolerant that is, it is a lie. Prop 8 mentioned nothing about education, and the California Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell assured everyone that Prop 8 did not even mention education and under California law, parents can remove their children from any health or family instruction they disagree with.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=Ys6jnC11Svs    There is no reason for them to be mentioning kids.  Oh by the way in watching that clip I found a lie. Well more of a half-truth. ""Both presidential candidates support traditional marriage.""

He took a lame wishy-washy stance, but he still opposed prop 8 and the video implied that he did not.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=aiX5APGCroU&feature;=related    A little under a minute and a half in: ""The rights of children are at risk. Children have the right to be raised by a mother and father.""   This has nothing do with kids. Nothing in proposition 8 affected education or adoption. It was all lies and propaganda.  Another gem in that video. ""We need to protect religious freedoms."" So how does forcing everyone else to abide by your religion protect religious freedom? That seems a bit bassackwards to me.

Furthermore what about single parents? Should they be allowed to have kids or adopt? My guess is you think so. They are not getting the influence of both a mom and dad, just like you think how same-sex couples raise kids, so what's the difference?  The bible should never be any justification for laws.

1133,Agreed. I personally think state governments should not be able to grant marriages and should only be able to grant civil unions to everyone. Marriages are too religious.

But I would hardly call it a time free of crime, pain, and suffering.  No one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks. There are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling.  A) Your friend doesn't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reason  B) Your friend lied to you  C) You lied to us.  Being homosexual is not a choice. Regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that, why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god? You guys really need to learn logic.  Marriage by the government is not a holy union. In a church it is. And that is what you guys fail to realize. No one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same-sex couples, you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you. However, according to the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, we cannot base our government off of religion. If we base marriage off of religion, how do we choose which one, maybe my religion says nobody can get married? Even if everyone in the country in Christian, which thankfully they aren't, we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy, it is not legal.  You can mince words all you want, but Christianity is a religion and atheism is not.  And proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. That's totally irrelevant, however, because it doesn't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional. You don't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you. Our system is not set up by majority rules. It is set up by majority rules with minority rights. The minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important.

1138,"Would you have said this in 1967 prior to Loving v. Virginia?  ""Interracial marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.  The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is itself an attack on the traditional meaning of the word ""marriage"". The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.  Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.  A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.  The new practice of what may be called a ""heteroracial union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.  In particular, the practice of calling this ""interracial marriage"" does harm both to the word ""interracial"", and to the word ""marriage"", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""interracial"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""miscegenation""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.  It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.  In conclusion, the phrase ""interracial marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word ""marriage"" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be ""heteroracial union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"". Finally, by unequivocating the meaning of the words used, much unnecessary disagreement and wasted debate could be avoided.""  There is a difference between harm and progress.",1,1
1139,"""As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented.""   First result on google: ""The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8."" I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.  And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.   ""What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority.""   You mean, just like interracial marriage? If you can't see the comparison, I'm really sorry.   ""Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!""   Yes because the LGBT movement trying to gain civil rights is exactly like the Nazi regime.  I don't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same-sex marriage.

""The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8.""   Same-sex marriage is not unprecedented.   ""Particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody""   Just like forcing the new definition of the word marriage as being interracial as well. How can you not see that this is exactly the same thing?   ""I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"".""   I never said words do not have meaning. And pondering meanings of words is not what I was criticizing you for. I was criticizing you for complaining that the natural progression of society and therefore its means of communication, language, amounts to a destruction of language.   ""Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used.""   No they were not all on your side. They never wrote anything about gay marriage or the changing of language of being its destruction. Wow you are really intellectually dishonest. They were authors who naturally were quite concerned with the meaning of the language they used to write their works, but that doesn't mean they were concerned with language changing. Please stop misrepresenting the truth.   ""Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.""   Here's a great example of your meaningless pseudo-intellectualism. ""Underlying reality"" is a meaningless phrase. Try to actually say something concrete next time. If you actually knew anything about language, you would understand what a joke it is to say that saying marriage is also between a man and a woman is a drastic change to language. Why don't you take a look at the archaic words and archaic definitions that are no longer used and then talk to me about drastic change. This change of the terms of marriage is incredibly slight. Yours is one of the worst arguments against gay marriage I have heard. At least Christians saying it goes against their holy book is factually correct, even though this is legally and philosophically incorrect. Merriam-Webster's definition of the word ""marriage"" includes same-sex marriage by the way.   ""This may sound academic, but it is not!""   At least you have one thing right.   ""This may seem outlandish to the  provintial  mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.""   I like when people deliberately use bigger words in a condescending way to sound smart and then spell them incorrectly. It tickles my irony bone.  And your argument if I can call it that about government censorship is lame. The fact that another government does something is not justification for it. I will spare you the holocaust analogies because I am still hoping you are intelligent enough to see now how stupid your point is.   ""The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.""
