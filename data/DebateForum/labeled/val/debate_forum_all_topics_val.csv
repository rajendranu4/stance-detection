"Yes, unfortunately that is democracy. The constitution gives us certain basic rights. If we want more we can pass laws to make more by majority vote or through our elected representatives. If those rights violate the constitutional ones, the courts can overturn them. If this happens the people can amend the constitution to pass the law anyway.  The constitution didn't give anyone the right to marry. People have passed laws allowing marriage between a man and a woman. These laws apply equally to all, so equal protection isn't violated (I'm sorry, you have just as much a right to marry a member of the opposite sex as anyone else). If you don't like it, you vote to change the laws.  That's democracy. It's not perfect, but it's the best thing out there!  Oh, and it's not the same as civil rights, and if I was black I would be horribly offended by such a comparison. They were fighting for basic human rights which had been denied them. They were being killed, and denied work opportunities and the right to vote. Homosexual's aren't being denied anything (that isn't already denied to everyone else in the country). They just aren't getting what they want.",0

This should not even need to be debated.  You cannot deny people equal civil rights while using their taxes to support the very government that is oppressing them.   Religions still have the option of blessing whatever unions they feel conform to their dogma.   What is so hard to understand about separation of church and state?

"After 720 days and countless of arguments (most of which I have not read) to the contrary, I still think like, yeah man ;)",1
"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",1

"Yes, but  why ? In your post on my ""Why is killing wrong?"" debate, you said killing is wrong because it damages the group and because it causes pain.

"Homosexuality or, gender disorientation is a mental condition. Weather it be environmental, or genetic, because someone feels as if a specific kind of behavior is ""natural"" does not make it so. I know I am going to get some blowback from people saying it was removed from the DSM and you are right, however the facts show that this was done under extreme political pressure and not because doctors dont believe that it is in fact a condition.   You would not help a schizophrenic individual by giving them two cups of tea, one for them and one for their imaginary friend, so why then would you support two men or women getting married? This is what I dont understand. Can homosexuality be treated, maybe. Can it be studied, not objectively as Homosexuals dont want to be fixed they want to be accepted which I completely understand. However, you can accept the behavior without condoning it and this is what America is saying. Yes, you are free to do what you want, but we do not recognize it as being healthy and no, we will not legitimize it by recognizing it through one of our most wildly held social traditions. I believe society as a whole has this right and its important that we do.   On a separate note, I dont think the state should have anything to do with making laws with regards to marriage or recognizing them, however I stand by my original premise that at least attempting to correct the behavior is better than condoning it.",0

I wasn't aware of the fact that Osama was found in Iraq...forgive me basing my conclusions on facts and logic, not bullshit like you.   If you can remember Republicans and democrats stood on the capitol with bush in and listened to the star spangled banner in agreement that war was absolutely necessary   Where the fuck do you get your facts?   6 House republicans voted against the war vote.  126 Democrats voted against the vote.   Do the poor create jobs? NO.   You are truly an idiot if you believe trickle-down economics has worked. Where the fuck are the jobs if it worked?!

But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion. Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive. Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born?,0
There are good people of good conscience on both sides of this argument. Isn't that a great indication that the government should butt out and let people make their own decision based on their own beliefs?  We on the pro-choice side are content to let anti-abortion people who are faced with unwanted pregnancy decide what they will do based on their own beliefs.   We think you should be free to live your lives according to your beliefs. We think we should too.,1
"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.",1

Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual.   All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire.   The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.  All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful.   The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:  1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)  2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)  3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)  I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together.",0

"The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime.. It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.. Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?! It is therefore your duty to have that baby because you chose to have sex ignorantly.. Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?! In the case where you were ""raped"", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever.. In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?! No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...",0

You kill a baby cuz you were raped and that baby is unwanted. I'm sure you don't reckon or enjoy it's birth. But, that gives no one a right to kill a baby.  I believe that abortions are a strict no until really required.  If the mom is incapable of the birth process or is too weak or may communicate a murderous disease or until your life is at the stake.  I'm glad that you are fighting for the right of the 99% of the unborn. I appreciate the fact that there a certain few who are involved. You fight for those who are killed for social reasons.

"I would just like to add one more thing. Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision. Why is that? What about the father? Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?  Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite. He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work. He should not have this right?",0

"Two rebuttals here i'd like to offer:  1) research about homosexual couples being better parents or that homosexuality is genetic. I'm sorry, but neither of these things are proven facts, and there is a lot of controversial research on both sides of the aisle. I think both sides should be able to agree here that neither side has been proven. I know, I know, you can show me 100 studies that say the above is true, but guess what, I can show you 100 studies that say the opposite and then we just get into the ""who's study is better"" thing, and it's just a waste of time. Many things can be conclusively proven. These are not yet in that category for either side. Besides, for all the ""studies show"" comments above, no one has cited a single one. I find the funniest thing about such studies is that everyone has heard of them and is sure something has been shown conclusively, but no one is quite sure when or where.  2) the adoption thing is really irrelevant I think. In this country there aren't hordes of orphans wishing for parents to adopt them. This is a myth taken from the situation some time ago. Walk into an adoption clinic, things have really changed. It's not easy to adopt. Now outside of this country things are very different I know, but I still don't think gay marriage is going to significantly impact this. Feel free to disagree with me here, I just really think this is a seperate topic. Oh, and if you disagree, I think you will see that studies show I'm right ;)  (I'm kidding in case you didn't catch that) :)",0
"Ok now, and read my whole argument and read it twice befroe you comment; gay, CHRISTIAN marriages should not be allowed.   By bringing this issue to the courts, the homosexual community is forcing a rule onto a private group! it is written in the christian rule set (of any form or branch of the following of Jehovah (Yes, that is His name), including Catholics, Jews, Mormans, ect.) that the bond of two souls of the same sex is unnatural, and as such is immoral. So here remains the issue; the Christians are upset because the homosexual community is FORCING, and not just by judicial means, their beliefs of unity onto another private party. It is written by the way in the most used from of the bible that it is an absolute sin to propose, follow threw, or allow a marriage of the same two sex's.   Keep in mind that i am not christian, but follow a similar religion that, while against the order of unnatural ethics, am for the furthering of the bondage of souls, and also believe that every soul finds it's way into each beast and its sex's.

"Legalizing pot alone would not end the war on drugs. It would help, but it would do very little to the biggest of our problems on the war, and that is, our organized crime. Our big time criminals, the Mafia's, none of this small time dealers we've got going on with pot (and when I say small time, I'm more referring to the type of criminal activity that goes on with in these drug organizations), my personal opinion would be the only way to completely end the war on drugs would be to legalize everything. This sounds absurd, I know, but think of the lives saved by doing this. Underground sex trades, the biggest Mafia's in the world, petty cold criminals- they're all run by drugs. In other words, its the law thats allowing these criminals to be what they are. If there were no law against drugs, if all drugs were run through a license, and sold legally, there would be a whole hell of a lot less murders, theft, prostitution, spreading of disease, deaths, and for most, it would shut down the worlds biggest criminal operations which thrive on selling illegal drugs. I'm aware this will never, ever happen... but it's worth a thought.",1
"Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as ""its my body its my choice"" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.   Selfishless is not illegal, nor should it be.  The fetus  is  making its home inside the mother's body, thus the choice of its continued residence there should not fall to anyone else but her. I am sure you enjoy being able to decide what medical procedures are performed or not performed on your body.   Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.    If abortion is immoral because the fetus is alive, and all things are equally alive, then abortion is the same as uprooting a weed.    There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves.   Foregoing an abortion does not cure the infertility of strangers.   If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.   There is no shortage of existing children who do not have homes. There is no reason to add to the number.  I am going to guess you have never seriously considered what it might be like to be  forced  to be pregnant based on what someone else thinks you are allowed to do with your body.   If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.   No, I wouldn't. If I was a fetus, I would be incapable of anger. If I was conscious, as I am now, I certainly wouldn't be happy, but I would never make another human function as a life support system for me.",1
"the truth of the principle is self evident. ? You mean that, in your opinion, the principle is false, right?

Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion... I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society. At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be ""banned"". This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it.

"Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary ""Should I smoke Pot?"" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a ""druggy"" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.",1

"I don't think we can attribute all of this growth to Obama.   Certainly not. But the record in undeniable. Under Obama, the economy grows.

""" Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal. ""  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)  And the website was about tobacco smoke. I knew that. But I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well.",0

I don't care how much anecdotal evidence you have, it has been proven to not be physically addictive. While cigarettes and alcohol are incredibly addictive, yet you seem to be okay with them.

"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree with you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed.   Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing.   Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation.   Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption.",1
"What a load of pseudo-intellectual crapola.  Marriage is just a word. It means whatever society decides it means. Currently it refers to a special kind of relationship between a man and a woman.

And they'll continue to do it in the future. You just need to get over it. Secondly, you can be both. You can believe in abortion under the right circumstances.    ""It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act... and abortion is the next.""   Could you be anymore heartless? The mother never  asked  to be victimized, so if she chooses abortion, it's more of an act she was  forced  into, not one she decided upon of her own volition. Why wouldn't you call the man who raped her a murderer, in essence? And let's consider for a moment the victim decided to keep her child - what do you think she may one day tell him/her when they continually ask where their father is? ""Honey, you were a mistake and your father brutally raped me in a dark alley somewhere?"" Yeah, kudos for Father of the Year!

yeah so people have the right to decide. certain things happen in life and some people may not be able to support a baby. if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child? i wouldn't. plus some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life. it's simply not our choice to decide what people want to do with their bodies and if they feel it is not killing someone then it is not on our plates it is on theirs.,1

This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal.

Liberals realize this is incredibly unfair and that income inequality is vicious, self-perpetuating cycle that needs to stop.    50% of Americans pay no taxes at all!   That is a lie. Stop being spoon fed republican bullshit lies and propaganda. They pay sales tax. Property tax. Estate tax. Social security/payroll taxes. Etc.   The wealthy pay their fair share   They do not.    Raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on EVERYONE.   When has obama EVER raised taxes?  He cut taxes for small businesses 16 times.  Extended the bush tax cut.  Fought against republicans to extend patrol tax cuts and won.  His jobs plan was over 50% tax cuts.  His stimulus cut taxes for 95% of americans.  He wants to cut corporate taxes from 35% to 28%.  The corporate tax actual rate (average percent paid...about 12%, not the 35% the right whines about) is the lowest in decades under Obama.  -  But no...he wants to raise taxes.

Because the people growing, trafficking, and selling marijuana have to take huge risks, they make the price higher. Once legalized the price would lower. So your argument that there would be a blackmarket with cheaper prices is invalid.  Really the last thing we need as a country is more people doing marijuana? I can think of far worse things. Assuming that legalizing it would significantly increase use long term, which you don't have evidence for, what is the big deal? People do not end up at rehab for marijuana. It is not addictive. If they go to rehab it is because they have addictive personalities and are using it too much because of that, not because it is addicting. People with addictive personalities can need help for anything. Out of curiosity would you have slapped Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they created apple while smoking marijuana.

"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :  In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution   I suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.  The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.  My response:  Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.  If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.  We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual?   The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:  The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.   Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.    If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.    I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.)   Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.  One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.",0

It makes it easier to see exactly what you're disputing. Thanks.   Newborns are not independent of their natural host   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.    Left alone they will die of thirst.   Well, so will anything. I don't see what relevance this poses.    a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult.   Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus. A fetus cannot survive independently until the third trimester, when abortion is illegal.    However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults)   See above.    You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.    A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.   See my first point.   f this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.   I do understand this. What I mean is, the way a human passes it's genes down is through sexual reproduction. A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.    I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed.   Firstly, I would like to say how little knowledge I have on this subject. So if I say anything stupid or offensive, it's nothing malicious, just ignorant.  OK, I'll accept that she is asexual. But she can't reproduce asexually, right? Meaning she has no reproductive capability. If she was able to reproduce, it would be sexually, not asexually? If so, my point still stands.   A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it)   I like that analogy. So I'll give my own spin.  A builder asks you if you want a new kitchen fitted for free. Obviously, you agree. You're very considerate and respectful to the builder, as he's doing it for free. You give him tea, coffee, breaks, all the perks he wants.A day later, you ask him how he's doing with the kitchen. He hands you the blueprints, and says, ""I'm working on it.""   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just ""working on it.""   Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.    Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her. The difference between an adult woman and a fetus, is that the woman is, without a doubt, entitled to human rights. The right to choose what she does with her body. The fact that the fetus' rights are in doubt, lets the woman take precedent.    Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?   The right to choose.    Nay. Again this is unfortunate, but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not? If this were acceptable, the retarded, disfigured, and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning.   I'll accept that one.

I said that ""you treat criticism as a joke"" and therefore, you are incapable of rational thought. If you can't even understand that and can't read, you are incapable of rational thought.   Didn't you say, according to your logic, that emotion cannot be used as a logical arguement?   And I have not exercised any emotion in my judgement of your rationality. Furthermore, I said that I didn't find it amusing. The lack of amusement is not an emotion.   I laugh because it is funny, not because it is irrational.   Here, you are confusing cause and effect.   No, it isn't a brute fact but it is a fact.   An unasserted claim.   Ok. I see that im a little wrong. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created.

"In short, yes. Compared to losing thousands of jobs, losing billions in personal and corporate tax revenue, and spending billions in welfare to support unemployed workers.   Considering that you are only looking at what is seen and not unseen. However, Ford maybe part of the unseen considering it didn't take a bailout, and it is still in business.  Losing of jobs would have been lost, but if an adjustable and corrective market, these people would have adapted.  As aforementioned, this $14 billion dollars is only estimates done by government, and government lie to fit thier agenda.   So, the real cost of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts demonstrate this.  A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has zero credibility. It pegged likely taxpayer losses in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts at $25 billion. For those with a sense of history, it is worth remembering that the S&L;bailout had a $160 billion price tag. The numbers diverge so far from reality as to be laugh-out-loud funny. Funny, that is, except that the CBO estimate demonstrates a willful disconnect with the actual consequences of federal government actions.  As demonstrated below, the real cost of the bailouts will easily exceed $1.3 trillion. In fact, the real cost is likely to range between $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and is not unlikely to reach $2.5 trillion.   Our only hope is to (1) accept up front a twenty-percent fall in American living standards for a people living beyond their means for the past twenty-five years on the delusions made possible by fiat money, and (2) simultaneously discipline the creature from Jekyll Island, a.k.a. the Federal Reserve System, not to create new money just to prop up asset-price bubbles. Mises    Ask Ford who didn't even take a bailout if it was worth it (in the story you linked to) to preserve the market and their supplier base, etc.   The CEO of Ford doesn't even understand that his own company one who didn't take the bailout is still in business because of good past decisions.   Then why wouldn't Bush claim the credit? and how was he releasing videos discussing current events?   None of which are actually links to any substantial evidence that he was still live.   and mandate coverage for the sick, increased access to preventative care, help prevent/detect fraud, stop rescissions of insurance when insurance companies find out your sick, etc.   Which is the reasons for double for less coverage, worse outcomes and medical bills that contributed to bankruptcies.   This plan is not a single payer government run plan like medicare - it sets the rules of the road and then lets companies compete   Actually, that is the eventual plan because in order to crowd out business, government first regulates it to death, then the whole economies of scale and natural monopoly come abroad, then government takes over.

Anything more is a waste of their time because they could be spending it doing something that they want to do. Sure, that's the American dream.

"I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like ""it will ruin your life"" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?",0
"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1

"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",1
"""We don't even abort animals like we do our own human children""  As a former veterinary technician, I can tell you that you're quite mistaken.

The pups/kits that are removed with the uterus are usually killed immediately by breaking their necks or by lethal injection. Horrific, yes it is. But beats the heck out of the alternative, having even more unwanted pets in the streets and shelters.   I don't like having to choose a side that says ""abortion is right"" because I don't think it is. But I do absolutely believe in the right of a woman to choose an abortion if she and her doctor believe it is the best choice for her. Sometimes an abortion is the lesser of two evils - and I don't think anyone but a woman and her doctor should be allowed to make that decision for her.",1

"IMO people have a right to receive treatment from whomever they choose, without restrictive legislature, or an invasion of privacy.  Since opinions like mine are a distinct minority, and I don't expect radical change any time soon, I am stuck arguing for the improvement of the quality or justness of laws that address issues beyond what I consider to be the proper domain of public legislature in the first place.  Take as an example marriage. I don't like paying taxes for judges to hear cases about marriage, child support etc..  I did NOT say that abortion is a gross irreverence for life. I said ""The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive.""  I believe that there ARE cases where the decision to perform an abortion is made with the best interests of the mother in mind, and with fair consideration of her situation, and what can be accomplished with the doctors current skills. I believe abortion should be something a woman is..to paraphrase Zombee...""faced with"", not something she seeks out.  On the other hand....

The boundaries between countries are fading, so what we need now is a great FOREIGN POLICY president and if Obama is good with one thing, it's with keeping debates, being respectful, and connecting with global leaders. The U.S. has never been in a more critical global part in our lives- we import 62% percent of our oil!- and we need the good will of other countries, especially Asian superpowers whether we like it or not. Obama already proved himself efficient in this case: it took him just two weeks to convince Egyptian dictator Hasni Mubarak to step out of office. It took a year for Clinton to do the same with another unstable leader!  We already know he's a good foreign policy leader; I think that in the next four years he'll have experience enough to be a truly great one... like President Truman. Besides the president can't really control the economy all that much (too complicated to explain now) so shouldn't we elect our leaders based on what they can do?",1

"The War on Drugs is not only a moral problem but a economic problem. First, it is morally wrong because the government restricts the free choice of individuals to participate in such substances, and the number of people people killed every year with selling or buying drugs is simply unnecessary and unjust. When someone engages in the use of drugs, it is the decision of that person and they are only hurting themselves nor the government.  Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well. The government would have 10 billion dollars to spend elsewhere. It would eliminate drug cartels. Not only is the enforcement costly, but by criminalizing these people, taxpayers have to pay for them in live in prisons throughout America.  The only negative aspect is that it may lead to a increase in drug addicts.",1

"Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.  Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.   Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.  views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.   Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.  An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this?   Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.  The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.  Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves.   Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy things  Ted Bundy: Serial killer  Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity.   I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me.   Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.   Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.   About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.   Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place.

"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.",1

"Yawn.  "" There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me — because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t — look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. (Applause.)  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.  The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.  So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the GI Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon.

"Gay people should get their own thing? I agree. In support, can anyone provide a very good reason as to why black people should have gotten their own kind of marriage? That is also what you liberals would call an ""arbitrary"" or ""capricious"" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should ""get their own thing"". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and ""new"" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G ""Great"" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts. Suckers! Shoulda hired better lawyers, you Mixers!  Oh wait, we're talking about those gay people. Yeah, suckers, you Civil Unioners. I won't call you by your real name, but you know what name I'm thinking for you when I think of you... you non-marriage Unioners!

"Historically marriage is a property arrangement wherein a man takes possession of a woman. This has led to forced marriages and polygamy being the norm for thousands of years up to this day in many parts of the world. What you call marriage is a western idea.

Considering womena's sufferge wasn't that long ago as far as history is concerned it's suprising that you think marriage has always been a equal union. No, actually it's naive.  On your point about blacks: They had to be allowed equal protection under the law before that could happen. Google: Jim Crow.  The racist were upholding the traditional norm that blacks were subhuman and shouldn't marry whites. You just don't seem to get it. People thought marriage didn't include them at the time either. You are looking at the whole thing backwards. The word is changed constantly through history and those against the change are always on the wrong side of it.",1

Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that just because a law is passed that people all of the sudden are going to change their mind and stop hating you?

Maybe I should get people organized and try to get me some of that action. What is it that I need.... a piece of paper? How do I go about it? Oh yeah, make the connection to civil rights (even though it really isn't the same thing at all. All I will be going after is benefits, not equal protection under the law, but what the heck).   Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, claim that denying me farm subsidies makes me a ""second-class citizen"" who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, farmers. This is good stuff ;)  So, the question is not ""should farm subsidies be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way towards non farmers. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".  This is easy! Why didn't I think of this before? ;)  But you know, it might be easier to just go after the benefits and maybe try to force the government to stop using the word marriage. That way you'll only have the government to deal with, not the government AND the religious right.   The gay community is fighting two fronts.

"In your hypothetical, the woman is not aware of the impending accident. If a person goes hiking, they aren't expecting of an accident to occur, or they would not have undertaken it in the first place.

Now you may think, ""Taking a hike in no man's land is also a decision that includes risk"" and you'd be right. But I believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion. I am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent (by deliberate decision or otherwise) they are responsible for the safety of that new human. Even to the extent of risking their own lives. That is my definition of assuming responsibility for the risks. That being said, I don't think there should be laws in place to  force  people to carry thorough a pregnancy, or donate blood to their injured child.

"So by your definition everyone is a bigot, including yourself, because I can probably come up with a group of people that you don't want to be around.  However, a closer look at the definition of the bigot will clearly show that it is possible for a person to not want to be around a group of people for reasons other than intolerance of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own. For example, I do not want to be around people that don't speak my language because I would rather be something else rather than trying to make myself be understood or trying to understand what they were saying.

Secondly, people do NOT choose to be gay, scientific evidence shows that people are born GAY, would you not allow a person with dyslexia or downs syndrome to marry? They are born different to us.

"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",0

"Good point on that maybe the United Nations should go into Pakistan and demand they disarm their nukes. It's pretty scary scenario when you think about it.   On the other hand I had a real new rule regulation hit me in the face to day. I was trying to surrender and pull my money out of a 403B plan that my wife has and before Jan 1 of this year it would have been no problem but now you can't. The reason when I asked my broker was they had no reason even when the regulators set out the new rules they targeted 403B and their reason according to my broker who is an expert on the markets said they had none. Great! So this is the great regulation we where all waiting for not allowing people to get their own money out. This just happened to me today. There's a lot more to the story but it is so frustrating that I will get even more mad. Basically the new regulation is a form of pure Socialism. My money, won't let me have it. I have to make up some lie just to get it out like I'm sick or something or I have a hardship which I don't but that's besides the point. I don't know if you own a home or business but if you did you would see the huge amount of more taxes you pay just to own a home or business it's stifling. The argument here is that the more taxes and more government regulation the less freedoms we have and less individual drive we have.

"I think marijuana should be legalized for various reasons.   First of all, let me make it clear that I currently do not consume marijuana. I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people. Like tobacco, it could be heavily taxed and provide more money for the Federal Reserve (I'm not sure that is a good thing).  So, there's my argument. Anyone beg to differ?",1

"It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.   That's called discrimination based on level of dependency. It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence. You protect the weak, not exploit or kill them.   It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call ""potential"" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a ""a clever rhetorical trick"" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day? I hope your kidding because of course it would. That's why we ban things, to stop them. And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.   your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.   Well, let's see. Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead. And that death came by willful intent, not an accident. In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide. But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK, right ? I don't think so.

"I don't believe gay marriage hurts anyone. The only people truly making it such a mad case is religious people. Sure, marriage is somewhat an act out of religion, but like others said, what is it if someone unreligious gets married? If people are going to make a big deal out of two people of the same sex getting married, then people of different religions, people of no religion, even people guilty of adultery shouldn't be allowed to marry either. Being against gay marriage really comes down to what people that follow the bible say the bible says. Which makes gay marriage against the bible, right? But then again, every single person on this planet is doing lots of stuff against the bible. So, really, what gives these religious people the right to say someone can't do something they disapprove of? Otherwise, I'd like to meet a non-religious person, or even a person acquainted with gay's, who is against gay marriage. (Just because it proves my case otherwise that it's all about religious bitching and it has not one thing to do with them personally). So, really, gay marriage is hurting those that let it hurt them for no rightful reason.",1

"Oftentimes it's one specific issue that causes some religious people to want to splinter off and make their own similar but different (on that one issue) religion. One needs only look at the many, many branches of Christianity to see that people have a lot of different opinions on proper Christian faith and behavior. I don't see why homosexuals shouldn't be able to do the same, and have rights that other splinter churches enjoy (there are LGBT Christian churches nearby that I know of, but they cant preform a legally binding gay marriage). We allow religious people to pick-and-choose the aspects of their faith that they want to follow and don't usually revoke privileges or rights for it. You can have just about every sin in the book on your hands and still be Christian, still have a Christian marriage, but these things don't always hold true if your sin is homosexuality. I get that homosexuality, like everything else, is an abominable sin in the Christian faith, but they don't allow or deny marriage rights based on how much you sin or what your sins are. If you're a gay Christian and you want to marry another gay Christian, why can't you have a Christian marriage?   I guess I've always seen the beliefs of the church and Christians as very mailable and ever-shifting; they alter their views so they can be accepted and supported by their host community. If the Church still opposed interracial marriage, for example, priests and Christians would be mocked and ridiculed for it. Yet at one time it was a valid and accepted position for them to hold. Allowing gay marriage is just the next grudgingly progressive step this backward religion is going to take; they're going to kick, scream, and really dig their heels in, no doubt, but Christianity has been fighting a losing battle since it was created, always giving ground to civil liberties at the last possible second, before they draw too much hatred upon themselves for their bigotry.",1

"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?   Yes, in the case that the lower-awareness individual cannot speak, or even comprehend their rights, for example. I suppose I should have added the qualifier that when the difference between awareness is so great that one of the individuals cannot even understand their situation, it seems reasonable to give custody of the body to the other who can.   If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.    It has all within its scope which care about foetal awareness. Some arguments are purely rights based, and see the mother as executive over her body.  With regards to AFS, I think the primary way it can be used without being seen as arbitrary is that if we find that a foetus isn't developed enough to be aware of its environment, then it isn't perceived as cruel to end its life because it isn't even aware of what it lost. I suppose this can be thought of as a stretch on the saying ""What he doesn't know won't hurt him."" This I believe is also a way to justify euthanasia (such as for deep-coma patients) because it is currently understood that they aren't even aware of their existence. So in other words under these contexts, an AFS isn't an argument for what the person will or may feel in the near future, but instead an argument used to justify a procedure as not being cruel to the recipient presently. Another strain of it arguably appears when we feel consoled when a person dies in their sleep, it is seen as less violent or cruel for that person to die while not aware of it.  An AFB would have the benefit of allowing human clones who are born without brains (beyond what is necessary for autonomic functions I suppose) to exist rationally to serve as organ hosts.  The UPA argument is the hardest to defend because as we both saw, it relies on a very grey boundary of what we feel is ""too soon"" or ""too late.""

Is that what you're trying to argue? Are you making the argument that marriages should be arranged in order to mutually benefit matriarchs and patriarchs? The only reason why marriages that were arranged tended to stay together was because the women weren't allowed to protest legally. They were second class citizens. Additionally, people were much more religious in times past and the Bible warned against divorce. How could one hope to go against the Bible?  ""If love is the criteria for marriage what do you do with all the arranged marriages that occurred throughout history, are they not marriages by your definition.""  Well, if morality is the criteria for goodness, what do you do with the crusades that were blessed by the pope (who's infallible, so be careful about contradicting him ;) )?",1

What if a women is raped and gets pregnant? so she just has to live with a messed up child?   This scenario does happen, however, it is much rarer that most believe, most abortions are from irresponsible sex but regardless it is still no reason to kill a human.   The fetus is not really sentient until it comes out   It is arguable that they are not conscious, however, just because they aren't does not mean they are not alive or do not matter.",0
"Sorry, doesn't work that way. You thinking something SHOULD be murder doesn't make it accurate to say it IS murder just because you want it to.

"If you will admit that abortion is EVER the best course of action in a given situation, the you will have to also admit that by definition, abortion is not murder. Now since the killing of an unborn fetus is  sometimes  legally designated as murder, we could discuss when it is appropriately termed ""abortion"" and when it is appropriately termed ""murder""  I can jump ahead and point out that in cases of ""medical necessity"" most people would agree that an abortion is not immoral.

I would suggest that we spend more time, effort, and resources looking after those humans we already have on board.

"Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.",1

"A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.",1

"""Homosexuality is not natural""  This is the most preposterous item I've heard in years. Are you ignorant to what is natural and not?!  Acceptance vs taboo   If you know anything about animal and human sexuality you would properly acknowledge that homosexuality has been around since the existence of sexuality. Animals display it on a daily routine. Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in ancient history, had many homosexual tendencies. (even on a more intense level of pedophilia)   As an evolving society, homosexuality was bound to get to the point it has today. Let me also add that if you knew anything about the adoption procedure and the psychological harm that those who go through adoption have to deal with, it would pale to comparison to the teasing they would go through in their schooling.  My point is that on items of sexuality it is not all monkey see monkey do.   I have so many points and so little time. I'm very happy to see the down votes. (means I'm getting to you people!)   As for your opinion, I'm not here to change it. I'm just here to point out all the fallacies in your argument.",1
Ever think that it is because your mother had 2 abortions before you that you are doing well now? It is just as hypothetical to assume that those 2 abortions were just little yous that got denied a chance as it is to assume that those 2 abortions occurred at a time when your mother wasn't ready and when she was ready she did have you and you are being successful.  Hopefully people here aren't against adoption - it is one of the few options for mothers who can and do go through with a pregnancy even when the mother and or father cannot support the child.  One other thing to mention - while you may feel strongly that one choice is better than the other - making something legal or illegal should meet a different test; for example - if a woman is 5 months pregnant and finds out she needs chemotherapy - should the government force her to not get the treatment and risk killing herself and the child all at once? Government cannot imagine every potential abortion scenario and in a free country is not the one that should make those decisions.  Keep up the good work.,1

"Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident.   It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally. You continually present the child as an accident. This means you have a knowledge of biology equivalent to that of a 4th grader in middle America. Or. You are knowingly stating lies to further an unfounded point out of lack of an actual argument. The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring. By making it a pleasure activity, you corrupt its true purpose. Now this is fine as long as one is prepared for that stupid, implausible. far-fetched, unlikely, ludicrous scenario where... what is actually supposed to happen happens. Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   And none of which are usually fatal.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases. I am on the side of life. If death is the result in either case, why put the parents through unneeded trauma? And my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape, thus, it is my only other exception.   That was not my point.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.",0
"Hmmmm.   I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.  God give me the strength to change the things I can,  the patience to put it with the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference.",1

"OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?  I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.  Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.  I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.  What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy.   So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context.   But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.  So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons.   So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.",0
"Wow so much ignorance and hypocrisy to address.   ""I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera""  Please observe the middle ages. That is probably an ideal time for Christians. Gays were killed. No science. Blasphemers were killed. Almost everyone was Christian. But I would hardly call it a time free of crime, pain, and suffering.  No one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks. There are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling.  A) Your friend doesn't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reason  B) Your friend lied to you  C) You lied to us.  Being homosexual is not a choice. Regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that, why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god? You guys really need to learn logic.  Marriage by the government is not a holy union. In a church it is. And that is what you guys fail to realize. No one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same-sex couples, you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you. However, according to the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, we cannot base our government off of religion. If we base marriage off of religion, how do we choose which one, maybe my religion says nobody can get married? Even if everyone in the country in Christian, which thankfully they aren't, we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy, it is not legal.  You can mince words all you want, but Christianity is a religion and atheism is not.  And proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. That's totally irrelevant, however, because it doesn't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional. You don't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you. Our system is not set up by majority rules. It is set up by majority rules with minority rights. The minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important. The framers of the constitution specifically set up the government to avoid the kind of religious and tyrannical persecution they experienced in England.",1

"""But the American public has come to understand the bad that can come of these drugs.""   Annual deaths in the US from tobacco: 435,000  Annual deaths in the US from alcohol: 85,000  Total recorded deaths due to marijuana: 0  I'm not so sure people understand the harm that comes from them.  I don't see how you can support prohibition of marijuana, but not alcohol and tobacco without realizing what a hypocrite you are. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse no matter what metric you use.   ""Just because pot may not be physically addicting, does not mean it is not mentally addicting, which is just as bad. It means your brain is hooked and can't function without it. ""   No you can still function without it, you are thinking about the addiction that comes from cigarettes which you support. Marijuana can be psychologically addictive. All that means is that if you really like the feeling of being high, you will want to do it again. This does not mean you are not able to not do it. Anything that you enjoy can be psychologically addictive (Sex, gambling, createdebate.com). Even if marijuana were addictive like cigarettes and alcohol, you cannot use this point to argue against legalization unless you support prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. As I said name something bad that it doesn't have in common with those two drugs.   ""They tend to forget that marijuana smoke is 6 times worse than cigarette smoke, when it comes to carbon monoxide and the toxicity of the smoke itself.""   You have one misleading and one incorrect fact there. Marijuana smoke has been shown to not cause cancer. Scientists hypothesized that it would cause cancer because it contains more harmful chemicals, but when they did actual studies on live animals, they found absolutely no link between marijuana and any form of cancer. This is just one study by UCLA I can get more if you desire them.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html   So while it may be true that it contains more harmful chemicals, for whatever reason it still doesn't cause cancer.   In reference to the toxicity of the smoke, you couldn't be more wrong. Scientists have not been able to induce death in an animal due to marijuana. It's LD50, or quantity that would be lethal to half the population, is so high, that we cannot even find it. It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana and consequently there has never been a recorded death due to it.   http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm   I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you say smoke causes ""little nicks"" in arteries. Please cite an article or study because what you are saying makes no sense.  The study you cited by the British Lung Foundation doesn't appear to have been published in a peer reviewed medical journal like the studies that show marijuana is not harmful. Here is why the study is misleading.  They start out with a very bold statement  ""Smoking pure cannabis is more harmful to lungs than tobacco, a health charity is warning.""  So you continue on reading to see how exactly they proved that.  First ""evidence"":  ""A study by the British Lung Foundation found that just three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes. ""  First of all it is very uncommon to smoke three joints a day. Secondly they were most likely comparing unfiltered joints and filtered joints which is really intellectually dishonest. They also don't talk about what type of damage they are referring to. Marijuana smoke does temporarily paralyze the cilia or small hairs in your air passageways which can temporarily increase the risk of colds and other upper respiratory tract infections(OH NO). The smoke does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Furthermore there are other ways to ingest marijuana, including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals, vaporizing which releases only the THC and no harmful chemicals, and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals.  Second ""evidence"":  ""Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco. ""  As I said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say. While it may contain more carcinogens, it doesn't cause cancer. Numerous studies have failed to find any link. Yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer. Think about it, if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke, or even bad all, why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer, but so many showing tobacco causes cancer. There is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone.   http://www.salem-news.com/articles/ january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                           As I said, they don't have any concrete evidence that it causes health problems. It is not enough to say it contains dangerous chemicals. Especially when numerous studies show the chemicals don't cause damage.  You still somehow manage to fail to name one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes with evidence. Every thing you named once again is present in alcohol or tobacco and most of them weren't true.  So once again I ask you to name a negative result of marijuana that isn't present in tobacco or alcohol. And don't give me, 'it's too late to make alcohol and tobacco illegal.' First of all it is never too late, that is a cop out. But regardless of the pragmatism of making them illegal, I'll bet you still don't think we should.",1
"First of all, making blanket statements about an entire group of people (that includes our President) makes YOU an idiot. Secondly, if it were completely legal, priced and taxed similar to tobacco (which is HEAVILY taxed), it would be a drop in the bucket. I would love to pay for pot what tobacco smokers pay for tobacco.  Currently, obviously, cannabis is illegal. Currently, also, cannabis is a gateway drug because the same people that end up handling it, handle other hard core drugs. If it were legal, those people would have no desire to traffic marijuana because there would be no underground market (like there is no underground market for tobacco and alcohol). Therefore, marijuana would no longer be a gateway drug.  Making the argument that marijuana legalization would lead to Meth legalization, and THATS why we shouldn't legalize is pretty poor. Especially considering you have no references or evidence.",1

"You sated:  ""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.   If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""  My response:  Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another.   You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.  Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.  Again, you stated:   'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'  Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:  Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.  Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.  Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.  Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.  Reductio ad absurdum!  Again, you stated:  'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. '  What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.  Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities.   You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”  Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.  And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best.   The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers.",0

As for adopting it out, why would a woman put her self through all the changes and pressure of being pregnant, then not keep the child especially if she knows she is in no way shape or form ready to go through the while experience? However, If that was the main purpose for a woman to get pregnant in the first place, that's a totally different story.   How is it murder? It doesn't even truly exist yet.

"I will argue first from a practical position, then philosophical, then historical.  Marijuana is not dangerous. There has been a death recorded due to marijuana. The LD50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high. Far higher. You can reasonably say it is so high, it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana. Also marijuana does not make you stupid. The reason people think this, is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen. When you die from a lack of oxygen, your brain cells die. The severe errors in the study, however, were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid. They have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke. A UCLA study found no link. The gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana. Because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers, they are exposed to harder, dangerous drugs. If marijuana was able to be sold in stores, this would not happen. Legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children. According to many studies, it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol. This is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for IDs. However, because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot. The legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy. We spend billions of dollars each year to keep people in prison because they like to get high and relax. Additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation. It is the number one cash crop in California for example. ~60% of the money of Mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the US. Severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the United States as well as Mexico, which would help improve Mexico's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the United States.  The government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else. It is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner, but I guarantee that it's much better for both you and society that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner. Here's a more reasonable example: Should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend? This is much more harmful than marijuana, and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death. The bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism. Where do you draw the line? Do we monitor people's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure people are productive and that they get promoted? Do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you? Do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because people have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana? The answer is no. Adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves. We do not live in a ""nanny-state"" as Ron Paul puts it.  Many people assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it. This simply isn't true. The first marijuana laws in the United States forced people to grow marijuana during colonial times. Marijuana became illegal for a few reasons. One was due to extreme anti-Latino and anti-black sentiment. People were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white society especially due to marijuana. The ""reefer madness"" campaign created undue hysteria. Yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role. In fact President Nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal.  http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/ Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm    The next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal. Again there are a few reasons. What kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism. By this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana, that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal, they will most likely cite things that simply aren't true. Additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge. Companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal. They don't want competition. Why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive? Many people underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy. The alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti-drug and anti-marijuana advertisements and programs. The goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs, its to stop you from doing drugs that they don't sell you. Also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the United States. Just like the tobacco and alcohol companies, pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress. Marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health. It combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions, and has no side effects. Compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs. It has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects. Thousands of people die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs.  As I hope you can see, the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels. Making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids, keep people away from dangerous hard drugs, and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives.",1

A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",1
"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage. We set high standards for our children's education and hold them to it. Why not set high standards for them sexually also, since nothing curtails an education like a pregnancy. Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.  There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.",0
"My argument is very simple.   By having sex, one acknowledges the possible repercussions of that act. Primarily being 1) being impregnated and 2) getting an STD.   By having sex, one realizes it might end up Ina pregnancy. No form of protection is 100% effective. So anyone having sex should be able to have the responsibility of having a child.   Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus? It is life. It is human life from a few hours after conception when the gander has become a zygote with the DNA addition of the father. The killing of human life is not a fair outcome for someone not at fault for anything.",0

"""Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.""  First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion. Instead, what I did was set out generic examples on why abortion should be acceptable and unacceptable. If we were to debate about specific cases, there would be no end to possibilities that we could conjure. And secondly, I never wrote that 'killings were okay', I used the word acceptable throughout my point, and that brings a different weightage and seriousness to the issue. Not just one where, it is ""okay"" or ""not okay"" as if we were picking vegetables at a supermarket.  ""Abortion is a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'? ""  I never implied that abortion is a painless process, it is a very physically and emotionally painful process that may scar one for life. But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'. Instead, they should face up to what they have did and actually consider about raising the life that they created and not kill it simply because they just wanted the pleasure of sex at the point and nothing else. Of course I'm generalizing here by saying that teenagers are irresponsible people, but truth be told, many teenagers choose abortion as the easy way out, when actually they might be able to raise a child with the support of their families. How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned? Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners? If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.   ""It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.  Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.""  I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance. And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place would she? Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.",0

If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.  ""Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?""  African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not.

I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them).

"Dear opponent, let me ask YOU a question.. do you even know how to debate?!  In a PROFESSIONAL debate, you do not attack any opponent but attack the argument.. I suggest you concentrate on attacking the argument instead of attacking the opponent next time..    Don't change the topic.   First of all, i do not follow any religious groups and personally i think that that information about condoms is just ridiculous and built on ignorant opinions..   You identify as Muslim, which is a religious group, and Muslim religious authorities have spread misinformation about scientific issues. The Catholics however are the primary offenders when it comes to issues of birth control misinformation.   Secondly, if i were to follow your ""style"" of debating, I'd say: You are acting irrationally and a person with no beliefs or morals.   Whether or not I have morals or beliefs is not the topic of this debate. You should be more concerned with my statement about imposing your morals and beliefs upon others.   Third of all, exactly as you said, these are my beliefs and morals and as i said only God decides the fate of all mankind, so i am simply sharing my point of view and debating. I am not forcing anything on anyone and every person is free to follow what they believe...   It is often best to not base a position on beliefs but instead form a position from data and evidence, that way you can form an unbiased solution for dealing with the problem at hand. If you take a random handful of people, and ask them how they feel about abortion, they'll give you widely varying starting times for when it is killing an innocent life, ranging from conception to birth. However there is only one true answer, and this is why science is important here.   Yes i am. In the case where a woman practices unsafe sex and does not want a pregnancy to occur, there are certain pharmaceutical drugs that should be taken between 48 - 72 hours after intercourse.. Otherwise, expect anything..   Fertilisation begins 3 weeks after intercourse. About 50% of abortions occur before the zygote becomes an actual foetus, and about 40% occur before the foetus has a developed heart.   Is she really? As i mentioned in an earlier argument, by keeping quiet she is the one allowing herself to go through all this pain.. She may be scared but if she thought of the consequences of keeping quiet - which is a pregnancy maybe - then she should realize keeping quiet isn't the wisest thing to do.. You speak up, you get help and there would be no reason for abortion anyway...   Yes. Getting an abortion is a form of personal responsibility.  Do you have trouble understanding rape? If a woman is raped, the social stigma of being pregnant is less important than the persistent reminder that your child is unwanted, forced upon you by a violent sexual act, and the offspring of the man who did this to you.  This is why using god as a basis of ethics and morality can lead to some very unrealistic solutions to simple problems.",1

"First of all, you further the previous point made about disinformation in how the quote you posted uses 'she' instead of 'they', attempting to personify the foetus further than it should be.   The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive   Every single part of your body can be considered alive, except your nails and hair and a few others, I believe. Cutting off a piece of skin holds no moral issues for you, I would guess, it's a similar idea. Except a foetus will cost thousands of pounds/dollars/euros, will take thousands of hours of time, will restrict you throughout your entire life, cause you to be labelled because of it, and cause you to endure a huge amount of hardship from it. There are reasons for abortion as well, studies have shown that about three quarters of women choose them because of financial reasons, hardly their choice.   Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it   I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.   Actually, humans kill thousands of life forms every single second, just because it's seen as morally wrong there is a big issue with abortion. Why should it be morally wrong? Please give me a reason why it is so intrinsically bad to take a life with no emotion?  I would suggest that Pro-Lifer's are not necessarily blind to truth, they see it, they simply ignore the truth of what happens to those who are not allowed abortions. Abortion rates does not change massively when it is outlawed, all that happens is they do it illegally and unsafely. Further, the argument made by Republican candidates is that abortion should be outlawed to protect the 'nuclear family'. Hardly relevant, as typical, married, happy, nuclear families would not get abortions a significant amount of the time. Give me a convincing argument as to why abortion is so bad.",1

"Please somebody own me on this....  My answer is going to be lengthy  I have a few problems with the question.   First of all the question is untimely. We don't know who his competitors will be( even if we think we can guess)   Second of all, consequently we have no idea what the competitors ideas or arguments will be.   The answer is neither Yes nor No, it's ""I don't know"". We have to wait till the evidence is in.   There is a problem with this as well. The problem is that most political reforms don't have impact till years after they have been approved. This makes it hard to evaluate certain decisions; while lending reinforcement to the saying ""Hindsight is 20/20.   But evolution has blessed us with the gift of playing out scenarios in our heads before they actually happen.   Before I get off topic let's look at some logical facts. Money and value are imaginary ideas that we give to certain attributes of life. Of course one is the physical manifestation of the other. Money is supposed to equal value. How do we determine value? There are three main reasons that I can think of.     1. Rareness (as in gold or diamonds) These are just elements arranged in certain patterns that we give value to mostly for aesthetic appeal. They are both useful in other ways, but this is not normally valued over aesthetic appeal, thus diamonds cost fucking a lot.  2. The next is effort. Money is meant to be a measure of effort that can be traded amongst others for their effort. I think this is a good thing, but at the same time it makes me sad. Large hunks of metal decorate college campuses all over as sculptures that could have been put to use as cars or something else, yet they are valued more for they're aesthetic appeal (see example 1.). Despite this waste,(and many others) money is a good system. It measures our irrational and rational feelings towards certain things, and we can exchange our effort for what we value with a neutral measurement of currency.     3. Originality. This may be a new invention or a new idea that we have our evolution given foresight to value. It is also in a sense rare like example one. It may also require a great deal of effort like example two. Thus originality is valuable.   (a quick side note: don't confuse this with harmful original ideas like cannibalism or religion. They are both original but neither is truly helpful, if not completely detrimental.)   What am I getting at?   MONEY and SUSTAINABILITY!  That supposed measure of effort that we have to trade for the things we want. The more we print the less it's worth. (the less rare, the less valuable; i.e. if gold was everywhere we would have no value for it...after all it's everywhere)   Actually then maybe it would be valued for what it's actually good for...   The point is that, if we have a standard for the measure of effort to pay for the things we want, and need; this standard cannot be allowed to change. What good is a standard for measurement if it can be changed at inconsistent intervals? This leaves no measure.   If Obama is willing to stop changing the standard of effort, i.e. stop printing money. Then yes I would be willing to give him a second term, however this seems unlikely.   He seems to want to use a scalpel because he doesn't have the balls to use an axe when needed. He can print more money and the standard will change in amounts of numbers, but THE EFFORT DOES NOT CHANGE! The effort will remain the same or most likely grow stronger regardless, if not because of, the variable change in the measure of effort. i.e. speculation in the trading of currency (measure of effort) on the stock market. As well as deep questioning about the worth of everything. When a standard changes, all that were measured by that standard must be re-evaluated.   Once again I say the answer to the question is a matter of how he handles the standard of money and how sustainable it stays as a measure of effort; but I remain skeptical...  I will elaborate further if I even get a reply to this argument.",0
"Abortion is right because the moral values that ""pro life"" advocates usually hold is that of religious sediments, most of the time disregarding whether or not abortion is helpful to society. Abortion prevents unwanted children, and or growth in areas where we most certainly wouldn't want it. Abortion increases happy family rates, and higher average level of education among families. A fetus is, for all intents and purposes, part of the women until removed from the women, and before any pro lifers try to mince those words I'll go outright and say yes it does mean I support the abortion of a child no matter the stage of development, an unwanted baby that couldn't be dealt with for whatever reason at one point weeks is no different from a unwanted baby at another. Ignorant religious people argue that such barbaric elimination of human life is evil, but I find it odd that they would object to something that would result in the immediate entry to heaven(by my knowledge Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe babies who die go straight to heaven). Why subject them to the hardships of life when they aren't wanted? I also agree with the fact that mothers should have the only say in whether or not she has an abortion( I also believe however that a man who wants an abortion but gets denied should have the right to be exempt from child support) My ideas on the subject go into extremes far beyond normal pro choice standards, but I honestly feel satisfaction in knowing I support something that is beneficial to society. And before anyone questions the lack of ""morals"" behind my believes just know that in our modern world, ""morality"" has no meaning, just different perceptions developed from our understanding of religion. Without religion there would be no such thing as ""evil"". I prefer to live in a world driven by logic, and to that point abortion is a logical way to better structure the family units in the world today.",1

"I can't admit that of course because I am pro-life. Even in the case of incest and rape...the child is also the victim and has the right to life even though the mother had an act of violence thrust upon her. Abortion is also a violent and cruel act. We dont even abort animals like we do our own human children.   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   Or do you just think all cases of abortion are ok?  What do you mean medical necessity? Do you mean the less than 1% of the cases when abortion is perform to save the mothers life? In most cases both can be saved.   If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery? It is the most common surgery performed in America today. Do you ever hear a woman say....gee I cant have lunch with you cause I have to have an abortion that day. OR hear a discussion about abortion at the Thanksgiving table?

"What does it mean to have gay marriages legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.",0

"Nobody has the right to another person's body. A woman has the right, for lack of a better term, evict. It is her body, she does not have to gestate for 9 months if she doesn't want to. Arguments about having sex mean you accept pregnancy are ludicrous.  Look at it this way. We don't require parents to give up their organs, or their blood, or their extra kidney, or even their bone marrow in order to save the life of their 1 year old child. If that child needed a transplant or it dies, we do not force the parents to donate. even something like Bone marrow, that will not kill them. We don't force anyone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want to.  So why would we force a woman to keep the fetus alive. It uses her kidneys, blood, lungs, etc. Pregnancy can cause health problems and complications worse than being a bone marrow donor, or even a kidney donor. Why would the law force a woman to go through pregnancy until the fetus is born, but not require the parents to keep the born child alive? Why does the fetus get special protection that a child does not?   The woman needs to choose to gestate for 9 months, and accept the risks that go with it at every stage. She has the right to change her mind if the risks become to great, or even her awareness of the risks become too great. When she becomes pregnant, she should have the right to research and evaluate the risks of carrying to term consult with her doctor and accept or reject those risks.",1
"Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life.   For it has nothing to be innocent of, it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus.   A fetus is a parasite, living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed. Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life.",1

Laws do indeed parade themselves as philosophical and moral beacons though, common law is a perfect example. Previous court cases and the reasoning behind them can have significant impact on a case. Also the common criticism of a action as immoral is that it is illegal.

"“For You created my inmost being;You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child … And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth?   During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?    Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.” In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.   Many pro-choice posters say “My Body. My Right.” Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Lord knew you, even before conception!    Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says “If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.”   But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound.   Luke 1:42-44 says “In a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.” When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said “Both Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ‘unplanned’ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is.",0
"I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   With conjoined twins, the ownership of the body can be disputed. They share bones and organs; it is not a clear-cut case of one separate but dependent organism residing in another. I know there is physiological variation with conjoined twins, but take Abigail and Brittany Hensel as an example:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel    How can one sister make a claim to the shared organs at the expense of the other sister? They own them equally. I don't believe a fetus can be said to own any part of the mother's body  at all , much as less as much as the mother does.  Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved. Except, in the case of abortion, the benefiting party is not a person yet.",1

Hence, they're not a human construct.   I, then, must agree with Hobbes.   Yes.   I bought Leviathon awhile ago. Now I wish to read it. Tell me, in what writing came the debate betwixt Rousseau and Hobbes?   Both. Overbearing monarchs infringed on human rights.    Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest. Granting them this right does not infringe on the rights of others and is not a threat to public safety.   Homosexuality leads to diseases, as do other sexual perversions.",0

"That scenario of the endangered mother is rare. The vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children. You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.  The right to life is  the  most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue. When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.  In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion. And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust. I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.  In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.  This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere. This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I. Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.      Just consider that 1/3 of our population has been exterminated since Roe vs Wade. Do you think that has an affect on Social Security now that there are more people drawing from it than paying into it. What of the effects on health care?

"OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.  ""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""   http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/ bornorbred.pdf   a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  ""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  ""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""  I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)",0

Normally, I am against killing, but a fetus is a lot different than a fully grown human, or even a child.

"If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault!   What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex. They KNEW no protection or form of contraception is 10% effective. If it fails, don't blame the contraceptive. They knew there was a chance that it could fail. Yet, knowing this AND knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work, they still had sex. They put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing.    That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   That is an awful analogy. A better analogy would be if the Haitians had placed thousands of tons of high explosives on the fault line and blew them up and were surprised there was an earthquake.   I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition. Yes, there are scientific definitions, but that is irrelevant because you chose to ignore them in favor of an inappropriate one.    Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged?   Nope. That is a lie.

Abortion is invariably the decision of the woman because it is her body whether if the sex was consensual or rape. The government nor the Church has any right telling what a woman should do with her body. Abortion is acceptable because a fetus is not a baby.,1
it is imoral because it kills a person and every man is created equal also if the mother is a person who would actually be so irresponible as to have unprotected sex when she doesnt want a child then she should have to bear that punishment and should be able to eventually give her child up to adoption,0
I personally dont agree with the gay marriage situation but i do believe that this is a free country and they have as much of a right to get married as any straight couple. They can love each other just as much as a straight couple. Everyone has a right to their own opinion and beliefs.

"""if you were a baby, were going to be born and were aborted, you probably would care"" this statement is all about ""if"". In reality, the fetus has no mental capacity to care about anything.

You are a murderer if you believe in that!!! A woman who has a baby in her stomach does not have the right to kill it before it is born because it is her own dang fault!

"That's not really accurate, no. Your body doesn't fight against the production of a male featus.

"Half of the ""facts"" I see here are either untrue or not even directly associated with anything Obama has done. The economy hasn't recovered. The sharp decrease in unemployment was due to the number of people who stopped getting unemployment benefits after looking for employment for years. Note: you are only counted as unemployed if you are still actively looking for a job. How did he single-handedly save the U.S. auto industry? The deaths of the 22 Al Queda Heads were the cause of the hard-working men and women in the military. Not sure how he's even indirectly responsible for that. How has he improved relations with other countries? Afghanistan still hates us (probably because we're invading them, but no one wants to talk about that war), Iraq hates us more than ever since we left, as soon as we got out of Iraq, Iran decides to start talking about a possible conflict with the U.S, and Israel is starting to hate us as a direct result from Obama's foreign policy on Israel. He isn't a small spender. Fact: he has spent more money in 3 years than any other president has in 8 (that counts inflation). And just to top it off, he's spent more money on vacations than any other president. I do believe his last Hawaiin vacation costs $4 million, 99.7% of it being taxpayer dollars. Do your research man.

"If you were not taught how to put a condom on, in any years of high schooling, then one of your teachers are applicable to be the victim of a law-suit. If you performed sexual activity with your spouse and got her pregnant, you could make allot of money from one of teachers.   Learning how to put a condom is the entire essence of reducing teen pregnancy and STD's. If safe-sex is performed by teenagers, then it is a non-contributing factor to pregnancy.    "" But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex; they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.""   Well... yes, it does help. You make the basis of this argument with the fact that teenagers are still engrossed in having sex, but what you fail to realize is that education has taught them how to enact safe-sexual procedures decreasing there chance of becoming pregnant. No one argues about teen sexual activity as it is irrelevant if they are doing under the influence of protection.    ""they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate.""   How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate. Especially when this is all under the influence of safe-sex, you have no basis to say that sex is wrong outside these variables of yours.    ""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""   Funny that, it sounds as if you read all of it and didn't have anything easy to rebut so you ignored it in your next dispute. Also if you read it properly without such a bias opinion you would be less inclined to be falsely prophesizing your point of view in a spurious fashion. Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that""  -""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  -""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays” ROFL WTF?!  And now,  -""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""",1
"People shouldn't be having sex? Doesn't that mean they'll be preventing babies from being born = preventing conception in the first place?

Here's where I draw the line: Before the fetus can digest milk via its digestive tract, it is entirely the mother's decision whether it should be aborted or not. It is PHYSICALLY a part of her and is not yet capable of survival without direct connection to her (via the umbilical cord) and so it is her decision and should not be made illegal.",1

"Abortion isn't killing babies like most people think. A fetus in the early stages of development is really just a soup of cells lumped together in one spot. It doesn't have the ability to think or feel pain as it doesn't have a brain yet.   Sometimes abortion would be the best option for the mother. If a woman had been raped and got pregnant as a result of that, she has all the right to abort if she wants to. If a woman doesn't have the economic resources to support the child, abortion is also an option. Sure, some people say adoption but a lot of kids spend their whole lives in a shelter because nobody adopted them. Can you imagine how much mental pain they go through? How much they've suffered? If this situation is bound to happen, the best option would be to abort the unborn fetus before it has the capability of suffering.",1

Because you offered your scathing critique of Silaswash's writing style and left your response absent of anything that would give a clue as to your perspective regarding the subject being discussed.   You have claimed that abortion is an ""unnecessary"" surgery.   I didn't claim they all were.   You have also claimed that parents treat the life of their developing child like trash.   Well they are certainly not given a burial   Both of these claims are unasserted.   ~laughs~ I'll try to start making claims that  are  asserted, Mr. Intelligible.",1
"First, you are making a hasty generalization.   second, your making an anecdotal argument.   3rd; If gays could marry and were accepted, your father wouldn't of used your mother to hide and try to deny who he was, further more there may of been less social stigma and he might of stuck around.   4th. Marriage, in this sense, is strictly a governmental institution; NO one, or at least very few, is even hinted that churches should be forced to marry anyone. There are legitimate legal rights and privileges granted to married couples by government, and there is no secular reason to deny them these rights based on their sexuality. Marriage is not only a religious or cultural thing, but a governmental one.",1
"No, i don't treat your criticism as a joke. I never did. And thus, you are judging me wrong.   So why did you add ""lol"" in front of an already illogical comment?   Wasn't you that said that emotion can't be used as a logical argument? It was you.   I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   ""Ok. I see that im a little wron. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created.""   In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   I implied normal as the ""carrying capacity.""   Which is a completely fallacious implication. The term ""carrying capacity"" does  not  imply ""normal"" at all. It is a technical term in Geography which refers to ""the idea that any given environment can only support a finite population.""   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one.   This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable   It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   No, I didn't. The only reason why you say so is because you an obstinate fool.   But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong.   Which is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   You  are  wrong. Something cannot be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.   Hey idiot, you  did  mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.",1
"Wow, you are a chore.  I am calling you closed minded. You have to be willing to attempt to see the issue from the other person's point of view. I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin."" I'm a really good person, in fact. So to me, it feels like people want LGBT people to be all sinning and rebels and haters. No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads. The sinners are those hot Catholic school girls who take their shirts off for girls gone wild the second they get out of the house. In fact, that is what's wrong with the white picket fence scenario. It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.  By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State.",1

"Well I'm sorry (not literally) that you feel so categorical towards the development of human life. Some of us, who actually believe in a reproduction with effort, look at a fetus AS HUMAN LIFE.

"then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter?   It's more about the tyranny behind taxation. In the terrible shit-storm that government has created thus far, it is almost impossible to eliminate most taxes today. However, we should be progressing past the need for taxation all together. Create a new system dependent on proper justification for spending and taxation (if necessary).  The taxes today are irresponsible and incomprehensible by average Americans. Many people have to pay someone just so they don't accidentally miss any payments. The tax bracket is better now than it has been at times, but it is unrealistic. Taxes on Capital Gains are basically taxing the same income twice.  Taxes for subsidizing wheat and corn, and products made by wheat and corn are taxed. Most states have sales tax asking that people pay the government if they wish to buy an item. Taxes on property, saying that you can't even have shelter without paying the government.  This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. The idea that an authority figure can charge you for buying something from someone else is kind of ridiculous, yet it is currently the case.  So it's not so wise to just say ""yeah, taxes should go up because what about the debt?"" The debt is from irresponsible spending from the government. The government is now asking us to pay for their mistakes. Furnishings that don't even benefit most of us. TJ called this shit tyrannical for a reason.   Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something.   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate. People do not end their pursuit of profit just because government has made things more expensive for them. They will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses.   As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions.   As shown, historically (as I've pointed out a few times already), private endeavors succeed far more in spreading wealth across the nation than public efforts. This is because government has no concern for efficiency. While welfare and social services may be for noble reasons, they have been unsuccessful in getting people out of the slums. Allowing businesses to operate unrestricted creates growth. More goods and services are provided at a cheaper rate because the business men want to make these items cheaply. They don't want expensive items. Expensive items mean less consumers.  As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). It goes all the way back to the bourgeoisie and we see it today with the monopolies created solely by government. The largest of corporations owe most of their strength to government regulations and restrictions that have hurt small business, subsidization and contracts that has chosen winners, and ridiculous business taxes that small businesses couldn't keep up with.   Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market.   The ""corporatist"" legislation includes major regulations on the market. Government should not have the power to put such restrictions on individuals, yet we give it that power by claims of non-trust for the free market. Free markets is very far from corporatism.   Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities.   Even if we look to a futuristic utopia where the Free Market has prevailed over tyrannical government, government's place will still be to provide basic needs (security, vouchers for food and healthcare) at a much cheaper and efficient rate. However, government currently is a bureaucratic mess and the only defense that people can have for it all is the fear of an alternative that has never done harm (in fact, 'regression' towards free markets has done wonders for the economies of the USSR and China).  Vouchers (like food stamps, or the Paul Ryan healthcare plan) are cheaper and allow the market to do what it does best, compete for customers. It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it. That is currently, however, not what government does.   I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Hardly. The expense of most food industries comes from heavy regulation and taxation. One is not allowed to sell food without going through months of expensive protocol. How can a poor person in a poor neighborhood afford to do that or keep up with all business regulations and fees? This is what impoverishes the people the most.  A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a ""red herring.""   The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession.   Way to leave out the most important part. When the recession was occurring, the Icelandic government PANICKED and made drastic action believing that the banks wouldn't be able to handle the downfall of the European Union's dollar (the EU had much to do with this, sir). Iceland surrendered ownership of their banks to government regulators and this is where all hell broke loose. Now, the development of the banks was already a fault of government, as government, as I explained before, should have NOTHING TO DO with the banks. No start up help, no subsidies, no regulations, no nothing. Iceland would not have been able to invest so much power into three banks if they had completely avoided that market. As I've stated, it is better to either have a Centralized bank or no government involvement with banks at all. I'd choose the latter, especially today, because of the great catastrophe government has created in the banking and currency systems.   Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement   If government had stayed out of it all along, none of this would have been an issue. Iceland would have been one of the countries to avoid the mess that the EU and US created with their meddling in the private sector.   (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? Is it government's role to build up such monstrous corporations only to try and tame them and make them take care of us poor folk who need a nanny state? I find it quite shaky when we say ""hey Frankenstein, make us one of them monsters to push us around.""   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers. For good reason, it's not very good to give the religious a voice in politics. But that's just my opinion.   it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.   Sure, but saying that still doesn't make a difference in what we're talking about.",0

"her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK   I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you. A man is HALF the responsibility of a  pregnancy . It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?",1
"Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life.   When it comes to rape, women can have choice to abort or not abort. I support either decision. However, it is immoral to abort always. I also believe it is selfish.   If you are just careless, don't abort. It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault. Why not the man's fault too? Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.   But this topic is pointless. Selfish or not, a murderer will kill, a rapists will rape, a ""abortionist"" will abortion. What are you going to do? Keep an eye on the woman? You can and i believe you are doing a good deed. But i am not going to spend the rest of my life watching over a woman and stopping her from getting an abortion EVERY time. It is sad what i have said. That i won't help. But i have a life and this is not what i want to do with my life. To put this in short, if a woman wants to get an abortion, SHE WILL GET AN ABORTION.

Do you even know what ""overpopulation"" means?    lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.",0

"Your ""consenting adults"" requirement doesn't hold water because that can be legally changed as well. In the old days the age of consent was much lower.  The point that I'm trying to make however is that the best definition of marriage is exactly what it currently is because it is very specific. The whole purpose of language is to add clarity, not to obfuscate the issue. If you want a word to mean the union of two human beings, then come up with one. Don't obfuscate the language.",0

"So are some rapes good?  There is only one truth.  If there is an car accident and there are ten observers who are interviews by the police....there are ten different accounts to the story. That does not mean that there are ten ways it happened. There is only one way it happened and one truth.   The truth is the truth even if we can't see it.   What is radical about saying that abortion is wrong? It once was murder in America it was not radical back then. Does morality change? Is pedophelia wrong? Is there gray area in that?  What Hitler did...was that right or wrong...where is the gray area concerning the ovens?   Were the 9-11 radicals right in taking down and killing all those on 9-11?   You said something completely contradictory here....""To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.""  You say its wrong....but its right. If you say the woman has the right to kill because it is her body...then you cant deny her this right throughout the entire pregnancy. Which means that you are killing way beyond the time of viability. Is the fetus less human at three months...than at nine? If you are pro-choice...then the answer to this would not make a difference.   Humans judge humanity all the time....our police, teachers, clergy, court systems, parents. We all judge. You are judging me by the statements I make.   I do not need you to tell me what is right and wrong, or anyone for that matter. I do not believe that it takes a village to raise a child. I believe we are responsible for what we say and do, that we are capable to decide for ourselves.   What is a human being?    http://www.thefreedictionary.com/human   It is a fact that the human being in the womb is alive before the abortion...is dead after the abortion. The human is killed. It is not an animal....a rock......it is human and has all the characteristics of a human being...even at the embryonic stage. A human is a human...whether alive or dead. This Cassie Anthony murder trial....Kaylee was found in skeletal form, nevertheless they were human remains. That which is in the womb...whether at one month, or nine....is human.  You said, ""If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.""  Humanity is not measured by consciousness. If so...the mentally retarded, those in comas, vegetative stages do not deserve it and can be treated like you say.... like masses of soulless meat. A hearless and barbaric statement to make.....  How do you know when a sould inhabits the body? In Christian scriptures....God controls this ...""before I formed you I knew you."" For you to say when a body has a soul.....is impossible. Are you god?  And if you are a humanist....why are you even mentioning souls....?  ""It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.""  Mass of meat? Are you a butcher or something? LOL   To say that those who are unconscious are not human have no soul.....that is insane and not scientific at all.   Just curious what you think about these...  Abortion to purify the races. (Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood, hated blacks and targeted them through abortion. Hitler admired her.)  Abortion for profit. Women selling their fetal body parts for cash.  Abortion because something is wrong with fetus...wrong sex, hair lip...etc  Abortion to control the population.   Like I said you are all over on this. Abortion is right, no its wrong when.....and when that time is you cant pinpoint. No one could do this while the human is growing in the womb.   Do you know when they can detect measureable brain waves in the womb? Why should this matter to you?       http://www.buzzle.com/articles/ brain-development-in-fetus.html     So all of a sudden at some time (you cant pinpoint) abortion is wrong. BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID EVERY WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO OWN HER BODY AND DECIDE FOR HERSELF?   As I said.....your comments are morally baffling...make no sense.",0
"A gay person isn't sterile by default. Nature didn't withold anything from them, they just generally don't sleep with people with whom they can make a kid.   Can you give some evidence for your assertion that having gay parents makes a kid uncomfortable?",1
"How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   semantics...   Hey, you were the one who wanted to play this game ;)   And I can give many that are not.   Therefore, you are committing the genetic fallacy. Because whether or not the definition comes from the OED has no bearing on whether the definition is true or not. I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.   Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged? I am well justified to go down this road.",1

I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is:  abortion takes the life of an innocent human being  That' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it? And genetically it is human. It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it.   Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.,0

"Yes we can!"" roared the crowd. It was an emotional night for everyone. The 2008 presidential election was over. John McCain had lost to the first major party endorsed African-American presidential candidate in United States history. We finally closed troubling chapters in our history such as Mississippi burning and the civil rights marches of Selma.  Republicans, including the bewildered Religious Right, sat stunned in their seats wondering what would happen to their country. It was not because the Democratic Party was any different from the Bush Administration but because the GOP had pathetically lost its neo-conservative bully pulpit in the White House.  Democrats cheered with glee at the opportunity to take back the power that was theirs during the Clinton Glory Days. They salivated at the prospect of re-introducing neo-liberal interventionism on foreign soil and overseas markets They longed to once again crank the Dollar presses to inflate the money supply in the name of the ""poor"" this time instead of ""business"". They would gladly finish the work of the Fall of the American Empire started under the Bush Regime.  And now, the smoke and mirrors game goes on. The crooked politicians of 2009 are no different than the corrupt politicians of the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties. Crony capitalists like oil barons and railway tycoons then lined the pockets of our nation's representatives to further the goals of Big Business and destroy the wealth of American workers. Sound familiar?  President Obama had a unique opportunity in history -- and he blew it. He brought us ""change"" indeed. He slammed the Bush Doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper-drive. The rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism.  If there is one thing Americans say about Obama it is this: he cares.  He cares for the mechanic in Detroit who lost his job. He cares for the middle-aged couple living in the Hooverville tent outside Sacramento. He cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in Toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored.  But does Obama really care?  In fact, his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old Ronald Reagan playbook we knew as trickle-down economics. These days the compassionate White House grants bail-out money to financial monsters like AIG and Bank of America. There could be no better help for the American veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just aren't any more jobs. (Unless of course, you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening.) The idea is that bail-out money will sooner or later trickle-down to the great unwashed masses of Americans wondering what in Sam Hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts.  It may only be a drop of financial bail-out -- but hey it trickled down. Next up, bread lines!  The truth is that the White House allowed corporate giant CEOs to loot and pilfer the public treasury. This Administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from Baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at Guantanamo Bay.  The left-right political paradigm in this country is a sham. (Sorry to disappoint my fellow Evangelical Christians.) Both parties have proven to be Big Business, Big Government warmongers. For those who actually wished McCain had been elected just think about this: the GOP would have put up no opposition to the new President's Stimulus Package and would have rammed through trillions more in ""help"" for America.  So there you have it. President Obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal -- and all with a smile.  How is the left-right scenario a sham? Consider the following.  The gay rights issue is a political distraction. Stem cell research? Just more Big Research pork-barrel spending. Abortion? It's the political Gordian Knot that requires even the most astute of political science majors to bust a gut if they dare try to untie it. The so-called immigration invasion? A typical act of sensational yellow journalism that says, ""Look over there, Bubba! It ain't your own government stealin' your hard-earned dollars, it's them Mexicans lookin' for revenge and dishwasher jobs since the Alamo!"" Sorry, Pat Buchanan, the ""Death of the West"" comes from the corruption in our government, not the immigrants heading back home in record numbers.  What are the real issues of post-election America? For starters, the destruction of individual wealth in this country, save for the high upper class. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the Great Depression and will take decades to recover. There is no need for a conspiracy theory here -- only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves.  We must not waste time. We must move our already-compromised and over-valued U.S. Dollars into assets of real value. This does not include real estate unless you're buying ten cents or less on the high-priced dollar. Forget your 401(k), pensions and your annuities. Unless you can take your money out, they are toast. The stock market is one toxic graveyard, particularly finance shares. Dump them. Invest in precious metals, food supply, cigarettes, alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the Dollar collapses.  Consider buying silver, palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex.com. I personally recommend silverbullion.com because I support the goals of the owner Jason Hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange. Remember, that despite the U.S. Treasury's naked assertions, the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves the right of individual States to mint legal tender coins so long as they're gold or silver.  When the dollar collapses, I do not think that New York City will burn or that the United States will come to an immediate end. But if it did, the blame must rest entirely on Barack Obama and his Congressional Criminal Syndicate.  Some might here criticize me as being unfair. After all, George W. Bush The Evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars, his blatant lies to stir Americans to bloodshed, his deliberate obstruction to the 9/11 Commission, his last-minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions, his economic tinkering with interest rates, his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children, his doubling of the national debt, et cetera, et cetera.  But let me be clear about this. George W. Bush is a public menace. He and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes. But that will never happen under an Obama Presidency, in spite of the President's left-leaning brand of crony capitalism. The Truth Commission currently at play in the Congress is merely a circus show to fool Americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture, invasion, occupation, mayhem, pillaging, looting, rape, pollution, perjury, bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war.  Every moment that the Obama Administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former Administration, it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new President has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his Democratic base and the American voter. The White House today has continued in the same deadly bait-and-switch tactics of the former Village Idiot-In-Chief. Additionally, Obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the ""War and Bankers Party"" on both sides of the aisle.  For a President to vociferously take on Rush Limbaugh the GOP's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal. Besides the fact that the Democrats want to point out the weakness of the GOP's leadership vacuum, Obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution in light of the economic crisis. Are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian Hugo Chavez, who is a regular media personality, cheer Obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries?  Evangelical Christian radio stations are scared stiff about the Democratic-led Congress reviving restrictions on Americans to share their religious opinions over the people's airwaves. And they should be concerned. (I particularly enjoy my local station.) After all, the same kind of government that monitors, censors, filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals, plunders and coerces its own people. One look at China's control of the internet and Google's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian's skin crawl. Reports that Australia is considering Chinese-style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves.  So why is President Obama responsible for our economic debacle?  Because it's the first rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. If he didn't like the prospect of being stuck with the mess of his predecessor he should have remained in the Senate or considered an honest living like working for AIG or Lehmann Brothers. Obama has not only repeated the same unconstitutional trespasses of Bush II, but he actually increased the amount of corporate welfare to the Bank Barons. Obama turned a blind eye to the Federal Reserve's arbitrary usury practice through the printing of increasingly worthless U.S. Dollars.  Are we really going to see a Dow Jones 4000? The answer is regrettably yes -- and then some. There are economic forces at play that will no longer be ignored or manipulated. Human behavior will always gravitate towards self-preservation and the protection of our future generations through wealth-building, capital, production and labor. All the paper fiat money and government spending in the world can never stop that or help this economic disaster recover without drastic corrections to our own cursed speculative market. The times of fast and easy money are over.  President Obama has not even finished his first year in office and I must already call him out as one of the worst Executives ever in the history of our Republic. Bush II is close behind. Every GOP and Democratic elected leader that voted for any of these crooked bail-outs deserves a one-way ticket to an electoral defeat. Should state law allow it, a public tar-and-feathering might be in order.  When our country faced economic dangers, depressionary woes and international volatility let it be said that President Obama failed to protect us from the corruption of Congress, the indifference of the Judiciary and the foolishness of the People. Let it be said that he abandoned his post to uphold the Constitution. Let it be said that he whored his policies and his office for the rich and powerful, both foreign and domestic. Let it be said that we voted for change and all we got was the Raw Deal of the Obama Failure obama is a failure",0

Marijuana has more of an addiction effect than alcohol does.   Whoa! Now that is just not true. Have you consumed both?

"the truth of the principle is self evident.? You mean that, in your opinion, the principle is false, right? First, logically explain me why do you think this is absolutely false, as in, there's absolutely no situation in which this could be true, no matter which other factors are involved.   No, the principle of pro-abortion is: “Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.” The principle is true to fact; it is not false to fact. My assertion is indicating the ethical standard of pro-abortionists. I am not saying that their principle is good or just, I am affirming the principle of their agenda.  Now, consider the principle of the anti-abortionist: Human fetuses and embryos are not sacrificial.  Does this help?      Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion... I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society. At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be ""banned"". This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it. I just came into this one because I saw your comment about criminals and the undebatable, so now I'm here just looking forward to seeing you logically prove that there's absolutely no situation in which sacrificing a human embryo is the less of two evils. I'm looking forward to a debate.   I’ll reply to this part after we clearly understand one another about the truth of the principle of pro-abortion. This is a fair approach.",0
"Most Americans don't what gay marriage to be legal.   With respect to same-sex marriage, it's become an issue of the tyranny of the majority. Surely even you can recognize that there have been a number of movements that overcame the opposition of the majority to become constitutionally bound.   Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature.   A large number of animals have homosexuals within their population. Nature has nothing to do with it. Miscegeny was also constitutionally outlawed in the majority of states, and it took a constitutional amendment to allow its practice to be legal. It's not surprising that conservatives have been using the same bloody arguments that you and people like you (oh yeah, conservatives) use with respect to homosexuals and homosexual marriage are nearly the exact same arguments people were using during the days of anti-miscegenation.    We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.   Which has no bearing on policy. And if it does, it's unconstitutional.   Homosexuality is abnormal.   So is left handedness.   Most people are not gay.   Most people aren't crippled from birth, either, but it doesn't stop us from making legal provisions for their equitable treatment.   It goes against my beliefs.   Of course it does. So what?   And I have a right to those beliefs.   But no right to turn your personal beliefs into policy. That, my friend, is unconstitutional - certainly if it's religious. And if it's just because gays and lesbians, transexuals, and vestites, and bisexuals make you queezy, then you have no legal ground to stand on either.   As far as I'm concerned, it's just a matter of time.

Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children.   I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work.",1
"Hey, my religion is against that, but that dosent mean it has to be outlawed for everyone  We live in a land of ""freedom"", even if we can't exercise taht freedom sometimes. It's just violating a citizen's right to free will to prohibit gay marriage.   I'm not really into gay marriage, but if other people are, i wish u luck in standing up for your beliefs",1
it is also the mother's choice. the child doesnt have no say. as i said they shouldnt be having any sexual activity. i am 11 and i know this....,1
wouldn't that be a pro-choice opinion?,1
"I probably should clarify. I'm here because it interests me to know what reasons people have. I support do support gay marriage. In England the debate has come down to whether or not a legally identical thing (Civil-partnerships) should be renamed marriage. In my mind, both sides are being pedantic over wording and I think it's pretty pointless. However, if it was a matter of race, I would support changing ""black marriage"" to just marriage, so that's the view I have to hold here as well.  They're not crazy, they're Christian. They have been taught forever to overthrow their own view of morality and reason, and instead accept what some guy in a big building up the road tells them. I think I can forgive them on the grounds of ignorance. I can't forgive the millions of straight men and women that couldn't be bothered to vote simply because the issue didn't directly affect them.",1

"So, are you suggesting that if woman became pregnant accidentally, she should go through with that pregnancy  just  to hand it over to someone else? Isn't that a bit dangerous for both of them?",1
"What an ignorant thought. Of course you would have existed. While you obviously wouldn't realize what was happening,   If I had no awareness of my existence before it was terminated, then it is not really a factor to me.    it is still a horrible violation of human rights.    Looks like you got a little mixed up. Not forcing a woman to incubate a fetus she doesn't want is a  preservation  of a human right; the right to bodily autonomy.   Studies have shown again and again that when aborted, the baby is not just a lifeless blob of tissue, it is A LIVING BEING. You jusyt won't accept the evidence. I don't what else must happen to rid you of your foolish thoughts.   Nobody is arguing that a fetus is a lifeless blob of tissue. What they are arguing is that it does not deserve all the rights of a conscious and/or independent human being, especially when granting them such rights would override the rights of an  actual  person - the mother.",1

We also need someone that is willing to recognize the policies that have worked in this country in the past and around the world and those that have not. We do not need an ideologue. We do not need arrogance. We do not need to be treated like ignorant, lazy people that have no passion, drive or work ethic. I could go on, but I simply encourage all of you to put your party affiliations aside and objectively think about these comments as you decide who to vote for. Our country is at a turning point and has significant needs. We cannot afford for voters to retreat to the political party talking points.  Research the issues and do not rely on your 10 minutes of daily news. Think. What is truly best for our country?",0

"I hope you are not lumping in with those 4. I'm not hurt by it personally. I'm an outsider looking in and providing input as to what it looks like from where I'm standing and suggesting a way forward. Bypass the religious right, forget the word ""marriage"" and focus on obtaining your rights through civil unions.  Gays should embrace their difference and chose to create a word that elevates gay unions above the divorce wrought hetero marriages.  The religious right thinks the word belongs to them. They're going to fight for it. Proposition 8 is indicative of how hard they are willing to fight. They are willing to go to the mat. They are not going to roll over. This battle is going to slow the gay community as they attempt to gain their rights. They need a fast track to their rights. Go around the religious right. Forget the word, get your rights now! Focus on what is truly important like being by your partner in his/her time of need if (God forbid) they are ever in the hospital. You should have that right now. You shouldn't have to wait while you argue over a silly word.",1
"This is not the first time that drugs have been illegal, and it will not be the first time that the have been legalized. Consider the 18th and 21st amendments, which prohibited and legalized alcohol, respectively. The 18th amendment caused the rise of organized crime, and thousands of people died from drinking wood alcohol. With the 21st amendment, much of that went away.  Something similar will probably happen with Cannabis and other drugs. Once they can be regulated by the FDA and sold in reputable stores, the amount of crime will go down and quality will go up.",1
"Ok, now you're being dramatic and it's not funny at all. If you're not a woman experiencing PMS then you really have no excuse, but if you are then calm down and see my point. It's really quite workable:  Ok, what I mean is make ""sex that results in an unwanted pregnancy"" illegal. Ok, unwanted pregnancy is the key. Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury. You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT. If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!!!! A hefty fine is a very good deterent. You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion. This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive. The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc... You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.  So, as with seatbelt wearing in a car, over a short period, people would all learn to do it responsibly and it will become second nature and not have to be such an issue. Don't make it illegal, regulate it and everyone's a winner.",1

"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery. It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)  Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small. Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people. A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences. There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body. You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions. Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established. A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.   Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).   Morality only applies to the parent when there is an abortion because the fetus is not yet a person - moral actions are between people and about the responsibility to actual people. Fetuses have not met the necessary requirement. This has to do with intrinsic vs extrinsic value - the fetus has no intrinsic value (no value from within).  The fathers rights are always categorically less than the mothers. he can express a claim but this claim can be superceeded by the mother.",0
"But you are wrong…it is you just don't hear about it. And if you are pro-choice then…what is the problem with it? Do you not want to be put on the spot during the Super bowl if someone in your group says wow…who could be for that? Then you would have to say well I condone it…I am pro-choice? Or you could sit there and hide your opinion and just agree so you don't look bad.   I don't have to look it up. Have you ever heard of Tiller…the doctor that was killed for doing late term abortions? He did them like this as do clinics all over the country. YOU DONT HEAR ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY HIDE IT…IT IS ILLEGAL. It is done. Last year alone two late term abortion clinics were shut down…one in LA and one in New Mexico. It is done and you are very naive if you think it isn't. And as I said…..is there something wrong with abortion Saurbaby? If you are pro-choice it should be legal because your position stands on the fact that no woman should have to carry something if she does not want to do it. That would enslave her. So if she wants an abortion say at eight months….it should be ok.   The picture is accurate and true. You yourself said in this post….""Abortion is not done like that ANYMORE."" Which….LOL implies that you know it was done and the picture is accurate.  Did you know that in that tiny clump of cells…22 days after conception when most women don't even know they are pregnant…the heart starts beating. Yea…in that blob you think is nothing.

"The frightening thing about the abortion debate in this country is that not enough attention is brought to the fact that white men often have the strongest opinion on the matter.  While I am in NO way religious, I understand that some people are religious, and that abortion goes against their beliefs.

"It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is ""all"" or ""most"" or even ""vital"" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.   Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion.   I am out-maneuvering you. You only think one step at a time, but I'm several steps ahead of you. Learn to concede when you are off topic and we'll get along fine.   Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us.   How young are you? A teenager? You sure are wide-eyed if you think law and the justice system are about truth.  Juries are made up of peers, average blokes. Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me?

"I strongly believe that Obama should be given a second term. Since Obama has been in power, he has been trying his best to make certain achievements. We all know, that in the state that our ecomony is, it will not take weeks or months but possibly years to fix or embetter and for this reason, we should give him another chance since his leadership has cultivated many presidential achievements. We tend to blame him for not trying his best to embetter the economy but what we are failing to understand is the fact that this is his first term in office and the economy is not something you can fix in a second, it is a critical aspect that requires careful thought, planning, analysis and actions which can take several years. It is also through President Obama and his supporters that the health care bill, legislation to curb green house gases and improve the environment passes, preventing a second great depression by saving three large car manufacturers from going out of business and which would have possibly leave hundreds or thousands without jobs, and also passed the largest economic stimulus bill, bringing the war in Iraq to an end, thus saving the economy a lot of money and innocent lives from being taken, nuclear non-proliferation movement, repairing our image abroad, reversed George Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign organizations that allows abortion, lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell research, implementation of education system reform, tobacco regulation, financial industry reformation, appointing two Supreme Court Justices.

"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.  Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.  Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.    Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.  Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. WORDS: 981",0
"The difference is you're stopping the development of a fetus, which is not yet a life on its own. Killing a baby is taking an independent life.  The fetus is a parasitic organism until it can survive outside of the mother's womb. This is around 20 weeks.",1
"You demand logic? Try demanding some sense out of yourself!  Did you actually read the whole thing? My whole argument? Or did you just skip a few lines along the way through???  My point overall was that this debate is biased and complex, and that no sound amount of ""logic"" is going to convince anyone.  This topic demands what a person ""thinks"" and ""feels,"" not how he pulls out a statistic or two and calls a problem an ""effect."" The correct answer is that an abortion is both, and yet you fail to see how I have clearly solved the problem for both sides.   Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens.  Think about that.  If you actually ""pieced"" my arguments together, you would actually notice that I am actually not calling for an immediate ban on abortions. With the right plan, an abortion will no longer be necessary, and will be naught but bad memories.  I give you educational examples and you deny them without giving them a second thought. Wow, that shows a lot of character. Clearly you are the most biased debater on this site.

"You keep making counter-arguments based on examples outside of what I am referring to. I am not talking about any zygote. We could argue in circles all year with various banter to this degree.  I am referring to the specific zygote that results from the fertilization event after intercourse, between two human beings.   So artificially inseminated women can get abortions and clones can be aborted now. Where's your irrational bleeding heart now?   I'm not talking about an animal or genetically engineered cells or whatever crazy outlandish example that you keep pulling out of your arse.   This isn't 1950, and medical science isn't like the old Frankenstein movies of the old days. Mammalian cloning has been done many times in the past, and cell biology is a maturing science that allows the techniques I disclosed as a matter of common practice. Human cloning isn't special, it's just presently illegal.   Correction: fully grown humans are defined by that. Those humans had to go through a growing stage before they gained all of the abilities that you mentioned. During that growth, they are not fully grown but are still human life.   Again wrong. Babies and toddlers have a very simple capacity to reason, think and grow. This is afterall why they can learn language and our culture.   I am not concerned with it because the premise of my argument is indifferent with relation to the law. I am strictly dealing with morality. It use to be legal to own people. Thank goodness people didn't take the position that you are taking.   Oh yes, I remember slavery. Back in those days the Negroes were considered inferior creations, descended from god's disfavoured, cast-away people. It was thought that our moral duty was to own them because we could elevate them from their primitive culture and bring them some form of civilisation. To do otherwise, to let them have ownership of their own bodies was considered the same as allowing them to return to laziness and unproductivity.  Just another one of history's great examples of what happens when morals are imposed upon people without their consent for their greater good.   You still have failed to disprove what I said. We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware. The exact moment of self-awareness is extremely important if you want to prove your argument, but you simply cannot do so. You wrote a check that your mind couldn't cash.   I thought it was obvious, but I'll try again since you seem to need help here:  At what point does a fetus respond to stimuli? At what point toes it show signs of memory? At what point does it have a central nervous system? Answer all three questions and you have a reasonable cut-off period for abortions, or at least a decent argument for one.   Sure it matters. One method is natural and another method is unnatural. I don't advocate human cloning either, even though that could result in more human life.   I'll repeat myself: unnatural versus natural means squat. Find a logical distinction, and don't rely purely on what feels good.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy   Your argument to my point that all cells have the potential for life as a fetus does, is something like ""but it's not natural!!!""   http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html  (checkmate)  I never said anything about the zygote having a soul. My position is that it is human life, therefore to end that life at any point should be considered murder.    You might want to do more research.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction    http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/                                      3500603.html     http://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm    In other words, PBA (Intact dilation and extraction) accounts for under 1% of abortions as of 2000, and about 5% as of 2003.  In other words your argument that babies' brains are being sucked out is a peripheral one that does not cover the main issue: the vast majority of abortions don't abort fetuses with brains, but instead embryos.   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png     I'm not concerned with you bizarre hypothetical that completely ignores that basis of which we have been debating on. At no point did I say sperm or a woman's eggs were human life. The conjoining of the 2 in a fertilization event which results in a zygote is human life. (Naturally through intercourse)   Your argument that embryos and fetuses are human lives is as absurd as my ""bizarre hypothetical"" and what's more your position is backed almost exclusively by religious agenda and not reason, again like my ""bizarre example.""  I have a question for you: if you care so deeply about embryos and young fetuses being aborted (the vast majority of abortions fall under this, after all) why aren't you setting up adoption centres that give money to couples who choose to have the child instead of abort it? Why aren't you donating time and effort to foster services? Why aren't you looking for research teams, or developing research teams to find ways to emulate a uterus for incubating embryos?  In other words at the moment you're just being an opinionated jackoff who isn't DOING anything to help the situation. You have a feeling, an opinion that somehow an embryo deserves equal rights as a human being, but you're not showing an inkling of care for the women that must suffer if your opinion had any weight.   And I ridicule you and everyone who thinks like you do. You inject new, fabricated, unrealistic hypotheticals into the debate and expect it to make sense. You can try to justify abortion all you want by bringing animals and artificial matters into the discussion but it is painfully obvious that you are searching frantically for an excuse to allow the taking of innocent human life.   I expect it to make sense because I figured that you had the intelligence to imagine your argument taken to its logical extremes. I don't have to wring my hands and sweat over the treatment of fetuses, zygotes and embryos as less than human because I genuinely do not feel anything towards them. Your attempts to elicit emotion by conflating fetuses with infants also does nothing to me because I feel no emotion towards them either. We may as well be discussing the building of a fence.",1

"""Extra Bunch of Cells?""  Maybe not to the same extent as, say, scraping the inside of your cheek or scratching a layer of epidermis with your fingernails, but they lack any human fetus or vertebrae features until well into 3 months of development. Otherwise, what you'd see under a microscope really would just be unremarkable ""cell"" reproduction.     I'm sure what Hollow more accurately meant to say was ""blastocyst,"" which is really just a scientific term for the pre-fetus stage of conception in which the developing embryo really IS just a clump of cells that begin reproducing after the fertilized ovum has attached itself to the uteran wall. For the technical definition, see:  Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.

"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  ""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.",1
"""Q134. ""Is there anything in the Constitution, Bill Of Rights or any Amendment that adds to discrimination due to race, color, or creed? I thought that 'Sexual Preference' was added, but I am told that I am wrong.""  A. There is nothing anywhere in the Constitution that specifically bans discrimination based on sexual preference. There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts.

However, sexuality is one of the most complex psychological processes of humanity and thus there is not a conclusive answer on the whole nature vs. nurture argument. So basically your statement is ""unfounded"" as well.",1
"1. I'm pretty sure nature,  not  God,  did  intend for parents to be heterosexual couples. Why else would we reproduce sexually? A mother and a father can make a baby, and thus a mother and father are more equipped to raise a child.  2. True, unnatural doesn't mean  bad . But does it necessarily mean good?  3. You have no right to tell me to denounce my religion. I happen to love my religion and just because you don't believe in a higher being does not mean the whole world must think like you.",0

"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.",1

"You are apparently a moron.   Does the bible not speak of marriages before Christ was born?   Homosexuality is not against Christianity, for homosexuality is not an ideology but a description of sexuality, however some forms of Christianity are against homosexuality;   Marriage is also a secular, governmental institution, and very few, if anyone is suggesting churchs be forced to do anything other than stop using their influence for violating basic principals of secularism. There are governmental privileged and rights granted with a marriage LICENCSE, and there is no secular basis to deny homosexuals these benefits from the government.

"I am surprised you say that you don't care about what the laws say. Try telling that to a trial judge. Anyway, it is good that you made that point because a fetus is at a point where the brain is now developing making them unaware of the surrounding which is why people refers to them as being in the baby stage. But you are failing to understand that because of the destruction of those cells, the life of the person might be in danger which is why a criminal charge has to be instituted. The type of cells and tissues however that we are referring to is referred to as a developing human being who is growing into complete human form with a complete DNA and blood type. But didn't you say that what a woman does with her body is nobody's business then how come there are laws to prevent her from prostituting her body?  Okay. According to statistics released by the WHO in terms of abortion, the number of abortions that performed for the year 1995- 45.5 million of which 19.9 million were illegal.  According to a report from The Guttmacher Institute, Unsafe abortion causes an estimated 70,000 deaths each year, and an additional five million women are treated annually for complications resulting from unsafe abortion. Approximately three million women who experience serious complications from unsafe procedures go untreated.  The following methods describe the different methods of abortion. Since you are also a person of science read up on horrifying methods of abortion in which we do not even do this with animals;  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068  I agree but the only purpose abortion serves is to kill the fetus, a human life or organism. Condom does something better than what abortion does. Condom prevents the spread of diseases. And i also agree but how can it be explicit language when i have proof to back up my opinion released by the U.S Gov? Are we aborting a fetus because of fear of infection?  That i will agree with you. I am but a teenager not a child. There is a difference between a teenager and a child. A child is an individual who has not meet the stage of puberty. A teenager is an individual who has or is already going through the stage of puberty. And i also agree with you that there many things i can learn from adults, as long as i am learning it from the correct source. Well we are not discussing a debate based on politics; we are discussing abortion and the law. And i also agree with you that i do have a lot to learn. Oh and by the way now you are starting to use your critical thinking skills. I love that. Now i feel tha twe can openly discuss any topic.",0

"I don't like the way this question is phrased.   People should be ""allowed"" to be with whoever they want. And they're going to. Even if we decided to be unconstitutional and dissolve the separation of church and state how would you enforce peoples personal relationships? So naturally people should be legally allowed to  be with  whoever they want.   But that doesn't mean we have to change the definition of  marriage . The protection of marriage is about protecting the definition of marriage by law. So it's not a question of gay people being oppressed.   So ""gay marriage"" does exist in some states. So it's more a question of should the definition of marriage be changed at a national level. Why? Marriage is a religious thing. So it all seems kind of ironic. Most People for gay marriage are not religious.   It would be a good compromise if they formed some other type of union. I think they just wan't what they can't have. It's like two children and a toy.",1
"Firstly:  Gay relationships:  The majority of gay relationships last shorter then 6 months. (1)  Very few gay relationships surpas 2 years. (2)  Only 2.7% of gays have 1 partner throughout their whole life. (3)  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year. (4)  Another said they have 500-1000 throughout their whole life. (5)  Why should these rights be granted?   The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions. (6)  Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail.  Discrimination:  A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship. As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature. (7, 8) Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)   Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just. (7,8) Aristotle saw this as what you deserved, not what is given. (8, 9)    As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal ""right"" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost.

"“It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living?”  Anyone who bluntly says an unborn child is a living thing is missing the concept. People need a wider understanding of this topic as it is of huge philosophical importance. Does an unborn baby have self-awareness/sapience/soul/spirit/ intellect/free-thought?    If not, abortion is no crime  “I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions, that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash.”  Quite a harsh statement. Seeing as the main people who need abortions are teen mothers. These people are far-worse off than any person not capable of mothering children. I am guessing your auntie is aged 30-40, middle-class. These teens are pregnant; they get ostracized, have to fight for economic dependence and may soon be forced to limit the growth of their education to take care of a child. This will ultimately lead to very poor living standards for both of them in the future. If she doesn’t get an abortion, two lives are ruined and we have another generation of dysfunctional youths consisting of crack fiends, prostitutes, pimps, gang members and robbers. Low level income will force them to poor strata’s of society.   Don’t give me some inspirational story about how some mum got out of a life of hardship and she and her son are doing fine.

"Wow, you're really grasping at straws here aren't you? Because women are mistreated and female infants are killed in India, we should ban gay marriage? Is this what you're saying? Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.  The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:  1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted. This means that less female infants would be killed and could but instead could be put up for adoption.  2) It would make genders more equal. If a woman can marry a woman and start a family without a man then this empowers women. It means that they don't need men.   Honestly I'm pretty sure that I'm not understanding you. Is this a joke?

The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences   The law has only broadened which  consenting parties  can be married, the issue of express consent would still need to be addressed if your slippery slope is to be accepted.   If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference?   As long as there are two expressly consenting parties, then nothing should stop us from allowing other people to get married. An animal can't consent.

There is no difference between the two in Physics either.   But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.   I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you? I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the  need  for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.

In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I can't prove morality but morality exists.   If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   My morality even forbids me from killing species of animals  other than my own kind .   Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time.   No, they can't. That is still a contradiction.   you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate   I said ""irrelevant to the debate"", not ""irrelevant to our discussion"". Learn to read will you, idiot?   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.   These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Then why did you ""argued"" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed.    That is  not  an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.",1

"I am a straight Christian and support gay marriage. Why? Simple. Separation of church and state.   Gay marriage opposition states that they want to preserve the sanctity of marriage. Let's look at the definition of sanctity: the quality or state of being holy or sacred.   That tells me: you cannot preserve the holiness of an act that is governed by the law. That is a violation of church and state.   If someone, a Christian or other religious person, wants to get married under the eyes of God in their church, then fine. But it is not our place to impede upon the rights of others that want to be married under the eyes of the law. Or even God, for that matter. I know many gay Christians. It is not our place to judge others or take away from them. Prop 8 is threatening to take away the rights of 18,000 ALREADY MARRIED couples. And all because our religious views clash with their lifestyles. This is not our battle.   I support gay marriage, and I support my gay married friends and will continue to fight with them for their equality.

I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.  Fruits are not multicellular organisms, in the traditional scientific sense...they are a part of an organism...my testes are composed of living cells that respire and excrete but i do not consider them independant animals of their own right...  This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...  Now do you realise how illogical your absurd argument is?",0
"The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life   The ""drinks"" analogy was used to explain why we shouldn't go around changing the definition of words.

Drink OJs until you get OJ poisoning if you like :) But don't get an OJ and call it a lemonade and then expect others to accept that. Of course you're free to call an OJ a lemonade amongst yourselves. That's how you should relate the ""drinks"" analogy to gay marriage.  .

"You do not understand the Word of God because you are taking everything literally.

If you're debating science, you use scientific evidence. If you're debating a particular mythology, you use that mythology's canon as a reference. Is this so strange to you?  Why shouldn't I read the text literally? Because it doesn't give you answer you like? Christians are very strange this way, whenever you read the bible in a way that doesn't put your hindsight into it, or gives an answer that doesn't seem favourable, they say something like ""you're reading it literally"" but when you discuss science, or medicine, or politics, the same Christians will go right ahead ans say ""science is wrong!!! because it literally says the earth was made in six days.""

You are correct about the double homicide law; however the contradiction is inherent in the ruling itself. The double homicide law was only raised to illustrate this.

"First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion.   If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.",1
"Once again...  1. In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort? If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it, he's like all powerful or something right? He doesn't need your help asshole.  4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening.  5. Making abortions illegal has been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths.

"Marijuana, like tobacco, causes cancer as it contains carcinogens.    In the quest to investigate the link between cancer and marijuana, research can be roughly divided into two categories: lab research and investigation of long term users outside of the lab. Yes, as an unfortunate amount of lab animal deaths can attest, cannabis does contain carcinogenic molecules. However, research involving actual users paints a rather different picture.    http://scienceblog.com/10660/ study-finds-no-link-between-marijuana- use-and-lung-cancer/     http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/ story/2012-01-10/ Marijuana-doesnt-harm-lung-function- study-says/52483604/1    There is some controversy regarding the efficacy of these findings. Because marijuana is illegal, it is difficult to find users to participate in these studies, particularly finding heavy long-term users. It has been argued that if it were legalized, it would be much easier to find participants from a wider range of the population, and the information gathered could prove to be more accurate. Still, working with what we've got, it appears that marijuana use not only does not have anywhere near the effect that cigarette smoking does in terms of carcinogenic properties, it even seems to lower rates of certain types of cancer.    Marijuana is also highly addictive.   Not  highly . It is significantly less addicting than tobacco or alcohol, about on the same level as caffeine, but usually with less severe withdrawal symptoms. Pretty much anything that stimulates the reward centers of the brain will have some addictive qualities among a large enough sampling of users. But marijuana is very low on the totem pole compared to many legal and even non-regulated substances.    http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ the-teenage-mind/201012/ is-marijuana-addictive     http://health.ezinemark.com/ the-addictiveness-of-marijuana-or- cannabis-31e84cc7129.html     Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine.    Studies have also shown that most marijuana users drank alcohol before smoking pot. But alcohol is not considered a gateway drug. Why? Lower incidence of illegal drug use. But lets think about this for a second. As long as marijuana is illegal the people who use it can be classified as ""people who are willing to break at least one law."" Among adults, alcohol drinkers aren't classified that way. Some might be willing to, and those who are may end up using illegal drugs. Others will be totally law abiding, and since that is the majority of them, alcohol does not get considered a gateway drug. The only way to fairly compare the two would be to put them on the same legal standing and do studies at that point. Further, people who buy marijuana illegally have a greater exposure to other illegal drugs than those who don't since many dealers deal in multiple drugs. I suspect that the legal status of marijuana plays more of a role in its status as a gateway drug than any actual medical reason.    If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence.    The War On Drugs is at least partially to blame here. First, the strategy behind the WOD is to increase the cost. But since most drugs, marijuana included, are highly elastic commodities, this doesn't much reduce the demand. Instead it makes for wealthier drug lords, and competition between them leads to violence. The harder we crack down, the worse the situation gets. Also, we would make it less profitable for the drug lords by opening a legal channel of distribution and cultivation. Having marijuana as a legitimate source of retail would seriously reduce the number of people obtaining it illegally. It could also be regulated for quality and purity this way, which is currently not possible.",1

"First of all, the two options for this debate are a bit limiting and ambiguous. If we define ""hurt"" as directly set back or disadvantage, then no, gay marriage doesn't hurt even the most vehement of bigots. However, if we define ""hurt"" as having any influence in which a person may deem negative to themselves, then yes, it is very possible that it does.  I've sided with the ""doesn't hurt anyone"" because in GENERAL and DIRECTLY it does not influence people who oppose it.  John and Jim getting married and having sex behind closed doors, does not affect the daily life of big Pastor Joe in a direct way.  However, the long term social and political effects will have very real consequences for both Pastor Joe and the rest of society.  If we examine the effects of abortion laws, especially the revision those of 1973, we see how it is possible for legislation intending to provide more individual freedoms may affect the social dynamic. The 1.7 million abortions a year are seen with a more liberal attitude after Roe and other similar historic legal moments.  Compare the average attitude on abortion in 1920 to today, and you will find that the social dynamic has changed. As society becomes more liberal on a certain issue because of legislation, it is possible that Pastor Joe is now surrounded with a warped culture he does not enjoy. This culture, the effects of gay marriage, may very possibly ""hurt"" Pastor Joe in the sense that he is not happy with the effects of allowing it, later down the road.  Forced to chose one of the absolutist sides, ""Doesn't hurt anyone"" -- In general, right now, if John and Jim wish to go get a married, this does not influence my life. In an ideal philosophy, the actions of two consenting adults in private are of no business to anyone but themselves, thus ""doesnt hurt anyone.""",1

Obama is another Hitler. There is not an ounce of capitalism or freedom in him.  Why won't anybody in the media talk against him?  Its because of the fairness doctrine. You're not allowed to speak against him.  Stop listening to the liberal media.,0
"Jesus some people are retarded.   @ Itsnotright:  Banished? You didnt even spell it right you redneck retard. What are you doing on a computer anyway?  As for the question. Because most Americans are as stupid as ""itsnotright"" I would have to say that the economy has to just start making a come back around the time of the re-election. If it gets better and stays better earlier then all the gun toting gay hating people will come out and vote for the republican. If it doesnt happen at all or only minimally then people will blame him for not doing a good job and will vote the other way.   I voted yes on this question because I do think he will bring the economy around but I think it will take about three years which is right around election time.",1
"""focus on getting the government to stop using the word marriage""  You mean that word the government prints on what are they called? Oh, ya. ""Marriage"" Licenses.  Issuing a ""Marriage"" Licenses is a government service. It should not be denied to same-sex couples. It's just that simple.",1
"I'd like add a different perspective to your argument. I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.   The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.   Hope that clears things up for you.",0
OK lets stop rite now and lets look at Obamas accomplishments. No he will not win in 2012 unless he does some mighty big things until then.,0
See my other arguments disputing the founders of the debates args.,0
"Well, much of that argument is outside the scope of the debate. What would I do? Well, I, personally, wouldn't like it. But that doesn't mean it's  wrong.  That's where I think many people are missing the point. They aren't drawing the line between what they  like  and what is  right.",1
"Yes! Obama doesn't care about U.S. citizens at all, all he cares about is having his face put on the dollar bill!",0
"Because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality   No, you can disagree. I'm talking about the ridiculous hatred... as evidenced by the tag ""fuck him"" and basically every insane tea party.  1. okay so you hate him for taxes he hasn't raised... that makes sense ._.  2. the f-22 program wasn't a kick in the balls at all. It was a billion dollar program for planes the military does not use only kept alive because senators in respective states that made the planes have been too week to support cutting the program. And that the rate of our deficit increase has slowed since Obama took office, and our GDP increased.  3. It will actually bring everyone's cost down, including those who pay for it, including you if you pay for it. Under the current system we pay the most, including you, for the 33rd ranked healthcare in the world. It is a retarded system and had to be changed and Obama has been the only President strong enough to do such.  4. Again, so in spite of the chart I linked clearly showing the job situation has steadily improved since Obama has been in office, you choose to hate him based on some vague future fear fully imagined in your fevered head. And I'm sure you blame Bush's job loss on Clinton, makes perfect sense ._.  5. Wow, that's amazing, don't let other conservatives hear you give him credit for something, they'll lynch or pray for your soul or exorcise you or some other crazy ass thing.  Next section:  This is to point out that he's doing stuff not assoiciated with sacrificing kittens to satan or speaking to Hitler's ghost about ways of turning America into a socialist nation (that doesn't make sense on purpose). And that it is nice to have a president not born into it and who actually has a clue what he's doing.  And since you do agree on some things, I'm not going through point by point unless you have something specific you would like to debate.",1
