615,"It's not so much killing as denying a vhance at lfie. The argument isn't ""is it ok to kill a newborn"". Abortion involves fetuses and all the ""if it has nails it can feel pain"" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument ""we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance"" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than ""a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain"".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child. But they never say that, why?, because they would die alone. The way I see this debate, one side is blinly screaming ""somebody please think of the children"" and the other side is blindly screaming ""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to"".   Before you devote your lives to ridding the world of fetal pain, deal with the torture that is being carried out uncontested (even though it's often pulbicized=general knowledge), deal with the female genital mutilation, deal with the starving children, deal with the raped children, deal with the unwanted, beaten, emotionally damaged, forgotten, slave children that are a result of poor parental planning you backwards thinking, self-proclaimed advanced specie intellectuals who have nothing better to do than trivialize the pain that exists in this world.",1,1

If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, ""it takes a village to raise a child"".

9,"I think you contradicted yourself.   I'm suee you think thta, but your still wrong.   If the creation of jobs is interchangeable with the creation of wealth, then it must follow that the government creates jobs (and wealth) whenever it creates new organisations   Answer these questions.  How is government funded? Does government possess any assets without taxation? Does government have any financial spending power without taxation?  Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.   Those are not transferred jobs because there was never a private sector equivalent.   There is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the provided by private sector through law.   They produce technologies and monuments which are too expensive for corporations to create   Again, you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services. The private sector may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as NASA or USPS.  All of the employees who work at NASA or Defense, whose money is it that they are using? Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money came from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   Taxation takes surplus wealth from producers and uses it to fund the creation of these things.   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.  For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. Now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   The great depression was caused by insider trading and corruption of the stock market.   No, The Great Depression was caused by failure in central bankers.    Milton    Milton    If the market works like Natural Selection, and businesses behave like animals, then Keynesian policy would merely be that which applies artificial pressure to the evolution of business. If this is true, then it follows that the market's behaviours can be changed to correct social problems like unemployment.  This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   If this is true, then private businesses may never create a net addition to employment opportunities because they produce a heavier burden on other private businesses and employees, because a private business ""charges money for a service (same as tax), borrows money (loans), and prints coupons (similar to printing money practically).""   OH MY GOD. Anyway. What Next?   What I would be interested in hearing is how a tax is different from a sale, practically speaking. I'm not interested in how you're compelled to pay tax, because force is irrelevant to the immediate equation, which is the creation of jobs (and wealth) through the trading of money.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.  For instance, if a man wants to sell lemonade, he will get a loan from somewhere of 5 dollars. So, over the course of the summer, the man makes 15 dollars in revenue, but he must pay back the 5 dollars in loan, and now he has a profit of 10 dollars where he created new wealth and a job.  However, if government wants to sell lemonade, it must tax the man 5 dollars because it can't invest in anyone that of which it does not own because that is what it cost him to produce, so now, the child only only has a profit of 5 dollars, so the output is still 15 dollars, but it was transferred from private to public sector. Then, the 5 dollars that the government took, he could have reinvested and hired a partner to grow.   In the discussion about economics, what matters is that money changes hands.   And that money is who does the money belong to.   Those state sales permits and laws which prohibit business startup are usually motivated by business interests who wish to stifle competitors.   This is what I have been saying time and time again.   It's how capitalism works in democracy.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Right. We also needed it, since our healthcare coverage is so poor in this country.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.  If you wanted more expensive coverage, that is what you got. Congrats.   Government-funded research exists because most research is costly and unprofitable to the private market.   Never said that it is for only profit market. Research should be non profit.  Mayo Clinic is one of the most respected nonprofit medical research organizations in the world.   Polio's researchers and early efforts to make a vaccine used a similar lack of ethics: 3000 children were injected with an unsuccessful mixture which caused allergic reactions in some of them.    Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many.  REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.   Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   government takes over where private industry would fail or be less successful.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   As to the stem cells: you can thank Bush for regulating stem cells in the first place. Obama rescinded his laws.   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   It didn't, and wouldn't ask, as long as you didn't provide it. However what happened was that many officers and recruits were discharged annually because they were spotted in gay clubs on shoreleave, or ""outed"" by malicious coworkers.   Again, this resorts to bad government military policy because before, you could get dishonorable discharge for being gay. This type of policy is stupid.    I'm not sympathetic for big business.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   I think it does an admirable job handling the roads, sewers, water, schools, medical research, space programs, and research.   Well, Great! I am so glad that you feel proud of the progress that you support.    I certainly know that only a state could afford a project as big as the Large Hadron Collider.

Learning how to put a condom is the entire essence of reducing teen pregnancy and STD's. If safe-sex is performed by teenagers, then it is a non-contributing factor to pregnancy.    "" But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex; they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.""   Well... yes, it does help. You make the basis of this argument with the fact that teenagers are still engrossed in having sex, but what you fail to realize is that education has taught them how to enact safe-sexual procedures decreasing there chance of becoming pregnant. No one argues about teen sexual activity as it is irrelevant if they are doing under the influence of protection.    ""they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate.""   How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate.

Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it.

Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.  You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights.   People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.  As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they  had to base their decision on facts . When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.  So now, tallblondebigotedguy,  what are your reasons ? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage?

And by life I'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense, meaning the totality of ones existence, a life lived.   Here is why I think that is a dangerous position to hold. Basing the value of a human on it's potential is a subjective value judgment, someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life. If someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it. That's dangerous because that is how Germany began the road to the holocaust. It started with the sick, mentally retarded and elderly. The did it by making the value judgment that certain humans didn't have potential, they held no value for society. And following Darwin's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them. See potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways, it's what's know as an equivocal word.   You see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk, even you.   The safer ground to stand on is objective value. The value of the human is in the human itself. By the fact that it is human gives it it's value. This puts all humans on a level playing field. I can't come up to you and because I have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine. Taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race. We are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful.   I hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful. And now because of your power over them you can kill them freely, this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans.

280,"It is trie that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with rgeards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -""if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents."" - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.",0,0

421,"""Q134. ""Is there anything in the Constitution, Bilk Of Rigths or any Amendment that adds to discrimination due to race, color, or creed? I thought that 'Sexual Preference' was added, but I am told that I am wrong.""  A. There is nothing anywhere in the Constitution that specifically bans discrimination based on sexual preference. There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts. The subject is far from a closed one at this time.""  In fact I´m socked.

In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.  Fruit cells envelop seeds (usually) and they are alive. The only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall. Both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life. In the case of a fruit, the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs. In the case of a foetus, it may grow into a human. Both have this potential, but they are not presently realised.   This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...   I never said that apples were independent life forms, but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it.  Also, if you want to get into the biology of it, the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells, a relationship which evolved over many millions of years.

We are sitting on 200 years of oil, do you really think that its cheaper to pay and drill in countries over 3000 miles away? NO, drilling here at home will cost LESS, which the president does have control over FYI, if the president can decide when go to congress (which obama had not for libya) to declare war or raise taxes then he can open oil reserves with no problem.

That nazi...always spending money.  Except it isn't Obama's policy. It's Bush's that is driving up the debt.  Almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges:  1. Two unsustainable useless wars started, passed, and continued by republicans. It took Obama to end Iraq and create an endgame for Afghanistan pullout.  2. Two unsustainable, deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich. All passed, initiated, pushed, and signed by republicans.  3. An unsustainable social security increase. Take a guess as to who passed it?  4. An unsustainable Medicare Part D expansion, the single largest entitlement increase in United States history, and likely world history. Republicans sure are anti-entitlement small government fiscal conservatives aren't they...  -  But don't take my word for it. Here is Obama vs. Bush New Spending.  Obama is at a net $350 billion in non-recession spending (projected out for EIGHT years). Bush spent $4 trillion in the same time period.  Now look me in the eyes and call Obama a big spender.}  Ok I will,   1. Don't EVER call Iraq a stupid war, if you think going to search and destroy osama bin laden in Bush's war was stupid well your very undereducated. We didn't just roll into iraq with tanks for nothing, 9/11 triggered the war, If you can remember Republicans and democrats stood on the capitol with bush in and listened to the star spangled banner in agreement that war was absolutley necessary and then the democrats all ran away and blamed bush for the war. Democrats love to pay thanks to our shitty president for getting osama but what they dont realize this is BUSH'S WAR you all opposed and still do.  2. Do the poor create jobs? NO. Does the middle class, yea they contribute small business's but Steve Job's, Bill Gates, Alan Mulally, etc, the rich create the majority with jobs and what happens when you tax them to death, well they don't want to lose all the money of starting new corporations and new enterprises along with the taxes and regulations of the govt and they end up moving their business's to other countries where they can make a profit. Did you not read the part where 50% of Americans dont pay taxes and the rich make up for the 20% that do?! and you want to tax them more!?   3. Aren't the democrats the ones who want to spend money they don't have?  4. So theres 1 liberal thing a republican did, what if we added up all the shitty euro-style policies dems keep wanting to ram down the taxpayers throats? Look what each side spent it on, Bush's was the necessary war and obama's was his failed stimulus bill and obamacare that 60% of Americans want repealed TODAY?   {Who said liberals find it attractive?!?!?!  Liberals were AGAINST THE WARS!  AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS.  Where have you been living. Why do you think they are calling on revenue increases? To cut the deficit that Bush created from a projected surplus}  Ok first of all, incorrect liberals were for the war in 2001 and then they backed out of it blaming it on bush in ...2001.5.  Why raise taxes, CUT USELESS SPENDING, for example funding the egyptian military when they we just had to pay 5 million dollars to release American hostages from egypt!?!? the should FUND THEIR OWN DAMN SELVES!  YES the righties wanted taxes for the poor, CAUSE THEY DONT PAY ANY! GENIUS!   What was there to think about? was it that hard to give the go ahead to kill osama?

253,"OK, I'll go on rexord. homosexuality is  not  a chioce.  Having said that, I disagree with any court that claims marriage is a right anymore than driving a car is a right.  When I say something is ""a right"" I mean a God given right. For example, the right to pursue happiness. Gays are free to pursue happiness. Freedom is another right. Gays are free.  The U.S. cannot tell me who I can and cannot marry because I am the one who decides who to marry. The U.S. may not recognize my marriage but that doesn't impede on my decision (who to marry) nor does it impede my happiness. The only thing it impedes is any benefits I would be eligible for if the U.S. recognized my marriage.   A country has a right to decide what it will or will not recognize. The decision as to what it will or will not recognize is based on the majority. Anything else is just the tail waging the dog. A situation where the minority rules the majority and that is not right.  During the American Civil War, both sides had roughly the same number of people. Enough to sustain the war for 4 years. If one side had had more troops than the other, the war would have ended much quicker.   Eventually the side against slavery won. Eventually the North had enough people on its side to constitute a majority and end slavery. Slavery did not come to an end because it was immoral. Slavery came to an end because  the majority  did not want slavery.  Same thing with suffrage. Women did not get the right to vote because it was the right thing to do. Women got the right to vote because the majority of the people wanted it.  Currently, the majority of the people do not want gay marriage. If they did, gay marriage would be legal. I expect that to change in the near future. Any attempt to force the majority into some thing it clearly does not want is wrong.  The supreme court handed down their ruling. And yet, it is not the law of the land. Why? Because the majority does not want it. The supreme court's decision (without the sanction of the majority) is moot.  Now, you can go and fly in the face of reality and scream and shout, ""But the supreme court said...."" and you still wouldn't get any further than you are today. I, on the other hand, recognize reality for what it is and proposed an alternate solution around the problem. A solution that you said gay groups are pursuing.  So, you can dispute me all you want. It wont change a thing. Marriage will only become a right when the majority sees it that way. Until then, it is not a right. Regardless of what the supreme court says.

This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal.

Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.   Debt is created by a deficit. Less taxing means more debt.   And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Increased welfare spending was mandatory, it takes years to change the systems, and as far as I'm aware, it largely falls outside of his mandate (state law, not federal, I'd assume?).

Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do?   Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.    Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong?   No, I wouldn’t want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it (assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception). Religious ethics based on the idea of ‘sin’ or ‘evil’ has no effect on my decision; it’s about how I was raised.   What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Abortion is a murder.   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   But everybody has a right to be wrong.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.    Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion.   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really  fix  it?   How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.  I am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place. As for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control, i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want's to be a mom or have an abortion. I don't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions. If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.",1,1

""The rich own the small businesses that create the jobs,"" Obama's critics say. ""The rich are the engine of growth.""Well, excuse me, but on this planet what we've seen in the last couple of years is a lot of rich bankers and other unscrupulous speculators and con artists (they don't really deserve the dignified title of business people) destroy jobs on a gargantuan scale.   And back when the rich were creating jobs, those jobs weren't so wonderful. Just how many jobs created by the construction of condos, shopping malls and SUV production does this country really need at a time when our bridges and schools are falling apart, when millions don't have health insurance, when our energy system is based on 19th Century technology, and when we're starving our scientists and teachers?   The rich are no longer in a mood to create even lousy jobs. They are taking what's left of their riches and fleeing to the safety of treasury bills. They are still trying to figure out if their asset managers were funneling money to Bernie Madoff and other crooks.

Fortunately, the government intends to invest in things we really need like education, science, infrastructure, health care and renewable energy.

What supply-siders don't seem to understand is that government jobs are not a dead weight on economic growth. If we employ more teachers and firefighters and peanut-butter-factory inspectors, they will take their paychecks and go to the mall and buy the crap that private investment tends to favor. Vital services and crap can coexist.  Any decent country needs a balance between public and private investment. Yes, if the government runs everything, you get a dreary Soviet-style morass that makes almost everyone poor. But the starve-the-government-to-death (except for the war machine and corporate welfare queens) philosophy of the Bush era was leading us to a situation in which the rich were counting their dollars in gated communities, while the rest of society was going to hell -- even while enjoying the video games.

252,"I hope you do'nt mind, but I'd like to follow-up your lengthy argument wuth a lengthy redress.  While it is true that we do not know who will face-off against Pres. Obama, we can have a pretty good idea. Any of the republican candidates mentioned so far, Palin, Pawlenty, Huckabee, are more right than Bush or Obama, but they have managed to build small contingents of vehement supporters. Some of the possible candidates still question Pres. Obama's citizenship. That is simply ignorance. I would hate to see the country fall back into the lap of an embarrassingly inept executive.  Now I cannot argue that Pres. Obama is much different than the last president. Mr. Bush should not be defended for he was a reckless spender (Medicaid, Bail out), drove us into two extended wars, led us into massive debt, was utterly divisive, and spoke much more like Ford than Lincoln or Clinton for that matter. Has Obama (stimulus package, health care, war in Libya) done much to differentiate himself from his predecessor? I can't say that he has. However, we would at least have the possibility of change with a democrat in office. Republicans are called conservatives for a reason.   What our government needs to do is tackle the core issues that no one is willing to address: the poverty gap and incarceration rates. I'll briefly address part of the poverty gap issue by looking at the top money earners in our country.     The extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, enacted by a Democratic-controlled Congress in December with the approval of the Obama administration, pumps $700 billion over the next ten years into the pockets of the rich. Reclaiming two years of that tax windfall would eliminate all of the state budget deficits combined.  Total compensation at Wall Street banks and securities firms last year hit a record $135 billion, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal, on all-time-high revenue of $417 billion. The recipients of the Wall Street bailout could bail out the states out of their own pockets.  The 400 richest individuals in the United States dispose of a staggering $1.37 trillion in assets, an average of nearly $3.5 billion apiece. A levy of 10 percent on the resources of these billionaires would also erase the deficits of all 50 states.  US corporations are currently sitting on $2 trillion in cash, refusing to hire workers despite collecting tax cuts that are supposed to be incentives to do so. A levy of 10 percent on that idle cash would provide enough money to eliminate not only the deficits of the states, but the deficits of all cities and local governments too, as well as preserving the jobs of hundreds of thousands of public employees.  Hedge funds assets rose to $1.92 trillion in 2010, the highest ever, up from $1.18 trillion at the beginning of the year. Given a standard earnings formula of 2 percent of total assets plus 20 percent of the increase, hedge fund bosses stood to collect roughly $186 billion in personal income. An 80 percent tax on that income—less than the percentage rate on multimillionaires levied under the Eisenhower administration—would produce more than enough revenue to put all 50 states in the black. (It should be pointed out that the top hedge fund manager, John Paulson, had a personal net profit of more than $5 billion in 2010, while more than a dozen hedge fund bosses had personal incomes above $2 billion and many more took in over $1 billion).  This is a small portion of the discrepancies. I haven't mentioned the top paid CEOs of the big six health insurance providers. For that information I suggest looking at the Sick for Profit website.   That's why I think we should stick with Obama no matter who opposes him, unless it's someone like Russ Feingold or Bernie Sanders. Then I'd go with Sanders.",1,1

Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Again, no. First of all, 200,000 jobs gained in January are census jobs mostly. Second, the stimulus package contained almost NO stimulus. It CANNOT stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was ""stimulus"" in name only. That aside, we have clearly lost jobs, as unemployment has gone from 6% to 10%. Where did that 700 billion dollars go? And even if we did add jobs, 700 billion for 200k jobs? It would be cheaper to give $1 million dollars to every american.

239,"Alright, I thoguht I'd throe this into the discussion (a logic bomb?), based upon my research I've ascertained that the majority of abortions don't even fall into the argument from sapience.   http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                       facts/after_12_weeks.html    Name your source, they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve (88% to 89% according to each).   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png    This handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10-12.  According to wikipedia, the nervous system begins development around week ten.  So, from all this information, I would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness (no brain) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they can't be aware. In this case I think the remaining 11% to 12% of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed.  I applaud you for a well-reasoned argument, but I had some ideas which weren't considered:   #1   Suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother.  Suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person (as you explained cogently, the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary, at least in a legal sense).  In this case, one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother, who has greater capacity for individuality, thought, and so-forth, right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and isn't yet granted the ""benefit of the doubt"" which the title of personhood confers.   #2   Suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of ""dead"" where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience.  In this case, all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart doesn't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen. It's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood.   #3   Suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus doesn't become a ""baby"" until say, week X (where X is some high week, like between 30 and 36).  In this case, the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion.   #4   This is basically an extended version of #1, but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience, and with high priority.  Suppose we consider the mother's rights as a person to be of paramount importance. These include a right over her body.  In this case, it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system, even if it means that around 1% of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses. We consider their sapience to be less than the woman's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live.  I'd like to address some of what you said:    AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.  BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?   I believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease, is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception. In other words, under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers, that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest, and that test reveals something to be lost. Similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met, and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example, not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer (which technically might disqualify you, but police don't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone).",0,1

425,"Hmmnm.   I have put my views out three (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.

1,"I do not have a whole locing family, I am a fosetr kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?

That is also what you liberals would call an ""arbitrary"" or ""capricious"" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should ""get their own thing"". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and ""new"" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G ""Great"" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts.

We have laws against playing music too loud, but because people do it anyway, should we make playing music illegal?  Yes marijuana would be cheaper if legalized, you do not understand the way a black market works. Because the people growing, trafficking, and selling marijuana have to take huge risks, they make the price higher. Once legalized the price would lower. So your argument that there would be a blackmarket with cheaper prices is invalid.  Really the last thing we need as a country is more people doing marijuana? I can think of far worse things. Assuming that legalizing it would significantly increase use long term, which you don't have evidence for, what is the big deal? People do not end up at rehab for marijuana. It is not addictive. If they go to rehab it is because they have addictive personalities and are using it too much because of that, not because it is addicting. People with addictive personalities can need help for anything. Out of curiosity would you have slapped Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they created apple while smoking marijuana.

177,"What does it mean to habe gay marrigaes legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.",1,0

You're assuming to know  ""the real reason""  why some heterosexuals don't want to allow homosexuals to use the word marriage. Heterosexuals say that the reason they don't want gays to marry is because marriage has traditionally been a union between a man and a woman. You seem to be calling these heterosexuals liars and racists who consider gays to be subhuman.  So, to recap, your argument is based on discrediting me by calling me naive and appealing to the reader's emotions by insinuating that heterosexuals are racists. I tend to find these types of arguments as weak. I mean, name calling and trying to manipulate people's emotions instead of letting your argument stand alone on its merit is weak.

I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion.   According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.    I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in  literally  every post since the issue came up. If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.   Abortion is legal.  Murder is not legal.  Therefor, legally, abortion cannot be murder.   And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus.    I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability.    Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself.

I am referring to the specific zygote that results from the fertilization event after intercourse, between two human beings.   So artificially inseminated women can get abortions and clones can be aborted now. Where's your irrational bleeding heart now?   I'm not talking about an animal or genetically engineered cells or whatever crazy outlandish example that you keep pulling out of your arse.   This isn't 1950, and medical science isn't like the old Frankenstein movies of the old days. Mammalian cloning has been done many times in the past, and cell biology is a maturing science that allows the techniques I disclosed as a matter of common practice. Human cloning isn't special, it's just presently illegal.   Correction: fully grown humans are defined by that. Those humans had to go through a growing stage before they gained all of the abilities that you mentioned. During that growth, they are not fully grown but are still human life.   Again wrong. Babies and toddlers have a very simple capacity to reason, think and grow. This is afterall why they can learn language and our culture.   I am not concerned with it because the premise of my argument is indifferent with relation to the law. I am strictly dealing with morality. It use to be legal to own people. Thank goodness people didn't take the position that you are taking.   Oh yes, I remember slavery. Back in those days the Negroes were considered inferior creations, descended from god's disfavoured, cast-away people. It was thought that our moral duty was to own them because we could elevate them from their primitive culture and bring them some form of civilisation. To do otherwise, to let them have ownership of their own bodies was considered the same as allowing them to return to laziness and unproductivity.  Just another one of history's great examples of what happens when morals are imposed upon people without their consent for their greater good.   You still have failed to disprove what I said. We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware. The exact moment of self-awareness is extremely important if you want to prove your argument, but you simply cannot do so. You wrote a check that your mind couldn't cash.   I thought it was obvious, but I'll try again since you seem to need help here:  At what point does a fetus respond to stimuli? At what point toes it show signs of memory? At what point does it have a central nervous system? Answer all three questions and you have a reasonable cut-off period for abortions, or at least a decent argument for one.   Sure it matters. One method is natural and another method is unnatural. I don't advocate human cloning either, even though that could result in more human life.   I'll repeat myself: unnatural versus natural means squat. Find a logical distinction, and don't rely purely on what feels good.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy   Your argument to my point that all cells have the potential for life as a fetus does, is something like ""but it's not natural!!!""   http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html  (checkmate)  I never said anything about the zygote having a soul. My position is that it is human life, therefore to end that life at any point should be considered murder.    You might want to do more research.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction    http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/                                      3500603.html     http://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm    In other words, PBA (Intact dilation and extraction) accounts for under 1% of abortions as of 2000, and about 5% as of 2003.  In other words your argument that babies' brains are being sucked out is a peripheral one that does not cover the main issue: the vast majority of abortions don't abort fetuses with brains, but instead embryos.   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png     I'm not concerned with you bizarre hypothetical that completely ignores that basis of which we have been debating on. At no point did I say sperm or a woman's eggs were human life. The conjoining of the 2 in a fertilization event which results in a zygote is human life. (Naturally through intercourse)   Your argument that embryos and fetuses are human lives is as absurd as my ""bizarre hypothetical"" and what's more your position is backed almost exclusively by religious agenda and not reason, again like my ""bizarre example.""  I have a question for you: if you care so deeply about embryos and young fetuses being aborted (the vast majority of abortions fall under this, after all) why aren't you setting up adoption centres that give money to couples who choose to have the child instead of abort it? Why aren't you donating time and effort to foster services? Why aren't you looking for research teams, or developing research teams to find ways to emulate a uterus for incubating embryos?  In other words at the moment you're just being an opinionated jackoff who isn't DOING anything to help the situation. You have a feeling, an opinion that somehow an embryo deserves equal rights as a human being, but you're not showing an inkling of care for the women that must suffer if your opinion had any weight.   And I ridicule you and everyone who thinks like you do. You inject new, fabricated, unrealistic hypotheticals into the debate and expect it to make sense. You can try to justify abortion all you want by bringing animals and artificial matters into the discussion but it is painfully obvious that you are searching frantically for an excuse to allow the taking of innocent human life.   I expect it to make sense because I figured that you had the intelligence to imagine your argument taken to its logical extremes. I don't have to wring my hands and sweat over the treatment of fetuses, zygotes and embryos as less than human because I genuinely do not feel anything towards them. Your attempts to elicit emotion by conflating fetuses with infants also does nothing to me because I feel no emotion towards them either. We may as well be discussing the building of a fence.",0,1

It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept.

My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops. How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current ""all or nothing"" one that is all too common.",1,1

393,"""Please tell me why you are the authoritt on which 'killnigs' are okay, and which are not.""  First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion. Instead, what I did was set out generic examples on why abortion should be acceptable and unacceptable. If we were to debate about specific cases, there would be no end to possibilities that we could conjure. And secondly, I never wrote that 'killings were okay', I used the word acceptable throughout my point, and that brings a different weightage and seriousness to the issue. Not just one where, it is ""okay"" or ""not okay"" as if we were picking vegetables at a supermarket.  ""Abortion is a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'? ""  I never implied that abortion is a painless process, it is a very physically and emotionally painful process that may scar one for life. But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'. Instead, they should face up to what they have did and actually consider about raising the life that they created and not kill it simply because they just wanted the pleasure of sex at the point and nothing else. Of course I'm generalizing here by saying that teenagers are irresponsible people, but truth be told, many teenagers choose abortion as the easy way out, when actually they might be able to raise a child with the support of their families. How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned? Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners? If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.   ""It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.  Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.""  I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance. And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place would she? Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.",1,0

554,"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree wuth you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed.   Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing.   Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation.   Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption.",1,1

377,"What? wnding a lfie isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",0,0

594,"Yes we csn!"" roared the crowd. It was an emotinoal night for everyone. The 2008 presidential election was over. John McCain had lost to the first major party endorsed African-American presidential candidate in United States history. We finally closed troubling chapters in our history such as Mississippi burning and the civil rights marches of Selma.  Republicans, including the bewildered Religious Right, sat stunned in their seats wondering what would happen to their country. It was not because the Democratic Party was any different from the Bush Administration but because the GOP had pathetically lost its neo-conservative bully pulpit in the White House.  Democrats cheered with glee at the opportunity to take back the power that was theirs during the Clinton Glory Days. They salivated at the prospect of re-introducing neo-liberal interventionism on foreign soil and overseas markets They longed to once again crank the Dollar presses to inflate the money supply in the name of the ""poor"" this time instead of ""business"". They would gladly finish the work of the Fall of the American Empire started under the Bush Regime.  And now, the smoke and mirrors game goes on. The crooked politicians of 2009 are no different than the corrupt politicians of the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties. Crony capitalists like oil barons and railway tycoons then lined the pockets of our nation's representatives to further the goals of Big Business and destroy the wealth of American workers. Sound familiar?  President Obama had a unique opportunity in history -- and he blew it. He brought us ""change"" indeed. He slammed the Bush Doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper-drive. The rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism.  If there is one thing Americans say about Obama it is this: he cares.  He cares for the mechanic in Detroit who lost his job. He cares for the middle-aged couple living in the Hooverville tent outside Sacramento. He cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in Toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored.  But does Obama really care?  In fact, his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old Ronald Reagan playbook we knew as trickle-down economics. These days the compassionate White House grants bail-out money to financial monsters like AIG and Bank of America. There could be no better help for the American veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just aren't any more jobs. (Unless of course, you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening.) The idea is that bail-out money will sooner or later trickle-down to the great unwashed masses of Americans wondering what in Sam Hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts.  It may only be a drop of financial bail-out -- but hey it trickled down. Next up, bread lines!  The truth is that the White House allowed corporate giant CEOs to loot and pilfer the public treasury. This Administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from Baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at Guantanamo Bay.  The left-right political paradigm in this country is a sham. (Sorry to disappoint my fellow Evangelical Christians.) Both parties have proven to be Big Business, Big Government warmongers. For those who actually wished McCain had been elected just think about this: the GOP would have put up no opposition to the new President's Stimulus Package and would have rammed through trillions more in ""help"" for America.  So there you have it. President Obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal -- and all with a smile.  How is the left-right scenario a sham? Consider the following.  The gay rights issue is a political distraction. Stem cell research? Just more Big Research pork-barrel spending. Abortion? It's the political Gordian Knot that requires even the most astute of political science majors to bust a gut if they dare try to untie it. The so-called immigration invasion? A typical act of sensational yellow journalism that says, ""Look over there, Bubba! It ain't your own government stealin' your hard-earned dollars, it's them Mexicans lookin' for revenge and dishwasher jobs since the Alamo!"" Sorry, Pat Buchanan, the ""Death of the West"" comes from the corruption in our government, not the immigrants heading back home in record numbers.  What are the real issues of post-election America? For starters, the destruction of individual wealth in this country, save for the high upper class. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the Great Depression and will take decades to recover. There is no need for a conspiracy theory here -- only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves.  We must not waste time. We must move our already-compromised and over-valued U.S. Dollars into assets of real value. This does not include real estate unless you're buying ten cents or less on the high-priced dollar. Forget your 401(k), pensions and your annuities. Unless you can take your money out, they are toast. The stock market is one toxic graveyard, particularly finance shares. Dump them. Invest in precious metals, food supply, cigarettes, alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the Dollar collapses.  Consider buying silver, palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex.com. I personally recommend silverbullion.com because I support the goals of the owner Jason Hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange. Remember, that despite the U.S. Treasury's naked assertions, the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves the right of individual States to mint legal tender coins so long as they're gold or silver.  When the dollar collapses, I do not think that New York City will burn or that the United States will come to an immediate end. But if it did, the blame must rest entirely on Barack Obama and his Congressional Criminal Syndicate.  Some might here criticize me as being unfair. After all, George W. Bush The Evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars, his blatant lies to stir Americans to bloodshed, his deliberate obstruction to the 9/11 Commission, his last-minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions, his economic tinkering with interest rates, his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children, his doubling of the national debt, et cetera, et cetera.  But let me be clear about this. George W. Bush is a public menace. He and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes. But that will never happen under an Obama Presidency, in spite of the President's left-leaning brand of crony capitalism. The Truth Commission currently at play in the Congress is merely a circus show to fool Americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture, invasion, occupation, mayhem, pillaging, looting, rape, pollution, perjury, bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war.  Every moment that the Obama Administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former Administration, it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new President has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his Democratic base and the American voter. The White House today has continued in the same deadly bait-and-switch tactics of the former Village Idiot-In-Chief. Additionally, Obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the ""War and Bankers Party"" on both sides of the aisle.  For a President to vociferously take on Rush Limbaugh the GOP's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal. Besides the fact that the Democrats want to point out the weakness of the GOP's leadership vacuum, Obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution in light of the economic crisis. Are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian Hugo Chavez, who is a regular media personality, cheer Obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries?  Evangelical Christian radio stations are scared stiff about the Democratic-led Congress reviving restrictions on Americans to share their religious opinions over the people's airwaves. And they should be concerned. (I particularly enjoy my local station.) After all, the same kind of government that monitors, censors, filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals, plunders and coerces its own people. One look at China's control of the internet and Google's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian's skin crawl. Reports that Australia is considering Chinese-style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves.  So why is President Obama responsible for our economic debacle?  Because it's the first rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. If he didn't like the prospect of being stuck with the mess of his predecessor he should have remained in the Senate or considered an honest living like working for AIG or Lehmann Brothers. Obama has not only repeated the same unconstitutional trespasses of Bush II, but he actually increased the amount of corporate welfare to the Bank Barons. Obama turned a blind eye to the Federal Reserve's arbitrary usury practice through the printing of increasingly worthless U.S. Dollars.  Are we really going to see a Dow Jones 4000? The answer is regrettably yes -- and then some. There are economic forces at play that will no longer be ignored or manipulated. Human behavior will always gravitate towards self-preservation and the protection of our future generations through wealth-building, capital, production and labor. All the paper fiat money and government spending in the world can never stop that or help this economic disaster recover without drastic corrections to our own cursed speculative market. The times of fast and easy money are over.  President Obama has not even finished his first year in office and I must already call him out as one of the worst Executives ever in the history of our Republic. Bush II is close behind. Every GOP and Democratic elected leader that voted for any of these crooked bail-outs deserves a one-way ticket to an electoral defeat. Should state law allow it, a public tar-and-feathering might be in order.  When our country faced economic dangers, depressionary woes and international volatility let it be said that President Obama failed to protect us from the corruption of Congress, the indifference of the Judiciary and the foolishness of the People. Let it be said that he abandoned his post to uphold the Constitution. Let it be said that he whored his policies and his office for the rich and powerful, both foreign and domestic. Let it be said that we voted for change and all we got was the Raw Deal of the Obama Failure obama is a failure",1,0

577,"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are noral agents, moral agetns are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",0,1

Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep? after all you will eventually demonstrate sapience when you wake up, which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience. well sleeping your moments are similar to the kicking a fetus may have, they are not a demonstration of sapience. The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?    If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation.

Human neings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",0,1

If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry.

However, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why Clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus.   My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me.   You're ignoring some of my points on a voucher program, but even so, it makes little sense to reward others for doing nothing. As well, as explained, government services provide a lot less to the public than private services. This is simply because pursuit of wealth increases overall wealth. People have more in Capitalistic countries than in Collectivist countries. This is what the USSR witnessed when they privatized more industries, and this was the BIGGEST realization for China as they went from Communist to practically Laissez-Faire economics.     Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality.   Socialistic policies do not increase the amount of goods and services available to people (unless you include Militaristic policies that have been the only historical instance where massive government spending has actually benefited the citizens in in their wants). Food and clean water supply goes up with private industries' efforts to make more money. Consumers want goods and services, private forces provide them.  If you're worried about the poor, a voucher program (that would cut down spending and regulation greatly) would benefit them far more than a public service. Vouchers would give them the ability to choose at little to no cost to themselves. However, socialistic policies of government services and regulation only make things harder for the poor.   Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   I've given my explanation on Scandanavia and PrayerFails has given a different but also effective one as well. Wealth equality doesn't mean jack shit if the overall wealth is still low.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform   The current Ryan plan is to appeal to the Mainstream Democrats who hated his voucher program for healthcare.   over-regulation is one of them   general regulation does this. Unless you mean regulation ONLY in rich neighborhoods...    The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.   It came from government incentives to ""look out for the poor"" who were actually the risky loans. It came from government taxes on businesses that didn't make these high risks.    Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   I feel that you completely ignored my points that regulators should have no say in any of the business of the banks, and that general government should give absolutely no rewards to banks for any reasons. No subsidies, no tax incentives, no regulation, no interest fondling, and no bail-outs. Government should view banks as another business and should have no concern for them. This will remove their power over all of us who depend greatly on government currency yet require private industries to provide us with this government provision.   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   Explain.   I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately.   Why? forgive me, but this may just be my issue with debate in general, when others look to their pastors and school teachers as experts on very complex issues (especially to justify the surrendering of liberty for the sake of security that has never been shown to exist or be successful).   but the commentary they provide is not worthless.

I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals.""     Point two: Just because someone wants something doesn't mean that they are entitled to it. So, no matter how noble gays may be, no matter how important the word is to them, they are not entitled to it.  Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word. But trying to force someone into doing something they don't want usually results in them resisting with equal or greater force.  I thus propose that gays create a new word and stop this ""war.""",0,1
565,"Why woukd anyone chop you to pieces for ptuting up a well written rebuttal? Is it me you fear?  I've heard of people trying to repress their desire to be with their own sex but I don't know how they could possibly know about their hormones! Many Catholics have tried to do what the church says is right to do...some have failed and some have not, on some level. Look at it this way for a moment. You're straight...you were born that way. 90% of the rest of the world is gay because they were born that way. Could I or anyone convince you, or would you be happy if someone were to try and change you into being gay? I don't think that would be possible, do you?  It's also interesting to me that the churches have softened their views of this too. Not the Catholic church but others. Some even ordain gay people into the priesthood or the ministry. That tells me something has changed through the years. Could it be the medical findings of all those poor dead people who succumbed to AIDS that changed their minds? It certainly would mine or at the very least, re-think it. If people are born this way, how can they help what they were born to be?",1,1
476,"You are assuming from a Christian article taht evetyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will. Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God. No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world. It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity. You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin. You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible. I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type.

108,"Unborn babies are living thingd and when you kill tehm, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13.   Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods.

Hmm, lets see...You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with ""go check the Bible."" I'm still waiting for the evidence. I ask two simple questions. What did Jesus say about abortions? What is right and wrong according to Jesus? I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me.  We are all lawbreakers. So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other? God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS. A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies. Why are you trying to deny it? You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS. ""Go get your Bible"" if you think I am wrong.   I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic. We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion. I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with. I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason. The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion. Obviously it is a human being imo. Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic. Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?",1,0
156,"I appecuate the support and msut admit that I had been debating back and forth with hellno and initially thought your response was from him so I may have been harsher than I would have been otherwise. Sorry for that, but hopefully I can clear up the FFC thing with this post.   FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states   this is where you are mistaken - the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state including saying that a law passed in one state has no effect on another state (DOMA).  The reason DOMA might be unconstitutional is not the FFC, it is the equal protection clause.

519,"You do'nt need a piece of paper to dedine your happiness. However, you do need a piece of paper -- and be straight -- to be eligible for the considerable financial benefits given to married people. Same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.  When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benefits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marriage be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way toward same sex couples.

288,"I wrote a paper a few years bavk on this topic and I can tlel you that everything you state here has no validity. Don't get me wrong, it has points that many make but there are plenty of studies out there that will put you at ease.  First, I would recommend you do a little research on childhood psychology.   Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad.   Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed.   One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School). Growing up in a small town almost entirely made up of white republican Catholics, I was abnormal; I knew I was different. Guess what, I'm doing just fine.
