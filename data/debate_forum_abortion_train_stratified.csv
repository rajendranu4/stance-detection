"Birth control is not 100 percent effective; one of my coworkers was on birth control and conceived. Now she is a proud mother.   Conceiving while on birth control isn't always due to incorrect application or use of the birth control, sometimes a person just falls into that .01 percent where the birth control failed to do what it was meant to. In that sense, considering a person taking it who didn't intend on having a baby and the birth control failed, I would support her if she decided to have an abortion.  And who's to say those who are allergic to certain types of birth control aren't already considering the possibility of conceiving? Would thinking ""of the consequences before... sex"" justify a person’s decision if they conceived and wanted an abortion? If not then why even bring that up?",1
Okay...  --------------------------------------- -------------------------,1
"I agree completely ! And abortion doesn't make you ""unpregnant"". It just makes you the mother of a dead baby !",0
"You're not bringing any new arguments to the table, so stop spamming!",1
"Yes, There is no shame, women fail to carry a fetus to term more often than not without artificially inducing rejection, medical abortion only artificially induces this natural process, the artificiality of inducing this seems like it has no more moral significance than it occuring naturally. This is because the fetus doesnt develp consciousness until the onset of the third trimester - prior to this point (more than ~99% of all abortions occure in the 1st trimester) there is no moral status to the actions taken with regards to the preservation of the fetus. This is true for surgical abortions too since they also occure during the first trimester.   The morality of abortion has to do with the freedom to have them, not the act of doing them, since the act of doing them is for all reasonable accounts an a-moral action. It should be everyone's right to have an abortion because people should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.",1
"FINING UNPROTECTED SEX?  So what? Do you plan on having the Government check every couple for a condom in the middle of it all?  That is a serious invasion of privacy.  The system would not work. Simple.  The concept of jail-time is just ridiculous, surely you must even see how ridiculous that actually is.",0
"Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.  That is NOT my reasoning. I have some tests coming up so i won't respond immediately perhaps this weekend I'll write something up summarizing my position. Responding and not stating may of lead to confusion. My responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making, not a argument for or against abortion themselves. Instead of being reactive I'll be active, so far this debate has been very helpful. i think i can now put explicitly my objections but i won't have time to make sure their elegant, concise etc till the weekend. I likely won't get on this website till then, or Friday.",0
"What you on about? LOL you actually make laugh  God loves killing babies?  If God loved killing babies would you not be dead?  God loves children you fool.  Your just an idiotic athiest who doesnt even know what he's talking about.     Have you ever read the bible? The biblical god has smote children on more than one occasion. The common examples are the flood (children were among those to be drowned), and the first-born of Egypt (as if a first-born child has any idea of what's going on at that age, and deserves death). Then there are battles in which the god-approved side was given the approval (blessing) to kill everyone in the opposing side, including sacking their cities, and their women and children. Also, do not forget that a kid who is disrespectful towards his or her parents is to be put to death.",1
"Adoption is not an alternative to abortion, because it remains the woman's choice whether or not to give her child up for adoption. Statistics show that very few women who give birth choose to give up their babies - less than 3% of white unmarried women and less than 2% of black unmarried women.",1
"Abortion is horrible. It disgusts me. Why are people so selfish that they would take a life? Does no one care about the miracle of life anymore? Even if a person doesn't want the baby, put it up for adoption! There are many women who are barren, and this give that child, not ""Fetus"", but PERSON a chance!",0
"The reason I'm breaking it all down for all you pro-life people is that YOU ALL feel the need to project YOUR GUILT on others who has the view that they're not killing a person! It's your guilt, not others'. Feel it yourself! Go to confession if you're Catholic. Do whatever you need to do.  You all keep telling us that it's murder! I can safely say that about 9/10 arguments found on here are based upon that ONE SINGLE point, which may I add is completely incorrect! It's how we see it. If you don't like that, then we pity you. Just don't force your view on us and then try to push for a law that govern our lives too!  Reproduction means the world to the human race? What about unchecked reproduction like in China and India where the one child policy has created more problems and actual murders then is necessary?  We all agree that at the end of the 9 months it's an actual human life. I actually made the point that at week 20 it has a slight chance of survival and should be saved, as society can now intervene.",1
"All of us were once a fetus. That is a child. Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video, silent screams? Or how about the facts about a 10 week fetus.   The whole argument is whether it is a person or not. Just because the law says it not, does not make that right. We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right.",0
Paying high taxes ios a lesser evil than tolerating the murder of unborn children.   But I agree with you about sex education and birth controil.,0
"Any creature with a nervous system has ""feelings"", what I am referring to are thoughts and emotions.   Are you saying that a new born does not have thoughts and/or emotions?   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.   I did not say that the fetus is not a Homo sapien. No fair minded person will accuse me of saying such a thing.   Thus killing a human being.   So? You have not shown that this is morally wrong in any way.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of ""parasite"" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?   I said that fetuses are parasites. But I did  not  say that they are not Homo sapien. Get your facts right. For example, a tick can both be considered an arthropod and a parasite.  In any case, you still haven't shown that abortion is morally wrong.",1
Only for women who's lives are in danger and the baby is too young to survive.,1
"Contrary to popular belief Roe v. Wade never legalized abortion. It stated that until the fetus became viable to live on it's own if it was taken out of the woman that her right to privacy outweighed the state's interest in the protection of life. It also stated that until the child is born it is in effect outside the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore NOT entitled to protections offered to citizens of the United States. The only protection that could be offered to the fetus was in a manner that servered the state's intrest while protection the privacy of the woman. (in other words the fetus had no rights and the ablity of the state to interfer with pregenacy was limited in the absolute extreme)  By legalizing abortion you are, in effect, giving the government jurisdiction inside your body. I for one think that government has no right inside a person's body.  Keep the current rule that abortion is neither legal nor illegal becuase it's outside the juristiction of the goverment. Keep a person's body soverign to themselfs only.",0
"If someone got aborted, they wouldn't be around to like it or not. They would have been terminated before they developed a consciousness.   Also, the 'choice' is in pro-choice for a reason. It's fine to for a mother to chose to keep a baby, if she wants to.",1
An old man? You can't be much passed 55 by now.  ........................,0
"Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life.   For it has nothing to be innocent of, it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus.   A fetus is a parasite, living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed. Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life.",1
"A fetus is NOT a human, just a mass﻿ of tissue  Abortion is safer than childbirth  The number of abortions are relatively small  Nobody has the right to impose their morals on others  A woman should be able to control her own body  Abortion must be kept legal, especially for all the rape and incest pregnancies  If abortion is outlawed women will be forced to go to back-alley abortion clinics  Aborting an unwanted fetus reduces the number of abused children",1
Yea abortion should be legal!!!!!!! Even though i do not like the thought of innocent babies being killed for no reason at all. I would much rather see that happen then having children being starved and abused and neglected!,1
"A women should be able to choose what happens with her body, especially concerning abortion and babies.  Not because I support abortion, but what if you were the child of a mom?  What if that mom only had you grudgingly because she was forced to have you, abortions being outlawed?  Would you really want to grow up unloved? A child who's own mother would have aborted you?   Worse than an accident, you are a person whom the people you are supposed to love, and are supposed to love you would rather have had you dead than given birth to you.  In reality, it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel, and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more? Why go to the trouble and the pain for the mother, and the child, the entire family, and the whole world, when abortion could be an option?  I support safe sex and planned pregnancy, I think abortion is murder, as is war or any human killing another human, but killing does happen. Every time you eat, you are eating something that was killed, plant or animal.  If it reduces pain in the world, then you should be able to abort.",1
Abortion should not be legal because if we could just get rid of abortion we could get save some of our and your tax dollars that pay for abortion and plus seeing as my tax dollars pay for someone to have an abortion or murder the child its like im helping the person kill the child as are all of us medical neccesity is fine but as far as im concerned i dont think i should have to pay for someone to kill their kid,0
But it is growing into a human being? Am i right or wrong? You should understand that these cells are different from the other cells within our body. Cells that are developing with it's own genetic uniqueness and has its own DNA and blood type. Then why do the laws protects that very mass of cells by recognizing the homicide of a fetus as a separate offense if it is unworthy of human rights according to you?  Well that case i am referring to has a lot to do with this debate because it is a dispute on whether or not life begins at conception and it is a scientific controversy which resulted in the court ruling that life begins at conception after hearing arguments from both sides. So does a person who has Alzheimer is also not self aware which is why they are described as being in the baby stage? Well let us consider adoption instead of abortion and stop making it seem as if abortion is the only way out. Who is responsible for bringing them into existence? Did they asked to be brought into existence or to be related?,0
"But it sure as hell wouldn't be spinning for you.   So what?  You're avoiding the fundamental question.   Why is it wrong to destroy potential life?   I sit here with an open mind, ready to consider your answer. Or do you not have a logically coherent answer?",1
"Month one  Mommy  I am only 8 inches long  but I have all my organs.  I love the sound of your voice.  Every time I hear it  I wave my arms and legs.  The sound of your heart beat  is my favorite lullaby.  Month Two  Mommy  today I learned how to suck my thumb.  If you could see me  you could definitely tell that I am a baby.  I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.  It is so nice and warm in here.  Month Three  You know what Mommy  I'm a boy / girl!  I hope that makes you happy.  I always want you to be happy.  I don't like it when you cry.  You sound so sad.  It makes me sad too  and I cry with you even though  you can't hear me.  Month Four  Mommy  my hair is starting to grow.  It is very short and fine, but i will have a lot of it  I spend a lot of my time exercising.  I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes  and stretch my arms and legs.  I am becoming quite good at it too.  Month Five  You went to the doctor today.  Mommy, he lied to you.  He said that I'm not a baby.  I am a baby Mommy, your baby.  I think and feel.  Mommy, what's abortion?  Month Six  I can hear that doctor again.  I don't like him.  He seems cold and heartless.  Something is intruding my home.  The doctor called it a needle.  Mommy what is it? It burns!  Please make him stop!  I can't get away from it!  Mommy! HELP me!  Month Seven  Mommy  I am okay.  I am in Death's arms.  He is holding me.  He told me about abortion.  Why didn't you want me Mommy?  Every Abortion Is Just . . .  One more heart that was stopped.  Two more eyes that will never see.  Two more hands that will never touch.  Two more legs that will never run.  One more mouth that will never speak.  Did you know that by day 30 you had a heart?  Did you know that by day 42 that that your brain ordered your heart to start beating if it hadn't given the order already?  I bet that you didn't know that if there is brain activity doctors consider a patient alive and has the right to continue living  Life starts at the moment of conception and abortion is therefore immoral, wrong and a waste of time",0
"Not only,let's think about what happens to unwanted children when they come into this world.Yes,some of them end up being loved and cherished,but a mother who loses her job and her partner and her emotional sanity because of the child will ALWAYS ressent that child,deep down,and then the child will go throughtout hearing the old ""Look at all the sacrifices I've done for you!"" thing.Not to mention,what about the children whose parents are alcholics,drug addicts,abusers,violent,severely mentally ill?These are the children that end up in the hospital five years later completely destroyed,emotionally and physically,these are the children that are already living in violence and terror before they were even born.This is a controversial statement but sometimes NOT chosing abortion should even be a crime.",1

"Why would you ever describe a human as a parasite. Apparently we are nothing but   but a bunch of disease ridden single celled organisms. First of all we cannot be parasites because we are multi-cellular organisms, an unborn baby is still a human, it is okay if it dies by natural causes but on purpose to kill it is just wrong.",0
"Abortion should be legal. The government should never have the right to make decisions pertaining to one's own body and/or a decision to bring a child into the world or not. It takes the moral responsibility to do what is right away from the individual and this would cause us to become more and more conditioned to behave in whatever ways the establishment chooses to mold us. It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.  If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption? In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year. Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become ""baby merchants"", for profit. An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs. What moral ground does that hold? Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty.   To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.  I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance. If we want to prosper as a nation we have to believe in our fellow man and that he will do what's right, however, that faith will not come without regulations to protect the system from those of us that would abuse it.",1
"At a genetic level, they are humans. I guess that's the closest we've come to scientific evidence in either direction. DNA from a fetus, looks no different that that of an adult.

"It has nothing to do my with my  approval . I'm using negative circumstance as an example as to why a woman might abort.  Not a few weeks earlier I do believe the youngest was 22 weeks. I'm not arguing that, which leads me to believe you DO NOT read the arguments people make! I think the latest gestation for abortion should be lowered.  Here you go Mr. Science.  Most scientists agree that pain is experienced in the cortical areas of the brain, which do not develop until the second trimester. Painful experiences result in autonomic (they occur automatically during pain) physiologic changes that can be measured. For example, when we fell pain, our bodies produce endorphins and cortisol to help deal with the pain. One study was conducted on fetuses during blood draws. This study showed elevated fetal plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin response to intrauterine needling early in the second trimester but not before.  So the first trimester is an ideal time for abortion which is when most occur anyway. It's extended mostly for medical reasons as some deformities and disabilities cannot be detected until the second trimester which is a time I will agree the woman has a right to an abortion in the second trimester. Answered now?",0
"kmac and princessjess are right abortion is murder. if you feel that you cant take care of the child, adoption is an option. there are families in this world that can not have children. why not give the baby to them so it can be happy and have a good life. there is nothing wrong with adoption",0
Right now you are the one who cannot comprehend this.   As of right now abortion is legal. Other people though do not agree (like me) that abortion SHOULD be legal. Murder is an unlawful killing.

"If you were not taught how to put a condom on, in any years of high schooling, then one of your teachers are applicable to be the victim of a law-suit. If you performed sexual activity with your spouse and got her pregnant, you could make allot of money from one of teachers.   Learning how to put a condom is the entire essence of reducing teen pregnancy and STD's. If safe-sex is performed by teenagers, then it is a non-contributing factor to pregnancy.    "" But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex; they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.""   Well... yes, it does help. You make the basis of this argument with the fact that teenagers are still engrossed in having sex, but what you fail to realize is that education has taught them how to enact safe-sexual procedures decreasing there chance of becoming pregnant. No one argues about teen sexual activity as it is irrelevant if they are doing under the influence of protection.    ""they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate.""   How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate. Especially when this is all under the influence of safe-sex, you have no basis to say that sex is wrong outside these variables of yours.    ""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""   Funny that, it sounds as if you read all of it and didn't have anything easy to rebut so you ignored it in your next dispute. Also if you read it properly without such a bias opinion you would be less inclined to be falsely prophesizing your point of view in a spurious fashion. Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that""  -""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  -""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays” ROFL WTF?!  And now,  -""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""",1

The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....  I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.  I believe in free speech...so I am going to address and comment on the things you say here in the most honest way possible. Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close. They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb. Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated? Maybe you do I don't know. Your worldview is simply one of the coldest I have seen.   Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.  Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone.   Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share.   Studies show that what I am saying is true. If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over.  Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education? LOL Could you site that study would love to read it.  The fact is Guttmaucher says this...which does not make sense with what you are saying.  ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.""  "" Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24%.""  Now this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.    ""About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  This group is not going to school....most likely because they have multiple children at home. And if they are going for multiple abortion using it as birth control, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion.  "" Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children).""  Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up? LOL  Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically.

Recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons, but i find it tedious here. Now I've already answered this but i'll gladly do it again: Killing a grown kid is murder! Why did society make a law to try and stop murders? Because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing! Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species. Don't believe me? Thou shall not kill... thou shall not steal... thou shall honour thy parents... etc... all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species.  Now, a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development, which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high. That kid has earned its right to be a part of society. Killing that kid is wrong. A fetus on the other hand, can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too. The point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership. This is the way it should be. Maybe one day, we'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what? I bet there'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal! That's why societies make law. If it has nothing to do with the survival of society, society should stay out of it.",1

I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.   Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue. By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child. So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.  Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference. We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion. Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.  In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is the  biggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!  Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands. And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that is  just plain stupid . The Government  can  have a say in education, but they  cannot  examine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex. It would be a full time job with prostitutes.

"That scenario of the endangered mother is rare. The vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children. You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.  The right to life is  the  most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue. When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.  In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion. And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust. I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.  In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.  This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere. This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I. Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.      Just consider that 1/3 of our population has been exterminated since Roe vs Wade.

If you have the audacity to claim that, I would say that you have less knowledge of Geography that my 5 year old nephew.   How does human not equal homo sapien?   I don't believe that was what I said. Homo sapien is a species of animals. To be human, one must also possess personhood. According to Dr. Mianna Lotz from the Centre of Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, whom I've had the pleasure to meet recently, ""Personhood is generally defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.""   I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   Conversely, even when the effect of an action is fatal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action itself was wrong.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.   That is an extremely feeble argument. How can someone ignore unforeseen circumstances?",1

"I think that referring to mathematical rules as ""laws"" is the kind of misleading argument religious people like to use when implying that when using mathematics you require faith. Mathematics are not the ultimate truth about anything, neither should they be treated as unchangeable laws of the universe. Mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, etc. are a set of tools invented by humans in order to explain phenomena we observe around us. We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.  Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life. My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us. This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.  Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one...   ""1 is not 4""   Wrong, this is not always the case. When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4. In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system).",1

We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware.

"The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.   You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.  For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.  For the rest of us, I suppose that holding a person's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature, is frankly ghastly.   The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.   Just to set the record straight, I have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis. Quite frankly, the newborn brain is still simple enough that I see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason. I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   Creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us. Further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother, since it is her body, and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind.   Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.  Have you ever seen a foetus?",1
I only support abortion if the mothers life is in danger and if the fetus is young. And if the baby is deformed but if it is for no good reason then I don't support it.,0
"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.   Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.   Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.   Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.   Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.   My own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion!!",0
"TO ALL PRO-LIFE SUPPORTERS OUT THERE  Well, of course, I would be very happy if an anti-abortion law was passed...on one condition. Since we passed an anti-abortion law, why don't we pass a law similar to, say, the  buddy system . This way, all pro-life supporters who really really really wanted to take away the rights of Americans should have to pay 118,590 dollars over 18 years (average expenditures for a child in a low-income single-parent home). I'm sure when they are finally frustrated with paying for that child  unnecessarily  (like a mother who could have had an abortion), the pro-life supporters will stop denying the rights of others.  Because, you see, not all Americans are as rich as you are and many can't afford one or more child to take care of, especially teenage mothers. Forcing a mother to have a baby will, in most cases, exacerbate the economic conditions and welfare of the child as well as the parent(s).",1
"No, I disagree.  There is no right time to have an abortion.",0
"It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed. A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference. I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.  About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.  about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.  Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems. And perfection is never a requirement for law. it's meant to reduce the numbers. Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will.",0
"You need a better interpreter then me but i will give it my best. Jesus here is speaking that the Old Testament was speaking of his coming.

I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who …DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB. This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention…standing up and saying…."" I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill."" They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice…they want the same thing….legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skin….compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb…..you think is the same thing? Laughable…won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being….hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you life…and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers…to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan said…it was so true.  “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”  Question….I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women….to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quote….""I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.""  What is wrong with owning the label? You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion? Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?  If there is…then why do you support it? If there isn't…why isn't the label ok?   LOL",0
"Why are you bringing religion into this. Lets debate this from a scientific point of view. Tell me what science says about it.   You always know when someone loses it... they start swearing. Why should you be taken seriously when your potty mouth speaks more than the content of what you are saying? Shows a lack of knowledge and class.   And by the way....who says God causes miscarriages? Can't they be an act of nature? You hate God/idea of God so much that you can't even control your emotions. LOL  Jesus does not perform abortions. The woman walks in on her own, hires someone to kill the living human being inside her....that is an abortion. This is not a miscarriage.   Your so empty....",0
"Of course it should be banned. Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation. At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life. But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion. It equals genocide - on a massive, massive scale. My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.",0
"Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like. I merely countered your argument. So in reality  your  central theme seems to be sex.   I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution.   This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad.   It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that.   Furthermore, you entirely ignored my desire to quit debating non-abortion related issues within this debate. If you'd like to debate some other topic, let's start a new debate. (please and thank you)",1
"If you take a life you should be punished. But before the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb, it's not yet a life, it's only a POTENTIAL life, like an egg or sperm, that's all.",1
"I think abortion should be banned because if they didn't want the baby in the first place they shouldn't have opened their legs, should've used a condom, started birth control, used spermicide, etc. There are many other options such as giving the baby up for adoption! If you don't understand they are killing the baby while the baby is still alive and forming. The baby can move, feel, cry, etc. Why would you want to kill a innocent child? That's so wrong.",0
"Right, because you post sources for everything you say and all of your opinions are based upon supported facts! ;D",1
"No one is for abortion. There is no group of people who rejoice in the 'death' of the unborn. It is an ultimatum for everyone. I do not have solid views on the matter, though i do not feel that i should force my opinions upon others. Thusly i am pro-choice, and thusly is the reason for the term.",1
I think so too. Every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. I am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the U.S Supreme Court in which all of the judges were men.,1
"abortion is alright with me... obviously a mother who wants an abortion is not planning on taking care of the baby. if she doesn't terminate the pregancy, who's gonna take care of the baby? not her. are you?",1
"1. It's not a person. Abortion to me is no different than jizzing in a rag, sure there is potential that those cells could have made a person, but they aren't now and that they never will shouldn't bother anyone in the least.  2. Given that there is 0 proof that the cluster of cells has any type of self-awareness, a preponderance of proof that the cluster of cells  doesn't  have self-awareness, then it is the case of a person doing something to their own body. People should be allowed to do whatever they like with there own body.   3. Even if abortion were illegal, there is evidence that illegality has never stopped women from getting an abortion if they want one. Making it illegal would  not  save these imaginary people anyway, but it would kill scores of women who decide to get an abortion in a dirty basement instead of a clean hospital.",1
"Even if the law stopped the woman from aborting her fetus, I wonder whether the life of the baby would be normal and happy as the others. Abortion is both for the baby and the mother.",1
"I rather you but out unless you'd like to discuss how to (not just how not to)logically establish whether something is wrong or right.   There isn't any easy way to establish whether something is ""right or wrong"". But, a judgement on whether something is ""right or wrong"" is a judgement based on moral  duties . However, any judgement as such should be supported by arguments that fulfill both truth conditions.",1
"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.  It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.",1
"I guess the implication is that by legalizing abortion, would that encourage in youths a perception that it is therefore okay to have sex since there is always a 'back-up plan' (to simply abort the child)?",0

"The view of ""Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong"" is expected of a pro-lifer looking to force his/her belief on others.  Abortion is actually not unjustified. People have very good reasons to do it. It's not a fun activity, so to arrive at the decision people would have had to consider lots of options.   Abortion is also not the taking of a human life. It's the prevention of a human life, same as having sex with a condom, using the pills, abstinence, etc...  Finally, believe what you want, but don't force it on others. I respect pro-lifers' views, they should respect my views. What I do with my body doesn't affect the quality of their lives. Don't affect the quality of mine!",1
no i wouldn't consider it a baby. i dont consider it a baby until it is living and breathing on its own.,1
"That is stupid... -__- We've made sex safe, you can be on the pill and using condoms and it's the safest sex ever. And if you're using both properly then you are having safe sex. So have as much as you want, in my opinion. lol",1
"I agree that there are times when an abortion is necessary, but when one want's to kill over the fear of parenthood - that is when things are getting out of hand.",0
Abortion is WRONG!  God created that person for a reason.  If your not ready to raise a kid then put it up for adoption so it can be with a good family. Dont murder it! Its wrong. It has a life. If you can have sex then you should be ready for the consequences tht come with it!,0
Abortion doesn't kill a baby because it's not a baby. It's an inviable parasite. It cannot eat or breathe on its own without the host (woman) so it is not its own entity. Therefore abortion removes an unwanted growth. If the fetus were a person than every miscarriage would be a murder and Mother Nature causes miscarriages in 20-45 percent of pregnancies. Are you going to accuse Mother Nature of killing babies? Or the host (woman)? I think not. It's not a baby. It's a bunch of cells.,1
Use your head for once and try to figure out the whole purpose of my argument.Who says you can't you use appeal to emtion or authority in debating? I would like to say who said that? And who says you also can't use different topics if they are similar in the point you are trying to make?,0

"I continually go back and forth on this issue weighing the pros and cons. Sometimes I feel as though it should be illegal because if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child. However, I agree with the above poster on unsafe conditions for those that will ultimately seek out an abortion whether it is legal or not. There are plenty of irresponsible people having sex and having children. I think abortion should be legal and safe sex practices should be enhanced in schools. Abortion should be the last resort.",1
"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws.   I hope you remember this very quote in a few minutes, when I point out  again  that abortion is not considered homicide because the law does not recognize a fetus as a human being, therefor does not extend the same protections to it. The fact that you  think  abortion is murder has no influence on whether or not the law considers abortion to be murder.  As I said, the parasitism issue will no longer be addressed because you continue to ignore very basic evidence and qualified unbiased sources, in favor of presenting me with a page from a pro-life website.   You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being.   When the fetus is inside the mother, it is inseparable from her system, and its lack of a fully formed or functioning brain prevents it from developing or retaining an identity.   The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?    That is so far from the only difference between a fetus and a six month old baby.In the fetus, the brain does not even possess all its parts. That is where the organ comparison comes in. It has absolutely nothing to do with their potential; it has to do with capacity for awareness. In this case, the organ and the fetus have equal capacity for awareness: none.  Six month old babies are capable of feeling pain, reacting voluntarily to external stimuli, and their consciousness is not contested in any form. I actually think it is kind of monstrous to suggest abortion is in any way comparable to killing an infant, implying that women who get abortions are exactly the same as people who beat their infants to death.   Note that when I use fetus, I am not referring to all fetuses but to fetuses before the stage of viability, well before the thalamus is formed or functioning. A fetus beyond the point of viability is another matter, I think, as the interests of both the fetus and the mother could be preserved through an early delivery or c-section.   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?   1. I already said I do not agree with this precedent and I think it is contradictory, again, unless the fetus is past the point of viability.  2. People who perform and receive abortions are not charged with homicide. How could this be true if fetuses were protected under homicide legislation?   It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   At no point did I contest any of the things you just mentioned. Why is this the third time you have repeated this? I have never said I think fetuses should be classify as dead. I have said numerous times I know they are alive. The fact that something is biologically classified as living is not what makes it a human life. Where is the disconnect? What do you not understand about this?   I am frustrated with your apparent refusal to understand simple statements, but please understand I am not asking the following question with the intent of being insulting or belittling. We are clearly having a problem understanding each other. Is English your first language?   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.   In order for one to determine whether a miscarriage was induced or spontaneous, they would have to investigate. Therefor, if a fetus was given the same rights as every other human, then every miscarriage would lead to an automatic investigation because every miscarriage could potentially be a murder. If it had been determined that the mother engaged in any activity that led to the miscarriage, even through negligence, she would be treated as though she contributed to the death of a human being, with all the legal punishment this entails.",1
"1.""Back alley"" abortions would increase if it were made illegal, leading to increased risk of young women dying or becoming sterile.     2.It's better for society to have babies aborted than have them be brought up poor and neglected, where not only will the child suffer but society when that child develops a higher attraction to crime, welfare, etc.   3.It is a more viable option for those who are unable to shoulder the financial burden and responsibility of raising a child on their own.  4.Giving up a child for adoption can be just as emotionally damaging as having an abortion.   5.Abortion is not murder because it is performed before a fetus has developed into a human person.",1
"I would rather a fetus is killed, then for a child to have a horrible life and get neglected by their parents.",1
I think you have one of the best answers to this argument on this whole page. I agree!!!,1
yes abortion should definetly be banned because if you look at it from court/police type of view then you could definetly call it murder if you abort something beause the actual definition of murder is killing somebody with intent.  so abortion should definetly be banned!!!,0
"Yes, stop the problem at the root. Un-born children have no rights because at this stage they have no self-awareness in the slightest. No spiritual existence. Remember, if it has no sapience we can't classify it as a regular, normal human being so it cannot qualify for the default human rights.   If 90% of abortions are made before brain tissue is even created, no need to worry about the ethics of it at all. This stage is merely miniscule life-forms.   This argument proves it is even reasonable to abort your unborn (1-6 week) child if you plainly don’t want superficial scarring (previously an un-heard of reason).   ""So are you making an argument that it is better to not live then live a certain kind of life?""  I am saying that a fetus which is alive by definition will die by choice of another human being and be morally sound all the same because it has no sapience attached to it.   So the whole, 'never having a chance to live' is not a feasible argument simply because we don’t talk in future predicted scenarios. We talk about right-here, right-now. Never what could have been.",0
"Really? So how come when a person commits suicide the state has every right to stop that person from doing it? Why don't you answer that then?   It's because a bunch of angry and sad victims of a suicide decided to give government that right. It has no bearing on a person's autonomy, however.   Why do you keep saying her body. The fetus is inside her body but not her body. The fetus has a completely different DNA and blood type than the mother and if the blood type of the fetus comes in contact with the blood type of the mother it can be fatal.   Parasites, bacteria, and protists all have different DNA from us but still reside within us. We have the final say over their existence because they reside in our bodies.",1
"1. duh, the point is these woman are going to have an abortion whether it's banned or not. So either the cluster of cells is removed and the woman lives. Or the cluster of cells is removed and the woman dies. Either way, abortion being banned has never in human history stopped people from getting abortions.  2. No, it didn't make it rare, that's the point. Banning abortion doesn't stop it, it just hides it and demonizes woman, who many times are only children at the time, and who many times were raped. And you wonder why no one likes talking hardcore Christians about this kind of thing.  3. wtf? have you been reading the white supremacist newsletter again? Europe's population is doing just fine. And there's nothing wrong in and of itself if they do end up having more muslims than whatever they have now. Who cares? Why's it your business what someone else does?  And who the fuck is ""we"" you arrogant ass. The US does not have a ""we""   we're supposed to be founded on the idea of diversity and freedom.

"It makes me sick to think that there are people as thick-skulled as you. Living in your ideal little world with lolli-pop forests and marshmallow skies.  Have you ever heard of RAPE, or INCEST?

well im thirteen so i no how mature a small mind can be so u see people can be mature!,0
"I think that abortion is absolutely wrong in all ways because it's killing a innocent life. For all you know, that baby could've been the one to make a cure for cancer or AIDS. I think that in a situation such as being raped, that the baby is innocent and the baby had nothing to do with whoever raped you, it's not the baby fault. There are all kinds of options in the world like adoption that you could choose if you don't want your baby. Unplanned pregnancy is no reason to have an abortion because I feel like if you had sex willingly then you knew what the possible outcome could be. I AM 100% AGAINST ABORTION FOR ANY REASON. NO BABY DESERVES THAT!",0
"I'm asking you why it's wrong to destroy potential life.  You're saying it's wrong to destroy potential life because it will become life.  In other words, it's wrong to destroy potential life because it's potential life.  This is circular reasoning.  Embryos don't have a say in the matter because they are not yet humans. If I had been aborted as an embryo I would not have given one rat's ass, because I would have been incapable of doing so. No harm, no foul. The world keeps spinning. What's the big deal?",1

"I've seen ""Silent Scream"" four times already; I was convent-schooled and thus unsurprisingly I've been shown lots of graphically disgusting abortion pictures. And y'know what? I'm still not remotely persuaded that it is preferable to ruin women's lives or leave them to die in back alleys.  DNA? Your sperm has DNA. Your hair and skin cells have DNA. Your saliva has DNA. Are sperm, hair, skin, and spit also human beings in their own rights?  About ""thinking, feeling, seeing and hearing"" -- you conceded that an fetus slated for abortion is not capable of doing these things in your post above.  ""By your logic . . . if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em.""  So this new argument that ""Silent Scream"" contradicts your earlier premise that the fetus does NOT ""think, feel, see, or hear"" is simply logically inconsistent.",1
"Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple ""cluster of cells"" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it? Not convinced? Perhaps this example will help my point:  You are walking through a farm one day, and you stumble upon a chicken egg that has been freshly laid. You step on it, and guess what? You have commited murder!  I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside... yet! It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.  By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the ""potential bs,"" and how we should ""outlaw masterbation,"" is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid. Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male. So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation? I certainly wouldn't think billions, millions, or even several thousands!",0
"It's not a sentient being.   I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   It is the woman's body.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   It is none of your business what another does with their body.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.

Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.

"Ok, this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience:   The argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as Barbra(or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument) and is as follows  1.All non-(Human persons) are beings which do not have rights.  2.All fetuses are non-(human persons).  --------------------------------------- -------------------------   3.Therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights.   This is indeed Barbara (and a disjunctive syllogism):   1.All A are B  2.All C are A  --------------------------------------- --------------------------   3.All C are B  The soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non-(human persons) which is dependent on the category of person.    This category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on:   1.A human person is a human being   2.A human person is a human being with the quality of personhood.   This forces us to look into personhood, so lets look into it:  1.Personhood is dependent on the brain,   A. How developed of a brain?    I. How is this decision decided or development measured? Likely by what functions the brain can accomplish, then the importance of those functions would have to be supported.   II. If the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows:   AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.   BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?  In less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do.   Most brain functions change with time. If we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are.  Keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a “human person” from birth to death is hypothetical, that human beings stop and start being “human persons” at times and still retain their rights. Also human beings which lack basic brain functions, such as babies( object permanence, for example. which many animals possess), possess rights. Thus the argument from sapience is unsound. Premise one is not true.  The truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood. The definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation. thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is, no reason to give . This is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such.  Jean piaget(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Jean_Piaget)  tells us that human beings don't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7. We lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2. We also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in-till we reach a later age. It would be difficult to consider anyone a “human person” with out the last 2 abilities.  Also i must mention, fetuses are simply human. There is no such thing as sub-human. The idea of sub-human is a horrible one. It suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top, and because of humanities “superiority”(superiority according to what standard?) they are allowed the ability to do what would otherwise be dis-moral(which seems like a non-sequitur to me).",0

There are many situations under which you are completely wrong. People need to take responsibility for the amount of children being born into broken homes and poverty.

"Abortion is not murder because a fetus is not a human. Therefore, abortion is legal",1
"infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence  -----  I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument. Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.  ----  I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly.   -----  Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.  -----  I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.  -----  I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings.   -----   How very judgmental of you.   You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.  -----   Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.   Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...  -----   note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.   Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.  -----  Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so.     Romans 10:9,10  ""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""  Ephesians 2:8,9:  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works , so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do""  I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments. Paul touches on this in his letters. I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to.",0

Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on?   I did research it.   Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law.   Law IS a form of politics.

Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well.

"people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions. fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible). The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents. Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.",1
"Seek the truth, not what you want the truth to be.  That's why I'm not religious. Which religion? All say to believe, yet why? Must I believe or can I just not believe?

Normally, I am against killing, but a fetus is a lot different than a fully grown human, or even a child.  Anyways, I try to aim for objective truth in an objective world, so unless you believe in the supernatural, or things that can't be proven, my opinion, I've noted is almost always 100% correct, or consistent with my logic/morals.

"That statistic is purely falsified and slanted to fit your point. Yes sex has been on the rise and you blame sex ed? Sex ed was a response to the teen sex rising! You fail to introduce the hundreds of factors that have increase teen sexual behavior.  Allow me to demonstrate a few:  -Increased alcohol abuse   -Christian faith declines, abstinence declines  -Woman gain more rights  -Television idealizes sex  -Society evolves to accept the sex taboo  -Increased drug abuse  -Corporations exploit sexual images  Just to name a few. And you blame SEXUAL EDUCATION?!  The very concept enforced to reduce the outbreak of HIV, teen pregnancy and COUNTLESS STI's and STD's?????  ""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  People I know had sex when they were 13, if they had it any later it would have been too late. Guess what? They used a condom! Now I can guarantee you, the neighborhood I grew up in, they would have had sex at such a young age nonetheless of sexual education. But this example proves that sexual education benefited people in the community. This is the entire point of sex-ed, to educate.  ""You're wrong. They do it again all the time.""  Gratz, you have nothing to prove that statement.   ""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays"" ""...that's not including rape).""   There have been 13 cases of ten-year-olds and under giving birth. All of them were rape victims....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_youngest_birth_mothers    ""attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them... In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'""  Again, I said this before; emotions and sex are purely left for parents. This statement proves no thesis of yours. Sex is not based on emotions on any scale. It is purely hormone based. When you’re in love you still need your hormones for libido. You think animals need love when they have sex? If it is purely natural, you can’t defy the laws of nature.   So tell me, when it is ok to have sex??  ""Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex.""  Firstly, my explanation will serve you better knowing how old you are. I can only assume your maybe under 16 because you have a very repressed view on sex.   So if you’re just a teenager (presumptuously), you would feel perfectly comfortable knowing nothing about sex? It would feel right to understand nothing about what is happening to your body? Then you think about a girl in a naughty way then - oops, what was that? You try and hide your dirty thoughts, thinking that your mind is impure. You carry on this way for the rest of your life. These symptoms have a diagnosis. It’s known as sexual repression. Let me tell you, it is far from uncommon and is a horrible affliction to ones life.   Can I tell you about a group of people who suffered from sexual repression? They grew up with celibacy as their answer. They only thought pure thoughts and repressed all urges. As a result, confused as they were, this group sodomized and indecently assaulted 100 thousand + underage children. These were the priests, the bishops and the pastors. This has been going on long before sexual freedom.   “But at least if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.”  Maybe ‘you’ (the mystical and know-everything teacher) can explain to these kids as to why sex before that age is ‘wrong’ when it clearly is not and especially when it is exercised under the influence of sexual-education and with the help of condoms.   Perhaps you would like to argue why condoms are ‘wrong’ to solidify your statement ;)",1
"I actually believe that abortion should be allowed to be performed in at least the first trimester. I hate this issue though, because I'm fairly wishy-washy on it, considering this is more of a battle of morals and logic than anything.  If a child is going to grow up miserable, or die several days after, might as well just kill it before it has a chance to live in that short agony. And rape babies, nobody is going to want to keep. Incest is... gross, but I'm guessing if it's consensual, then whatever. They probably won't want to get rid of it.",1
Really? So how come when a person commits suicide the state has every right to stop that person from doing it? Why don't you answer that then?  Why do you keep saying her body. The fetus is inside her body but not her body. The fetus has a completely different DNA and blood type than the mother and if the blood type of the fetus comes in contact with the blood type of the mother it can be fatal.,0
"Ok, I'm amazed you're actually being this ridiculous about a simple name.   Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference.   Pro abortion means you want abortions. Pro choice means you want the choice of abortions. There is a  big  difference.  I do not like that people get abortions. I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother.  It's common for pro lifers to accuse pro-choice supporters of being blind to the facts, when it is they who rarely actually consider the women that they're condemning.   Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?   I think it's bad, I'm asking you why it's so bad. You haven't answered any of my questions, you've simply said that it's bad and that it's the same as pro-abort.   Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months?   Please talk about questions that are actually up for debate, you're wasting your time, attacking something that isn't there.   “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”   Useless circular rhetoric, sounds clever, but it proves nothing.",1
"And your taxes wont  link   Not even mentioning that abortion isn't murder,  I see a pattern of you often being misinformed.  Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.  On top of that, it will be less expensive as soon as the millions of self-employed who aren't sick but still can't afford a private plan will be paying into the system.  Unless you're single with no kids and make over 100k a year, or have kids and two incomes and make over 200k a year, you are getting a great deal with this bill.",1

When you are debating, you automatically forego the right to back your position with religious beliefs, or spiritual beliefs; in other words you agree to reason your position with logic, rationality and evidence. Emotional pleas can be used but they should never serve as the core of your position, because emotional pleas are subjective and go the way the wind blows. Even in a theological debate, one must back their position with orthodox texts.  I am a strictly rational individual, and what you said to me by invoking god is that you have a belief but cannot support it with evidence or reason. If I were cruel I would mock that as being a weak position to take, but I think you should be shown why your position is not a good one to take in a debate.",1
"But there is a group of people who worship a book   First of all, Christians don't worship a book.

"Abortion is a really tricky subject to navigate, because on one side you are saying, "" Killing an unborn child is wrong!"" or ""Women have the right to decide what happens with there own body!"".

If you want an abortion because you don't think you are ready to support a child because of your youth you have a valid point. Daughters of teen moms are 22% more likely to become teen moms than their peers. Sons of teen moms are 13% more likely to go to prison than their peers. Not to mention the impact on the teen moms themselves. Less than 35% of teen moms finish high school, and only 1.5% of teen moms get there degree by age 30. I am pro-choice because i don't think it is just to force someone into those statistics.",1
"It's about freedom - a woman's freedom to control her own body, and a couple's freedom to decide when is a good time to bring a child into the world.",1
Ever think that it is because your mother had 2 abortions before you that you are doing well now? It is just as hypothetical to assume that those 2 abortions were just little yous that got denied a chance as it is to assume that those 2 abortions occurred at a time when your mother wasn't ready and when she was ready she did have you and you are being successful.  Hopefully people here aren't against adoption - it is one of the few options for mothers who can and do go through with a pregnancy even when the mother and or father cannot support the child.  One other thing to mention - while you may feel strongly that one choice is better than the other - making something legal or illegal should meet a different test; for example - if a woman is 5 months pregnant and finds out she needs chemotherapy - should the government force her to not get the treatment and risk killing herself and the child all at once? Government cannot imagine every potential abortion scenario and in a free country is not the one that should make those decisions.  Keep up the good work.,1
Thanks for illustrating my point whoever you are :) 123456789,1
It tells me you've been watching a certain anti-abortion video too many times :),1
"Ok, I see the problem now (and it's not the fact that you're 15 because I don't care about your age or gender), it is: you are unable to form any comprehensible form of logics in any of your arguments. Initially I thought I was debating with someone of fair intelligence with the ability to make clear logical arguments, but that opinion has simply dissipated. It scares me that people like you could be in parliament affecting lots of lives. Here's why:  You say ""abortion is a problem, not a solution"" - ummm this is YOUR VIEW. My view is that it's NOT a problem but a RESULT of unwanted pregnancies (which is the real problem (and you admit this in the next couple of sentences. Your point is now out the window, so let's see you actually rebut that directly with something else. Alas you probably will, but not with logic.  An episode of Maury Povich? Is that a fictional TV show? You're using that as a basis for your educational system? FYI, the guest speaker tactic has been done to death everywhere. But its impact is still minimal, it's not reaching enough people. Again, my suggestion of putting a hefty fine on unwanted pregnancies would have more impact.  Ok I'm not going to chew your ""making a law on abstinence"" to pieces, it's essentially dealing with the problem of unwanted pregnancies. We may have some common ground here. I've actually moved past the ""banning unprotected sex"" arguments to now suggest ""making unwanted pregnancies expensive and coupling it with something rehabilitative like a compulsory education on the whole thing.""  The problem of rape has already been dealt with. It's called ILLEGAL and includes a jail term. No need to discuss that here.  Banning abortion wouldn't be necessary if you're actually dealing with the problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. So you say that you're not one who push their belief on others and that you're ""educative"". Then you should stop calling for a ban on abortion. You say you do a lot of research and self-educating on the topic, how come you think banning something will make it go away?   If you continue to argue with a belligerent disregard for logic, I will have no choice but think you an unworthy debater and disengage.",1
"Even the devil can quote scripture for his own purposes.  You do not have the original, therefore everything you have written could completely botched up. It's just like a long game of telephone.    You just precluded your ability to quote scripture for this debate.   I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    The point is that it isn't a choice that you make. You are able to process the decision now because you have a mind. A foetus has no mind. It isn't complete, it cannot think like you can.   Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.    It's basic biology. A developing brain is less sophisticated than an adult one, or child one. You take for granted this fact, that the brain develops in stages and each stage has limitations before the progression to the next. An infant cannot understand abstract concepts. A child cannot understand sexuality. A foetus is not aware like we could consider it. It isn't a child agonising over death.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.    If you have nothing well-thought-out to say, then do not speak. This is a debate and thoughtless statements are not appreciated.  Also, learn your place. You have no possession of the female gender. Theirs is not your body to command over and their life is not yours to play fate with.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it. yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her, you be the one to watch it as it dies, if it isnt alive then why bother?   A child needs love, attention, and it needs to be wanted. Children who are neglected and abused may become criminals. They become broken so they resort to crime and display emotional problems.  Family planning allows us to prevent unwanted children from entering the world.  I feel nothing towards foetal death. It isn't a baby. A baby's death is lamentable because of wasted innocence. A foetus dying has no bitterness because it isn't a person, but a thing which may only be doted upon by those who are not educated enough to know better.   We can only see thing's as human if they breathe talk and walk? Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable. I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   What defines humanity is a philosophical question which I assure you has few absolute answers. Biology suggests that we form in stages, with our minds truly mature in women at her late teenage years, in men at his early twenties. This suggests that you are not fully human until that point, for you are still growing into adulthood. A simpler definition would be that what defines humanity is our identity. We form an identity as we gather memories in this world and reflect upon them to grow. In either definition, a foetus isn't fully human because it is still growing and unable to have identity.",1
"That's right. It's inside the woman. It's a part of her body like any other organs inside her. Until it can survive outside her womb, it's her choice whether she wants to continue to allow it to develop into a human life. What happens after week 20 when theoretically it can survive outside her womb? Well then society, if it so chooses, can keep it alive and would have the right to intervene. Until then, society has no rights.",1
"Your point on whether a child of 15 years is a human being or not is ridiculous.   We're talking about a fetus that can't survive outside the womb, we're talking about a potential life, not an actual life. A 15 year-old is a person so your ""what if"" is simply laughable.",1
You are wrong. Science has proven that life begins at conception .,0
You are wrong. You are not prolife if you think that abortion should be legal for any reason other than to save the mother's life.,0
"What amazes me is that iamdavidh has the patience to put forth logics to argue against your stupid feelings and belief system. The question is never whether the fetus is a human! We all know it's human! It's a human sperm and egg so ofcourse it's human.   The question really is ""is it a person?""... and it's clearly not. Leave your beliefs and bible at home please.",1
"If I was raped, lets say by...my father, and i got pregnant at the age of 14, it would not be mentally healthy for me to go through with my pregnancy! It would wreak havoc on my own psyche and screw my child over from the abnormal hormone fluctuations [stress is bad for the baby in utero]. If the pregnancy would be damaging in any way to the mother, because it really is her choice, I believe abortion is appropriate. I AM NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE USED AS BIRTH CONTROL. If you have more than one abortion because of your own stupid mistakes, then yes, you most definitely carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption. But if the pregnancy is going to be damaging, get the abortion as soon as possible.",1
"Whether it's right or not to take the life of any living being depends entirely upon the answer to one question: What kind of being is it?

"interesting that in the eight years of Bush and the years of Republican controlled Congress and era of conservative judges that th 1973 Roe versus Wad has not been overturned  although they claim to be Christian fundamentalist, they too have a use for abortions ... it not just Democrats that go to Planned Parenthood and private doctors for pregnancy terminations",1

"Once the 20 week period has passed, the fetus has a small chance of surviving outside of the womb. Society can then decide if it wants to outlaw abortions after this period, when the baby can actually become a person independent of its mother.",1
"It's just a tad more deep seated than an opinion...   I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics and it's not actually a sentiment I disagree with, but that something is disgusting  to you  only a fact if you specify that. Disgust is subjective no matter how widely it is shared.   Perhaps in the mind of someone considering one when there are better options.   What makes an option better than abortion? Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives...   First, I am willing to operate on whatever definition of necessary you are using. You used it once in one way, and once in another way. If we've established you're not using logical necessity, that's fine.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options. What are you using to support this claim? Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Sorry, I left out ""improving"". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.   If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact, but I think this still excludes abortion. Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman.   As it is a difficult experience, I don't doubt makes some women stronger. It could also break her or ruin her life if she can't deal with it, or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires. There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.  I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not. You and I are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands, but we haven't because we're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves. Is that unacceptable?    If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.  The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/safety_of_abortion.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                        facts/post_abortion_issues.html",1
You haven't brought any new arguments to the debate. You've simply been using one analogy after another. This is tiresome.,1
"Wow. You actually hit the nail on the spot for the reasons for increased teen sexual behaviour. But let me make it clear (again). I don't blame sexual education. It's one of the reasons.  I think we only disagree on the concept of sex education. Or our experiences of it anyway.  It is good to be taught to practice safe sex. It is good to learn about the dangers/consequences of sex. But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex, they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.  Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The messege was have sex - but make it safe. Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe. The problem is the liberal attitude. Liberal sex education = bad. That's my point.  P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D",0
"I disagree with you at the age of 16 and 18 they do fully understand consequences. Parents and teachers and life teach them that every action has consequences and by that age there have been enough lessons of actions and consequences.   If you think having an abortion fully erases the mind of ""error"" as you call it then well then you never had one. It sure does not erase your mind.",1
"I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   If you only 'blame' the man when he rapes the woman, shouldn't you conversely only blame the woman if she rapes the man? In consensual sex, both partners are equally involved in the decision to give the sperm and the egg the opportunity to meet. You say ""she allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg"" like it came knocking on the door of her egg and she decided to let it in.  What do you feel is gained from assigning blame to anybody?   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.     ac·ci·den·tal   1. happening by chance or accident; not planned; unexpected: an accidental meeting.  2. nonessential; incidental; subsidiary: accidental benefits.  3. a nonessential or subsidiary circumstance, characteristic, or feature.  I would think a review of the definition would be enough to show that yes, accidental pregnancies exist, whether or not you believe in them. When you engage in an activity, you are not automatically consenting to allow the potential negative consequences of that activity to run their course without interference.   For example, every time you get in a car, you realize there is a possibility you will get in a car accident. This does not mean you are consenting to being injured without trying to reverse or mitigate your injuries. You are engaging in activity, recognizing the risks and doing your best to prevent them while still intending to undo any damage that may occur. Removing any sentimentality from the issue of abortion, it is no different. Pregnancy is an occasional consequence of sex and abortion is a way of dealing with that consequence.",0
"Imagine this scenario:  A woman is walking to her house, all of a sudden a man grabs her from an alley. He rapes her. Should the woman be forced to have the baby of the man who raped her?   Even if the baby was put up for adoption, the woman would go through all the pain of having a baby, and the medical fees, and the baby might not be adopted.",1
Foetuses do not grow into trees. I guess I better not care about them because only trees are sacred.   So trees are more important than human beings in your view?  Fair enough that explains your pro elective abortion stance.  How subjectively illogical.,0
"Pregnancy is a biological process.  Therefore, taking an aspirin terminates pregnancy.  If you accept the premises you must necessarily accept the conclusion.  Is that your position?

"Take biology class early abortions you are removing a small fetus that lacks a brain but has a underdeveloped nervous systems which is why they move when abortion apparatus is inserted.

"If they are not prepared for the consequences, then yes.   But to declare them to be irresponsible, by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like, would be presumptuous.   You added a ""technically"" in there which expressed hesitance and some doubt. But this is a good start.   ""Technically"" does not  necessarily  imply hesitance and doubt. I used it in the sense of ""by definition"".   Apparently we are stuck at the human=homo sapien part.   No, we aren't. A zygote may be alive, but it is not a homo sapien.   For example, the colloquial definition of a ""theory"" and a scientific definition of a ""theory"" are completely different.   Which has no bearing on whether the OED's definition is true or not. I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's. You raised the example of ""theory"". According to the OED, a ""theory"" refers to ""A conception or mental scheme of something to be done, or of the method of doing it; a systematic statement of rules or principles to be followed"" or ""A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed."" Tell me, which of these two definitions are not inline with the scientific definition?   Irrelevant. I have no interest in arguing the difference in morality between two identical organisms whose inly difference is mental and physical development.   Then this debate isn't for you. Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive. The concept of sentience  is  one of the bedrocks of the abortion debate. If you are not willing to address this issue, then you shouldn't even be debating here in the first place.",1

"Of course, everyone has right to choose, because it is independent country.In my point of view, abortion must be banned.    Abortion is like a murder as it is the act of taking human life. I don't think that aborting is the easiest thing, what u can do, because it cause many problems with health. For example, the woman did abortion and some years later, when she gets marriage. She can not get pregnant, because of that.   As u know, there is no crime without punishment, because nobody permitted to harm or take the life of another person( but it is not stranger, it is your own child).I think, you should not be such a cold, especially to a child, which you wear under your heart.",0
"False. While society's definition of Pro-life is actually a purely anti-abortion stance. I follow a more traditional understanding of the definition of Pro-life, which is I am for whatever is more conducive to saving human life.Also, did you even read my comment?

Without the option to do wrong, ""right"" is meaningless.",1
"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it’s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it’s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",1
"I think abortion should be legal up to the age of ten, so the parents can make an informed decision.",0
"I agree with Kmac. If you think you are old enough to have sex then you better be old enough and ready to deal with the possible consequences of having sex. There is always that possibility of becoming pregnant, so if you have sex and get pregnant deal with it!! Abortion is just wrong. Why kill someone that has done nothing wrong? The baby should not have to pay for your mistakes. If you can't handle having a child then let someone adopt it, don't kill it!",0
"It's definitely dishonest to present this as a picture of abortion in general, and sadly it preys on people who have no better source of information. Most women will not have abortions using this procedure, and their fetuses will not look at all like that. They probably will not even be recognizably human. If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done. If you are pro-choice, you may have to accept the fact that they are just tough for laypeople to look at, even suction aspiration. It's not at all a point in favor of pro-life; childbirth and open-heart surgery can turn stomachs, too.",1
"OK but what about all the other cases, which are probably 90% of abortions? Why should someone be allowed to get an abortion just because they do not want to live with the consequences of their actions?",0
I think it is ok because the baby doesn't even have the brains to know its being aborted. It technically is alive but its brain isn't developed yet...,1
"I say they should, but it depends. If the woman got raped or a mother could die, I could see some instances where they should not be banned. But basically everything else to me should be banned. So, due to majority, I will say it should be banned :). The term abstinence has apparently become extinct these days...",0
The life of a fetus should have as much value as any other human life.,0
"I agree with you until you said: ""It is arguable that it is 'killing' or 'murdering' a creature, but you cannot end something that hasn't ever been started.""  The fetus being killed most certainly has been started. It is a human being. It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns. Is it OK to kill them too?  I will agree with you other point that women (and men) should be able to do whatever it is they want to their own bodies. But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her. No one should have the right to kill innocent people.",0
"Abortion should not be legal. It causes massive deaths, and every human life has unailinable rights endowed by their CREATOR among these are LIFE, (FIRST) and liberty (SECOND) ... Abortion is always a sad and bad choice. I recently got off a flight from Beiging, China, where I met a VERY happy couple who waited 3 years to adopt the 8mos. old beautiful baby girl that they were finally bringing home with them. What a special occasion! Too bad it is so difficult to adopt here, because there are so few babies available, or they would have. The point is; life matters, and adoption is a positive, and very possible answer where BOTH the mother and baby can have bright futures. There are crisis pregnency centers in most towns with helpful people who care deeply about the mother, and baby. Wouldn't YOU prefer adoption over death for YOURSELF ? What CHOICE do you think the unbornbabies would make?? Who will give the baby, it's choice and chance ?.......Can we unite now? What kind of a society sentences these innocent unborn babies to DEATH, ...and gives LIFE sentences to guilty massmurderers ??? Thankfully, Virginia just voted to stop funding abortions with your taxes through Planned Parenthood ( see Wash. Post 2/28/08). Did you know that Planned Parenthood which sounds so good, is the number one provider of death by abortions ? It is also in approx. 180 other countries offering abortions with America's ( your tax ) money. Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes. That is what the government now does if not stopped. Lets not support Planned Parenthood, who is pro-abortion/death. Let's support the heroes at crisis pregnancy centers who can then better assist mothers in crisis before and after the babies birth...and lets vote pro-LIFE together from now on...

Maybe you should have a look at our arguments and if i was unprepared for him, then how come i add him as my ally? I am not going to repeat myself because like i told aveske if the fetus is not a human then what is it? And doctors and the U.S Supreme Court has ruled that the fetus has life. I have proof of this. Lastly aveske referred to the fetus as a human organism. The deeper scientific meaning of the word organism refers to life so he himself referred to the fetus as human life.

Basically, it's a bad argument as heartfelt for you as it may be.",1
"This question has far greater implications. Are there such things as inalienable rights - human rights? The right to life for example? If there are, then there are two possibilites:  1. Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being. From the moment of conception, a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such, with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being.  2. We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.  As abortion does not affirm to my vision of what an ethical, civilized nation should be like - I'm forced to subscribe to the pro-life position.",0
"I gave you scientific evidence where science says that once sperm meets egg, it is another living human being. Can't you read?   The thing is.....you have not done research on this topic. You have not even looked to see what science says about this. If you did you would know you are wrong. The sperm was alive, when it met the egg which was alive.   There is no moral middle ground on this...you cant sit the fence. You are pro-abortion because you say the woman has the right to choose. And if you give her this right, then who the heck are you to tell her when she can and cant abort....because thats personally when YOU THINK, it should be saved. You wont listen to what science says about life in the beginning........you ignore it....then you bring up what science says when fetus is viable. This is not balanced thinking at all.

"Notice what you have done; You've imposed an arbitrary standard (dependent on the womb of another) and then said it is OK to kill any human being who doesn't meet this standard. That standard can be slid anywhere up or down, from conception to old age. It's what is know as moral relativism and it's a morally bankrupt ethic. The question is not; at what point can we kill it, but what is  it ?  You need to first establish that this standard of yours is morally justified because I'm not persuaded that it is.",0
"Personally, I don't think abortion should be allowed anywhere. Abortion is a cruel way to get rid of a child. The mother always has choices readily available to them, and many hospitals have programs that give unwanted babies to good homes. I think that for those who consider an abortion, they shouldn't have opened their legs in the first place, whether the guy was wearing a glove or not. Unless there was a life-or-death situation where the mother could die with a c-section or die having a baby. then it's appropriate.",0
"I think there is an underlying definition inadequacy here. What pro-abortionists deem lives seems incompatible with what anti-abortionists believe in. I myself do not believe that life begins at conception, but rather at birth. That is why I cannot cede to the 'thousands of deaths'. I do not define them as deaths, but rather as a treatment for what essentially is a parasite, until birth. And just because you call this treatment by emotionally evocative names dosent make it any less right. See blamo in regards to your comment about science.",1

"""Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.""   This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.   ""However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.""   This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.   ""Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.""   What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.   You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.   ""Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.""   The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference.    ""It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body.""   Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.      ""you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.""   And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.   ""Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life""   When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).",0
"Since you haven't disputed my other arguments on the other end, I shall simply respond to this one.   Which ones?   Which says absolutely nothing about abortion is morally right or wrong.   Why should someone be killed for anther person's mistake?   Thus, your idea of whether sex is intentional or not would depend on whose perspective you are taking.   From either perspective (with the exception of rape). Thus, people should be held responsible for their actions. In this case, that means raising a child.  The entire purpose of sex is for fertilization to occur. It isn't an ""accident"" at all. It is deliberate and intentional.    An earthquake could be natural.   An Earthquake isn't the fault of the people liven near it. That is a terrible analogy. They are not bringing an earthquake upon themselves as they are with sex.",0

"I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights. Also I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.Or enother example, permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient. So, because of these reasons I believe that abortion should be legal.",1

"only 19% of polled people believe ""abortion is wrong no matter what""  I'm assuming at least 4% of those don't understand specific diseases that account for around 1-3% of abortions performed because the fetus is grotesquely misformed and birthing it will result in the fetus' death within minutes and potentially the mother's death if not aborted.  So yeah, 15%.  The problem is for you, most don't know about abortion, what it actually entails, why it is actually performed, in what numbers, and what women did before it was available.  Once they know these numbers; that before it was legal there were just as many abortions but instead they were performed in alleys and basements, that the vast majority that have abortions do it in the first 2-4 weeks, that the vast majority also were either raped or are having an aborition due to some medical issue, or that the women you and your ilk constantly demonize, the ones who casually decide on this course of action make up such a low percent you might as well outlaw instances of albino,  then even those answering ""oh yeah whatever, I'm pro-life"" would actually change to pro-choice.

Hosea 9:11-17 (King James Version)    11As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.   12Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!   13Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.   14Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.   15All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.   16Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.   17My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.   34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.   35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.   36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.   37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.   38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.   39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man.

What makes a fetus not  a  human?,0
"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.   Of course it doesn't disqualify them from being considered human. But it  does  mean that they are not persons, i.e. they do not possess the essential characteristics of personhood, which are rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.   But you haven't stated whether abortion, in such unfortunate circumstances, are right or wrong.   3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.   On the contrary, this  is  an issue of whether you would consider abortion as murder or not. Furthermore, you yourself seem to think that this issue is paramount to the debate since you went on to talk about the legalisation of murder and used that as an analogy.   4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.   My question to you is: is abortion morally acceptable?   5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?   You seem to forget that rape is also never the fault of the  victim . With this being true, how can you deny the victim/mother-to-be the right to make choices concerning her own body if it is not her fault in the first place?",1

You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.   In other words, the bible teaches us that god cares nothing for the lives of children. Indeed, abortion would be godly behaviour, and don't you wish to emulate god?",1
"Abortion is aw right that should be based solely on the woman's decision. There is no reason for abortion to be banned, and in fact, that is restricting the rights of women by not allowing them to have abortions. Also, think of those who have been raped and sexually abused and have no choice but to bear the child of a person who did such horrible things to them. An abortion is the only way to escape raising something that would always remind that person of something horrible in their life.",1
You need a better interpreter then me but i will give it my best. Jesus here is speaking that the Old Testament was speaking of his coming. (verses 17-18)  In verse 19 he is talking about the 10 Commandment. When Jesus was crucified it ended some of the laws in the Old Testament not including the 10 Commandments.  Here is a link to that:  http://www.gotquestions.org/ Christian-law.html,0

Im sixteen and have been quite successful on create debate. Age is not everything,0
"I agree that intelligence and desire are two different things but...  Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.  If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.   What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her? It was her mistake that created him, not his. Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?",0
"Do you have a informed conscious mind? Where you once a fetus? I am going to assume that both of those answers is yes, thus it matters little whether a fetus is conscious, merely that if allowed to grow and develop it will have a conscious mind, but if an abortion is carried out that life will never be given a chance to develop. Just imagine what this world would be like if Jonas Salk, or Sir Isaac Newton, or Albert Einstein, or Abraham Lincoln, or George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson had been aborted as children. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like.",0

"In certain cases, I can see it as a necessity and a viable option. These cases are incest, rape, and endangerment to the mother's life. In almost all other cases, I don't see abortion as a responsible or a moral way to handle pregnancy. If a mother doesn't want a baby, her first step should be to use birth protection, whether it's a pill, surgery, or condom. If she doesn't use any precaution, then it's her fault for being irresponsible and she should carry the baby to term. Adoption is very successful and if she doesn't want to go through that, then she could always raise the baby anyway. Now if she uses protection in some form, but it fails, then she could always take a morning after pill, like Plan B. Pills like that safely ""miscarry"", for lack of better term, before the egg and sperm become fertilized. Other than that, she has no right to end a life. Sex is a wonderful thing, but people need to realize that it comes with consequences and responsibilities. Teenage girls can't just have sex with whomever and expect abortion to be there every time.",0

Abortion is not banned. The murder of the unborn  is  illegal and punishable as murder.

"Well, I think very grey here.  The deal is that at the end of the day, if you had an abortion, well you just killed a future human being. It doesn't matter when conception is or when YOU think that baby actually turned into a real human being. You just killed a life, a future.   So yes, at the end of the day... Abortion is essentially murder.   However, I think that under any circumstance, a woman should be able to abort her own baby. A woman has her right to her body, it is going to be her pain and her blood and tears going into this young's life. If a woman strongly believes that she isn't prepared for parenthood then she has the right to her own body.   It is also the right to her mind. Abortion is not easy, just like any type of surgery it leaves scars. Not only the physical ones but also the mental ones. Women have to deal with the thought of the murder of their own child for the rest of her life. She has to think of the suffering of that child and the pain of her child... That was never even born.   Abortion is also risky, woman and their... Umm...... ""companions""/companion..... Should talk over the risks of the surgery and the abortion itself. ",1

"“It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living?”  Anyone who bluntly says an unborn child is a living thing is missing the concept. People need a wider understanding of this topic as it is of huge philosophical importance. Does an unborn baby have self-awareness/sapience/soul/spirit/ intellect/free-thought?    If not, abortion is no crime  “I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions, that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash.”  Quite a harsh statement. Seeing as the main people who need abortions are teen mothers. These people are far-worse off than any person not capable of mothering children. I am guessing your auntie is aged 30-40, middle-class. These teens are pregnant; they get ostracized, have to fight for economic dependence and may soon be forced to limit the growth of their education to take care of a child. This will ultimately lead to very poor living standards for both of them in the future. If she doesn’t get an abortion, two lives are ruined and we have another generation of dysfunctional youths consisting of crack fiends, prostitutes, pimps, gang members and robbers. Low level income will force them to poor strata’s of society.   Don’t give me some inspirational story about how some mum got out of a life of hardship and she and her son are doing fine. That’s not reality for the vast majority. I grew up in a shitty neighborhood and I would like to see the last of these dysfunctional youths off the street, back in school and focusing on their career. However we can’t just make it happen, first we have to make sure there is not going to be more of them in the future.   “Why won't they just have the baby and give it to someone like my aunt.”  I agree.",1

"This argument has already been covered, so I don't know why you're repeating it. But since you have, i will reply again:  Protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place. You're preventing fertilization from happening, some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed, neither should abortion.  I get you're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex, so what you should argue for is that UNPROTECTED SEX SHOULD BE BANNED, not abortion should be banned! Abortion is dealing with the aftermath, so let it be dealt with! If you want to PREVENT, then outlaw UNPROTECTED SEX. Make it illegal! Just like riding a bike without a helmet! It's illegal to ride bikes without helmets (at least in some countries).",1
"To be honest, abortion is murder, as admitted by many scientists. However, the most common abortion is resulting from people being careless and stupid, not rape. Even in the case of rape, abortion should not be done. Even if the fetus is not alive, why terminate it? Who knows? What if the baby would have been born and developed in to a legendary scientist with an IQ of 200? My friend's mother was advised to abort her unborn child because it was very likely the baby would be born with a defect. She refused, and he was born without any defects and actually is a gifted learner in very advanced classes. So by your logic, if someone runs into your yard and plants an oak tree seed, you should take it out of the ground and dispose of it because it was a mistake? Ridiculous.......",0

To be honest, there are many things I have done that have affected the world, all of which relate to Greenhouse Gas emissions and preventions.  Anyway, my point is that one man makes a difference, whether we are born or not makes a difference. The level of difference varies, as all men/women are not created equal.

"It's wrong to kill a child just because you don't want to raise it. You knew the risk when you chose to have sex. As for rape cases, your right to choose was stolen from you, but that does not give you the right to take away someones right to live.   There is always adoption if you don't want to raise your child. And yes it's a child. Just because it's smaller and less developed does not make it any less of a child. Just like a child being smaller and less developed than an adult does not make it any less human.",0
"It seems to me that both sides of this topic tend to be unreasonable. Many pro-lifers go so far as to assert that the morning after pill is murder, which is ludicrous. On the other hand, some pro-choice groups don't want any restrictions on abortion, which is equally ludicrous.   I am trying to have an open mind, so my question for the pro-choice group is, should there be any restrictions on abortion at all? Should we (the people) allow a woman to decide she doesn't want her child as it is coming down the birth canal at 9 months?",0

"Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident.   It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally. You continually present the child as an accident. This means you have a knowledge of biology equivalent to that of a 4th grader in middle America. Or. You are knowingly stating lies to further an unfounded point out of lack of an actual argument. The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring. By making it a pleasure activity, you corrupt its true purpose. Now this is fine as long as one is prepared for that stupid, implausible. far-fetched, unlikely, ludicrous scenario where... what is actually supposed to happen happens. Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   And none of which are usually fatal.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases. I am on the side of life. If death is the result in either case, why put the parents through unneeded trauma? And my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape, thus, it is my only other exception.   That was not my point.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.",0

"Well hey, it has the potential to do all those things. You can't know it wont. Why is a sperm suddenly too precious to let die just because it meets an egg? Especially when any other sperm can do the same damn thing.   Sperm and fetus are the same, the only difference is a fetus is a few steps closer to being birthed. You're older than me, probably a few steps closer to making your own children than I am. Is your life worth more than mine? Surely you must think so. A fetus is closer to being born than a sperm, just as you are closer to creating a fetus than I am. You're one step farther on the chain, so, is it alright for people like me to die en masse as long as you get to live?  And furthermore, I am farther along the chain of life than a fetus. I am much more capable of creating life than a fetus. I have much more potential at this time. Sure, the fetus has the potential to one day be like me, but right now it is not. That means it's worth less right? Is it o.k. to abort millions of un-born children but not o.k. to kill me?   No? But at the same time, you say it is o.k. to let millions of sperm die, but wrong to kill a fetus. Why? Because one is farther down the road of life than the other? Or is the life of a fetus worth more than any other conceivable form of life?",1
"""You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?""   That's exactly what I think!  Riding a bike without a helmet is not a good comparison when comparing it to sex. Sure, it shows that the consequences could be fatal, but with the case of pregnancy, one life is certainly at risk, and that could easily become two.   ""...this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population?""   Again, you are making assumptions, and they are wrong.  I am all for childbirth, it keeps the system moving. I am against overpopulation. I suggest that rather than kill of a mistake, we educate to prevent the mistake from occurring. Overpopulation is way off the point; my point is that childbirth keeps the population where it should be!   ""...but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!!""   Then it is too late.  You have just admitted something that I have stated in a previous argument:  ""unprotected sex will become the next underground drug.""  And guess what else? Then you see STD's creep back into the problem, in fact, potentially much worse than it was before! And sure, perhaps  some  people will learn, but not  all.   You need to admit that banning unprotected sex is a failing system with too many flaws to test. We need to educate productively if we are going to get anywhere with this problem!",0

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1

"As much as I'm against it and think what a horrible feeling and decision that must be for the women, abortion should not be banned altogether.

It is a very hard topic that I struggle with. Ultimately the choice lies within the women. But what a awful one to make, they will live with it for the rest of their life.",1

Should the number of feminist activists out there decide our choice to maintain womens' suffrage?   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   You don't actually care about the mother, so why bring this up?  It's more of a loaded question anyway because most medical procedures have a mortality rate, and are legal. Also women who undergo late-term abortion themselves are under increased risk of harm.

But the created human being is not apart of the womans body that is what you just don't get. She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either. The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame...unless a rape occurred.   Abortion is the most performed medical procedure on earth. It is not like other procedures as abortion kills. The abortionists task, goal is to make sure the human being who is alive, is dead when he/she gets through with it. Now if you don't value life then you condone it. If you do, then you don't.

No hospital on earth would deny lifesaving measures taken to save a child. Even in the cases where parents want to deny....for religious reasons, the courts usually overturn their wishes.

In this case, it is a conflict between two people and each of their's physical autonomy, it isn't a degradation of physical autonomy in favor of something else.

"I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?   I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.

There are good reasons to believe why abortion should only be legal within the first trimester only.   Thats like child abuse.   This is a textbook example of a false analogy. A fetus is not the equivalent of a child.   It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped.   Yes it does. There have been studies of how the children of rape victims are negatively affected in terms of their psychological development, especially if there is a missing parent.   We live in a sexually active society.   We have always lived in a sexually active society. If our society is sexually inactive, the human race would have been extinct by now.   More couples live together today than get married.   I don't see your point. Married couples live together. And you can choose to live together first and get married later. It has no bearing on whether abortion is right or wrong.   We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant.   And who is ""the deviant""?   Kids know about sex earlier than ever today.   That's good! I'd rather have my kids know about sex earlier and learn how to protect themselves than to be ignorant and cause unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of knowledge.

In quite a similar way, in fact; they are a part of her system and depend on it to live. If removed from her body, they will die.   Abortion terminates that life or the process of becoming a life.   The law should not protect a potential human life at the expense of an established one.   Ya know what else terminates life?   Stepping on a spider?    Murder.   Oh.

The difference between a child and an adult is stage of development, as is the difference between a fetus and adult.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.   It fits the biological definition of life and has an individual human genetic code. It is biologically classified as an individual human being.   A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.   Neither can a child nor someone who is asexual by defect. Are they not fully human on your view?   But she can't reproduce asexually, right?   Her cells reproduce like everyone else's. She cannot, however make another human life through sexual reproduction. Think of it this way: She's a human female who has a hormone abnormality such that she has no womb or vagina. She is incapable of ever having a child because she lacks these necessary reproductive parts.   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just ""working on it.""   Your analogy doesn't represent what's going on. Let's move from redesigning a kitchen to building a house. The same scenario happens, and you come in asking what he's done with the kitchen. He says he's done nothing with the kitchen yet, however he's laid the foundation and started constructing the walls. It would be silly to expect a fetus to make reproductive organs before other things like a heart, skin, etc.   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.   See first point.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her.   You're right. However that in no way gives her the right to harm the baby. That's like stealing someone's wallet because someone else stole yours - it makes no sense.   The right to choose what she does with her body.   But she's not killing her own organ. She's not getting an ear pierced or anything. She's choosing what to do with the baby's body, not hers. She's killing the individual life inside her, not one of her own organs or tissues.   The right to choose.   To choose what, though? To end the life of another who has not wronged anyone? Isn't that the very definition of murder? I agree the mother should be able to do whatever she wants with her own body, but the baby is not a part of her - it's just geographically located in her for the time being.   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.   Thank you.",0

"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus? You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well. If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence. And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.",0

"You do not get the point.  Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   If the law changes, it still doesn't change that birth is a distinct and unambiguous process separating the foetus from the newborn (also, I am aware of cesarean section, I still consider this birthing).  In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word ""unique"" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.",1

This the UK abortion act.  To comply with the 1967 Abortion Act, two doctors must give their consent, stating that to continue with the pregnancy would present a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children.  This is my view entirely. You can't pin point exact opinions or 'when is it murder' because it  always  depends on circumstance.

"I don’t care to debate nor discuss your convoluted justifications for destroying a human fetus or embryo. My question to you: Why did your mother not destroy you while you were nothing but a cellular glob?  Answer: Because your mother, and probably your father, loved you more than they loved themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hypocrite! You are ready to justify the killing of human fetuses, while at the same time ignorant of the fact that ‘your’ bullshit argument is possible by reason of your mother’s refusal to kill you while your were nothing but a cellular glob!   A female like you who is willing to justify the most cowardice of crimes against her own would-be progeny will commit any manner of crime against her own offspring. So, I think you should make certain that no cellular glob that is human in nature should ever be allowed to grow within your womb, for any child that is born of your matrix will most likely be sacrificed for your own selfish benefit.  This is no argument!! Why, because, you have confessed to the innocence of killing your own would-be progeny.   Down-vote all of my arguments! It still will not change the fact of your willingness to advocate not only the killing of all human fetuses (yes, all human fetuses), but the killing of your own would-be children.   Go ahead! Justify yourself, for your response is nothing more than a self-justification via the state agreeing with you that should kill your un-born progeny.   Oh, I can say much more about females such as you. Please, provoke me!  BTW, how many children have you given birth to?",0

"People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society.   But prior to this, they can. Besides, we know that they are human beings anyway. They are independent of a natural host, and would be able to do the things I specified if they weren't afflicted by a condition. My concern is that I doubt a fetus could do those things regardless of condition.    is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance.   Not until the third trimester, in which abortion is illegal anyway. A fetus cannot do any of the things I specified maximally, if at all, prior to the third trimester. It is, by definition, a parasite until about 20 weeks or so.    how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?   Because I obviously disagree that a fetus can do those things.   It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to.   I know that. But when we are talking about defining  human  life, the sexual one is the only definition that matters.    Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.   I'm not disputing that they are alive. I'm disputing on the grounds that asexual reproduction is not human, which is all that needs to be considered. Thus, a fetus does not have all the biological features you or I have from the moment of conception. It also lacks many other things, but those aren't necessary for me to disagree with your premises.   I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases.   A few hypothetical scenarios then..   1.  A mother has been raped. Yay or nay to abortion, and why?   2.  The mother will suffer serious health problems if she carries to full term. Yay or nay?   3.  The baby will suffer serious health problems when birthed. Yay or nay?   4.  A train is heading down a track. If not diverted, it will kill a fetus (hypothetically speaking). You can divert the train, but if you do, it will kill a woman. You know nothing about either subject. What do you do?",1
"Listen, you want to believe it's a living thing based on that video, fine, I'll trust science. If science says it's a sentient being, I'll be against it.

You know what, beatles make a noise when you squish them. They're not sentient though, and they actually have more brains than a fetus before the first couple weeks.  Meanwhile, these poor girls, half the time they were raped, or their still just kids them self,  and you get these nuts calling them nazis and killers and everything else,  you know what, they're not killers. I don't know what a fetus is, you don't, but science does, and science says they aren't people yet.  It says they're people after the third-trimester,  before then, leave these girls alone until you have some scientific proof beyond,  ""I really really really really  feel  it's a living person.""

"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?   A person with Alzheimers has started to lose their awareness, their brain is literally being destroyed. We grant them this exception out of mercy.  However refer to what I said before: laws are not based on reality, but what people feel ought to be. I don't care about what law says.   Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?   When you kill cell, you kill life, but not A LIFE. Same with early-stage abortion.   You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.   I answered you before on this topic: laws are not required to be consistent with each other. That one is allowed and the other forbade is not representative of our stance that a woman ought to have control over her body, but is representative of our legal system's inconsistency.   If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.   I did not say this. I said that how much it is performed has no bearing on whether it should be illegal. This is about granting a woman the ability to terminate her pregnancy, a very personal choice that affects her body. It isn't about punishing women who have abortions commonly.   Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.   Since you're being obtuse, I'll explain this to you explicitly:  Deaths caused by surgical abortion in a hospital (where trained physicians and emergency equipment reside): some number.  Deaths caused by surgical abortion at home (since abortion is illegal and the woman has to operate on herself): higher than the previous number.   Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.   Again, explicit language:  Abortion exists to end unwanted pregnancies. Your concern over repeat abortions is based on personal feelings of morality and a desire to punish irresponsible women, it is irrelevant to the aim of abortion: ending unwanted pregnancies.  Should we ban condoms because some people have dozens of partners and are avoiding the consequences of disease? No. Condoms exist to prevent pregnancy.   It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.   Sorry to disappoint you, but your arguments are all over the place. You have no direction and I have to keep you on topic.  You're free believe that you'll somehow ""beat me,"" but if this is your best caliber of argument style, you'd better just ask me to help you learn how to improve your debate tactics.   Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?   Of course I understand your questions. I can tell you're off topic because whenever you ask a question that appeals to an authority or my emotions rather than the issue at hand, a woman's right to end her pregnancy and the scientific fact that most aborted foetuses cannot be self aware, I know you're obscuring the topic.   I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.   You're still but a child, and could learn a few things from seasoned adults who know much more about these topics than you.   Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.   And you don't think that critical thinking on my behalf has prevented me from engaging your red herring topics, hmm?  Winning an argument is real life has little to do with the truth. That's why politicians engage in petty topics and the news is full of mud slinging. That's why in the United States, half the population believes the earth is under 10000 years old.  You might have had a busy few years of your life, but don't forget that you're still young and have a lot more to learn. Now please, proceed in the debate but focus of the issue of foetal awareness, and compare it to the woman's level of awareness. Also look into the dangers of illegal abortions, and discuss the societal effects of forced pregnancy on unprepared mothers.",1

If abortion is illegal then someone who made a mistake in having sex, such as a teen, can't tell anyone about it for obvious reasons. The only person she tells is a best friend and she can't have the baby because the parents will find out so her only option is abortion. OH WAIT! Abortion is illegal so she has to go to some old lady in the trailer park or do it herself with a coat hangar, either way she will end up with a disease (that I can't remember the name). Abortion is wrong but should not be illegal.  Also, I really don't want to sound mean or offensive but this probably is: Abortion will help with population control. Our world's population is increasing faster than ever. we need to keep our resources. And the main people that want abortions are usually careless people or rape victims. Most families would either be able to take care of the child or be courteous enough to put the baby up for adoption. So I guess it really all comes down to practicing safe sex and coming down harder on rapists.",1

In my personal opinion, once the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb (which means society can theoretically take care of the baby without the mother's input) then society can intervene.

What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?

Oh wait that's because I didn't say that... My claims of you being sexist are because what you said  is  sexist. You're just trying to stipulate what I think when I have not said anything along the lines of males shouldn't be involved or have a say.    You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support   Huh? Every woman that has a child is single and goes after the father for child support? Not that this has any relevance to abortion since the child would have to be born for a father to pay for it.   The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this   Sexist again. He allows himself to do it as much as she allows him.    THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD   I don't deny him the right. The mother does, not once have I said this is right or correct. Stop putting words into my mouth. And they aren't always denied the right anyway. A lot of woman consult with the father before having a termination.   and your giving her a pity party   So any father who provides for his child, within a relationship or not, is simply giving their child money out of pity? Don't be so idiotic. And stop implying that all a father does is pay money he cares for the child as much as the mother. And by the way, damn right he should pay. He had sex without contraception he knew the consequences as much as the woman, he should be involved with providing financially as much the mother!    Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried   Since a unborn baby relies on the mother to provide for it through the umbilical cord of course it's a part of her. The embryo didn't rely on the petri dish to nurture and nourish it.   But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   I try my best to avoid getting angry but you just keep making up awful lies about me. I not once said anyone isn't worthy to live or deserves to die. I said I understand if a woman wants to have an abortion for these reasons.   You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic.   Who did I blame? When did I say a woman is dragged into an abortion clinic?  Look debate with me all you like but don't for one moment assume that you know everything about my opinions and thoughts. Instead of accusing me of ludicrous opinions and awful things that I have said not said perhaps ask for my view on a topic.",1
"Baby is a gift from God. Kill a baby is a crime. When a woman has an abortion, she will always think about the baby she might have had. She will always think about the future that could have happened with her baby which will always remind her that she killed it. Because she has had an abortion, she will never have a good life, and her conscience will remind her of what she had done.",0

"""People like me"" huh? Wow you sure do know a lot about me and my ilk for a 17 year old kid.  At any rate, your link only further's my point since it is not even until week 6 that any sort of brain wave is detected and the vast vast majority of abortions happen in the first two weeks.   And  your link says nothing of being self-aware or feeling pain... which is my argument.  What you have done is  changed  my argument to one you feel you can argue against. However, whether a fetus were inside a human, or laid in a nest, the fact would remain it has no capacity for any of the thought or emotion which makes it human, and therefore I would still not be against abortion.  And I'm refusing your enemy request. You pro-force-women-rape-victims-and-teenag e-girls  to have kids they don't want get all emotional on this subject. You likely aren't thinking straight right now.",1

"Pros of Abortion   Many a times, abortion helps to safeguard women's health. There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth. But abortion should be carried out after proper medical advice as it can lead to potential miscarriages in the future.",1

Comparitively, because legal practioners would be regulated, there is an expected minimum, a guarantee of sorts, at least, if you will.",1
"are you suggesting that abortions are already ""outside the law""?   No.....I was responding to the post that ""people will just get illegal abortions anyway"" I was simply pointing out that is not a good reason to keep or make something legal.  ""Besides, making certain recreational drugs legal allow certain societies to control it better""  Considering these drugs are NOT legal, you have no proof to back that statement up. Secondly, you cannot compare the 2. Abortions would most likely go down if it was illegal as most people would be too scared to do them illegally.",0
"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......it’s NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said it’s unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, “It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.”  Am I calling names? Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crass…sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blame……and blame you do, for what is a woman’s issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortions….because I know what it’s like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess what………..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted on……‘You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.”  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robbery….and they are caught….does the police just say….ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didn’t show up, the nurse refuse to do it…the baby might have a chance.   You said, “ Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.”  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isn’t that what it’s all about, you said so yourself didn’t you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,“ Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.”  I said, if a woman and man are married……he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she can’t hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificate…and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, “What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.”  Well you are wrong again….   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issue….personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  “If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",0
"You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?  Just compare it with many other things that are illegal: riding a bike without helmet, not wearing a seatbelt in a car. Most of the time, the cops don't know if you're wearing your seatbelt or not! But they certainly would know if you crashed your car!!! So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!! Then you'd be fined lots of money, or the fine should be built into the cost of an abortion!!! That should be a deterent, wouldn't you say? Eventually people will learn that it's not good to have unprotected sex, they won't have to be told any more. Like wearing a seatbelt in a car, it's become second nature to people now.  ""Promoting childbirth""? I'm sorry but this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population? That's just dictatorship, pure and simple.

An abortion done for reasons cuz you made out with out protection is Bizzare. But,sometimes abortion is a requirement. My Best Friend's neighbour had an abortion. That abortion was needed cuz not only was she physically unfit but also mentally imbalanced. If they let the baby grow in her, she would probably harm the baby before he met the World. I'm not trying to side anyone's reason. I'm just saying that the World has to work in accordance with the right amount. You cannot just make plain judgments as being in a society where you can place yourself in a million situations where a better choice could have made a huge difference, instead of just opting for a solution that seemed to you had no other choice.",1
"Looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity. Somethings are obviously wrong like theft, rape and murder. To say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious. Now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act. Not a place I want to go.   Of course no one wants to get an abortion   If that were true no one would get an abortion. People get abortions because they want to.  In regards to ""feel something"" and ""the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes"" You seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion, a suffering that last a life time. That suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant. That's the suffering I want to end. Not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead Nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks. It's called The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   Because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those. Adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that's exactly what your standard does. You ought to be protecting the weak and innocent, not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing. For example you said  a viable fetus should be considered a full human being . So those that are not, are not human? You've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them, I'm sorry but that's not proper justification. I do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through. All I have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then I'm free to kill you; might makes right.   That's why abortion should be banned, because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human. If we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it's head because laws are meant to protect people. But who is a person is subject to the opinion of another. I don't know about you but I never would want to be treated like that.",0

So, I am still awaiting a list of illogical emotions.   (Have you heard the expression, “a fool’s errand”? If not, you certainly will once you realize the terms ‘logical’ and ‘illogical’ are not predicable of emotions.)

No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite.   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.    Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply disallowing the fetus to continue living within her.   Thus killing a human being.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of ""parasite"" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?",0

Why would a pro-lifer be for killing an innocent baby in an incident of rape, whereas if the woman conceived a baby with her consent, she is absolutely forbidden to abort the baby because it's murder.   Because pro-life and pro-choice are idiotic. People can say they're pro-life because they don't know what else to say, but if they take a neutral stance they're better off then being rigidly pro-life.  I'll admit it's silly for them to call themselves pro-life when they are not, but they're still being smart to try and go for a middle man. It's not necessarily their fault culture requires that they pick a side.  Being neutral can be hard.   Why the double standard and inconsistency?   I'm not saying it's perfect. If you start with a flawed, rigid, one-sided position you're likely to not get much of anywhere. That's why I will never label myself pro-life or pro-choice, honestly. But that's also why these two extreme should at least have a middle man for middle-man opinions. Saying that we should pick pro-choice or pro-life, which this debate forces, is ridiculous.

"I do agree with you on most points, I believe we do share a similar opinions.  However I don’t know if you were raised in the Amish Province in Pennsylvania or Vatican City but this society we will on now, IS sex crazed even if you aren’t. A society raised by bikini models and skimpy clothing isn't a factor of a non-sex crazed society. It’s getting more and more as sexual repression becomes less and less.   Think about it this way, guys think about sex every 3 seconds, that a fact! Girls go out wearing barely anything for sexual is now days.   ""A teen mother is dependent on her own mother. She is in no economic situation to even raise her. She is burdening her network of support, but given proper support can indeed get an education and a wonderful life. ""  This is true for most middle to upper class societies. However I talk mostly on behalf on people on the more downtrodden communities because I used to come from one. Teen mums, who are left with a baby to take care of and rely on their mums for support, don’t always have a reliable income themselves. We can’t assume every household is economically stable enough fit to take another child into their family.    ""Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.”  Yes I grew up in one of these neighborhoods and it looks like your friends were lucky. However we have to look at the community as a whole not a small sample. The social problems with teens start can start with the fatherless household, or the mum always working or the poor living standards. Worst of all these affects are only exacerbated by the poor kind of environment the child will grow up in. There will be crime, alcohol abuse and many others. It may not have affected your friends but you have to realize this is where teen disfunctionality starts and fuels the next generation of crime, prostitution, drug pushers and gang members. I always tend to look at the worst case scenarios rather than the best.  I am happy for you friend for breaking that cycle, however again we cant rely on people to eventually just straighten their lives out, you must realize how lucky your friends are. Not everyone will have the same support they did.  If we want to help the community we have to give them all the education they deserve.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1
"Really? Give me one reason why? So are you implying that when you were in the womb of your mother you were unworthy of human rights? We are talking about the ""life of a developing human being for your information"".   Life is not ""a life"" intrinsically because it has no proper brain. A mass of cells knows nothing.  Now that I was born, I earned human rights.  Why give an unintelligent mass of tissues or cells human rights?   Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to?   I don't care about it. The court has little relevance to reality. If it was a scientific journal, I would care.   For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?   It doesn't matter if the tissue is human. When you donate a kidney, is that kidney ""a life"" or just ""life"" Hmm? A foetus isn't self-aware.  Organism is the most inclusive term for life.   That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.   What I said was a rational statement. I still support it no matter how you try to appeal to my emotions.  The simple fact is that abortion culls unwanted offspring from the population. A child should be wanted, and prepared for.  Go ahead. Try to make an argument that an unwanted child or a child raised as a burden are both GOOD things for society.",1
"Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as ""its my body its my choice"" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.   Selfishless is not illegal, nor should it be.  The fetus  is  making its home inside the mother's body, thus the choice of its continued residence there should not fall to anyone else but her. I am sure you enjoy being able to decide what medical procedures are performed or not performed on your body.   Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.    If abortion is immoral because the fetus is alive, and all things are equally alive, then abortion is the same as uprooting a weed.    There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves.   Foregoing an abortion does not cure the infertility of strangers.   If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.   There is no shortage of existing children who do not have homes. There is no reason to add to the number.  I am going to guess you have never seriously considered what it might be like to be  forced  to be pregnant based on what someone else thinks you are allowed to do with your body.   If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.   No, I wouldn't. If I was a fetus, I would be incapable of anger. If I was conscious, as I am now, I certainly wouldn't be happy, but I would never make another human function as a life support system for me.",1
"Yes, abortion should be banned. What about adoption? They need to stand up for the mistake they made and have the baby, and if it is unwanted, put it up for adoption. Just don't kill it. I understand that the baby really isn't a baby yet but if a baby isn't wanted, then the person needs to have safe sex. It isn't the baby's fault.",0
"1. What is your philosophical definition of life?  2. Yes it does. Go read any biology text book.  3. It's not an assumption, it's a deduction based off of the biological definition of life and its unique genetic code. I'll wait on your philosophical definition of life before commenting further.  4. Prevention of possible life is not murder, I agree. This goes back to defining what life is. Again I'll wait.",0
"I am aware that your arguments were for someone else. However, I have a couple remarks about your arguments that I would like to share with you…   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy.    What about the victims of rape? Should young girls risk their own lives for something they did not even consent to?    What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?    Death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives. At war, soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die. So, human beings are given the right to kill others.   I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?    You did not state any proof. You only quoted doctors who agree with you.   I have one last question: Do the rights of an embryo outweigh the rights of woman?",1

Why does everyone state passages from the bible as if it hold some authority on the topic. Most people do not subscribe to the validity of your old books on any topic so please stop using it to try and convince people of your perspective.,1
"1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.  2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.  3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is  always  something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is  not  a party. But it's  their  choice, something  they  have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that ""if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen"" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.  As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the ""child"" only because the ""child"" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.  4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a  fact  the earth is round for example. Some have the ""opinion"" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not  that  big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is  not  upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.  Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.  Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.  2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.  That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice.",1
"if mother does not care about her future child and wants to make an abortion, she should think about herself because, there are 2 types of abortion: safe and unsafe   annually, 500 million women of childbearing age who die from causes related to pregnancy, 15% of deaths due to complications of unsafe abortion  I'm personally against abortion",0
"Sure the law protects you to have your own beliefs, but what gives you the right to force your beliefs on others?

No one is saying you don't have a right to your opinion, but if you don't want your views challenged, don't come on a debate website.",1
"That is Old testament life was more strict back then but if you have ""read"" the New Testament in the Bible you would have learned we are all set free from the Old Testament.     No you aren't.

"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.  Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?  If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.  You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned",0

"The ""baby"" is not yet a baby. It's only a POTENTIAL life and not an ACTUAL life. So you're not killing a baby.

Have you ever heard of Tiller…the doctor that was killed for doing late term abortions? He did them like this as do clinics all over the country.

"Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   I don't care what the Bible says God forgives and doesn't forgive. Plenty of other people don't, either.   But, just for fun:  http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   As abortion is currently legal, this is no longer an 'if' scenario. Some may say we are in dire straights as a country, but I doubt it is because the government places the rights of a conscious citizen above the interests of an unconscious fetus.   Additionally, it is judgmental and tunnel-visioned to assert that only stupid people get pregnant accidentally. Do not place yourself on a pedestal above people who find themselves in this situation.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   I think it would take a very strong mental constitution  not  to be psychologically harmed by carrying to term a pregnancy resulting from rape. I certainly admire the women who decide to do so, but women who decide not to do not deserve punishment; they deserve compassion and support because they have suffered enough.  There is no shortage of available orphans. A woman who chooses to have an abortion (for any reason, not just rape or health-related) is not cruelly ripping away some innocent stranger's dream of having a child.    When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   Earlier, it seems you implied abortion is acceptable if carrying the pregnancy to term will harm or kill the mother. Correct me if I am wrong and I will revise. Because it is for a reason you consider valid, it is no longer murder? If the answer is yes, it is still murder, why do you allow murder in some cases but not others? If the answer is no, it is no longer murder, why should your opinion be the determining one for deciding what is a valid reason to get an abortion?  She is not really stating facts, she is rambling incoherently, getting worked up, and ignoring opposing arguments. If you are her parent, you may want look around this site and see what the average discourse consists of, for the sake of both herself and the site. She may be a little young to participate.",1
I don't find it humorous. And you don't have any idea what factors go into someone else's decision to have or not have an abortion. Your imagination is not a relative argument.,1

"i believe so. the very fact that abortion has been put it shows that there is a need for it. the various circumstances of the individuals requiring abortion differs greatly; a young couple having made a mistake, a couple with financial problems and cannot cope with another child, rape victims, the list goes on. while there are circumstances when one does not deserve to have an abortion, but the child that is born will suffer the consequences of its parents mistakes. Banning abortion is like imposing the death sentence on youths using drugs.",1
"Ok, really?  You could have just kept this to yourself. I say these types of things in my head when I read some debates but, I don't post it.  Alright, let me put it this way. Once a human  ""organism""  is made it is alive. Whither people like it or not it is fact that it is alive.  It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks.  Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?",0
But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion. Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive. Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born?,0
"Oh! You were being sarcastic! Hahahahaha! You actually didn't mean for people to pull out fetuses and wave it in front of people's faces while yelling ""Check this out!!!""??? Wow, I actually thought you meant that seriously... Boy, was I wrong!",1
It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working? If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?  It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases. Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion. Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us. And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.,0
"""Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?""   Is this a quantifiable statement. Are we capable of saying that 2 minutes after conception, that bundle of 8 or so cells is not just a human being, but has an intangible ""soul"". And those toe nails i just clipped that are made up of millions of cells, or if a hair gets plucked along with the root that still has a lot more than 8 cells, those have souls too? At what point is the now separate entity no longer ""you""?  If one wears protections, is that not killing potential for having something with a ""soul""? Or is the woman's period also murder because it also is killing the potential for a new human being?   ""So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.  And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?  Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.""   I really don't understand how it's possible to say that a human being, having been alive, having consciousness, can be compared (even in a drugged stupor) to a collection of relatively inanimate bunches of cells. I agree that at a certain point, when the fetus has begun to kick and to show brain activity, that it is now murder to have an abortion. But up until that point, I believe the mother has a right to terminate the pregnancy.  Additionally, you are forming your opinion based on an assumption that all accidental pregnancies happen through laziness. But what if the child has some terrible genetic disease that will render their life to be agonizing. I remember someone referenced a disease on CD where the baby lives for about an hour after birth in terrible pain. Wouldn't it then be mercy then to prevent this from happening before the bunch of cells has become conscious? Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest, and she got pregnant. I doubt that she would love this child if she carried it to term, and so the child would probably be emotionally malnourished the rest of its life. Would you want to sentence someone to that kind of life?  Another way of looking at is, okay the courts and legislature have agreed to your point of view. Abortions are now illegal. However, that does not mean that people wanting abortions aren't going to happen, and it also doesn't mean that people will stop getting abortions. Women who don't want to or can't carry a child to term will be forced to go to back alley doctors to perform the abortion (or perhaps worse, try to do it themselves) and those unqualified doctors' abortions could lead to their own death in addition to the fetus'. Also, those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them. They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby. Even when abortion is legal, this kind of stuff happens too much, and imagine how much worse it would be if abortion by qualified doctors was illegal.",1
"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.  Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.  Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.    Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.  Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. WORDS: 981",0
"Christ mate, do you want a medal or something?  Don't be so dramatic over a debate, you weren't aborted and that's why you're here. Be thankful, because all other aborted fetuses certainly cannot.",0
"You do make a valid point there, but I feel like the ""pain"" involved could be considered spiritual pain or even emotional pain to the mother. I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion. And at conception, that little tiny zygote has a soul. Our souls define who we are and I think it's immoral to destroy a life with an innocent soul. In the other debate I only really mention the adverse effects of killing in a physical sense. That;s because when I think of the word kill, I immediately think of murdering an adult and I suppose those reasons are the reasons why many animals do not kill their own species.  Besides, aborting a baby at any stage is not acceptable, by my standards, because the mother (or whomever decided to abort) is not giving that baby a chance at life. Who knows whether or not that baby could have become the next Albert Einstein or the next Adolf Hitler.   All I know is that it does cause pain. I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting. Is that not pain? And if you think about it, it does damage the population. With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual. This decreases genetic variation in the gene pool.",0
"There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.  Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.   Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.   The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.",0
"The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.   To quote you, who cares what is legal and not legal? Laws change all the time. I do not consider it a criminal activity for a woman to choose to have sex in exchange for money; I consider it another example of religious moral being passed into law. However, this is a different debate topic.    I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship.   Okay. I am going to try one more time to explain to you in simple terms why the mother-fetus relationship is parasitic. This is the last time I am going to try to explain it. If you do not understand after this, I will not address the point again; this does not mean I am assuming I am correct by virtue of ending the argument, just that I have thoroughly exhausted all the evidence there is, only to have it ignored by you, and I am not longer going to waste time on it.  When two organisms interact on a biological level, they enter a symbiotic relationship. This relationship can be mutual, commensal, or parasitic. Mutual relationships are relationships in which both organisms involved reap a benefit. Commensal relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits, and the other is not affected at all. Parasitic relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits at the expense of the other organism. (Source:  http://adventuresinscience.edublogs.org/                                     2009/05/20/symbiosis/)  )  Now, pick the relationship that describes the mother-fetus interaction: Mutualism, commensalism, or parasitism.   Additionally, here are several sources that do not add the stipulation of species to the definition or parasite. Note that these are not simply English dictionaries, but biological dictionaries intended to define terms as they can be used in a scientific context.    http://biology-online.org/dictionary/ Parasite     http://en.mimi.hu/biology/parasite.html    http://www.wordiq.com/definition/ Parasite     http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=4769     So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life.    It's the human life part you seem to be having a problem with. Yes, the fetus is alive, and it has human DNA, but I think it is foolish to place its life on the same level as, say, an actual baby. To do so is to say abortion is identical to the murder of a 6 month old baby.    Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   If another organism (human or not) is using a human being as a life support system, the human that is functioning as a life support system has a right to order the end of such a relationship. In your example, the man you are about to shoot is perfectly capable of living without using your body; if you wish to end your involvement with him, you can walk away. A woman who wants to get an abortion does not have this luxury, so the situations are incomparable in that respect. I posed a hypothetical situation in a previous post that I believe you also ignored:  Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of charging them with murder if they do not? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.   The homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America because a fetus is not legally considered a human life. Do you live in country where they do, or do you live in fantasy America?   I also fail to see how my use of the term 'fetus' means that the law suddenly applies to it.    But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.   You do realize that I am not arguing that the fetus is dead, right?   So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.   It is nonsensical to imply that anyone wants to kill a fetus  because  it will develop into a human being. People get abortions because they do not want to be pregnant, and pregnancy should be a voluntary process. If there was a way in which the pregnancy could be terminated and the fetus preserved, that would be ideal. As it is, no such thing exists, the interests of a fully developed and conscious human being should override the interests of a fetus that has no more consciousness than a human lung.   NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.   Even the accidental loss of human life merits an investigation, and it is quite possible to purposefully induce a miscarriage through many avenues. If a fetus is placed on the same level as a human being, then women who miscarried should be immediately subjected to an investigation and arrested for murder if it was determined she is at least partially responsible for the miscarriage, either through intention or negligence.",1
"I love when someone says what you just did in your post.   You don't care if they kill....in your mind its moral.........but  there should be a limit as to how many THEY CAN KILL.   LMAO  Honey, abortion is a form of birth control for a lot of women.",0
"You forget that she's from the UK. The British don't tend to randomly share such personal information with random people, whether it's kidnehy surgery or abortion. (Yes, that stereotype was satirically intended for the purpose of pointing out that her country is different then ours.)  That's hypocritical for you to say. In fact, that's contradictory. ;) If the circumstances don't matter to you, then the circumstance of the mother dying on the table shouldn't matter either. You're a big fat hypocrite. REAL pro-life people I've talked to think the mother should  die .  Circumstance is the only thing that matters in anything, ever. If you value  all  life, then you are an idiot. If you value all  human  life, then you're supposed to treat them with empathic logic, the only logic of morality. People are numbers in the end. If you don't treat them like numbers and instead like individuals, more will be lost then gained. You can't just say that it's right to let the mother die because abortion is murder, because that, by definition, is incentive to murder. If you value all  human  life, you can't say that euthanazia is right, but letting a mother die in childbirth is euthanazia. According to your logic, you'd have to choose in between murder and murder.   And that's why circumstance is the only factor that matters.   What if a doctor like you is in that situation described above? What is he supposed to do? What he's SUPPOSED to do is abandon your false logic! It is not logic because it does not factor in the unpredictable variable that is circumstance! If you want to do the right thing, you have to think of everyone and everything as a whole, not  one  specific factor in the equation! You can't solve for x in an xy equation without also solving for y!   Your logic tries to solve for  just  x.  As you can see, that is impossible. That's why I don't agree with either radical side of this debate. If you really care about people and life, neither should you.",1

"A teenagers brain (especially in this 'politically correct society'), is crazy. Its crazy for sex 24 hours a day. When I was a kid I used to beat my poor thing to death three a day. Without correct sexual education, a teenager will go into the world blind about the dangers of sex (you can thank your friendly neighbourhood church and its opal ring ""abstinence"" crusade for that slip-up). So I do agree on what you say, ""society be responsible for a females irresponsibility"".  But when it happens, you cant look retrospectivly, you have to look forward. As a teen mother, you cant be given advice such as, ""you should have been more carefull"", when its already happend. So family planning and all that crap can go out the window.  As for financial planning goes, 16-24 years of age for a young woman is the prime age for develpment in educational areas which will one day solidify that persons job stability and stable income. I dont think that their first option should be to suddenly drop everything and take up the cash register at burger king, thats a sure-fire way to ruin two peoples lives! A woman should asspire to greater things in life rather than paying the rest of her life for a mistake which chould have been fixed with one easy pill, injection, baby-killing device or whatever.   I would not liek to see our kind of society (sex crazed maniacs) without abortion. Young teenagers lives in ruins and the detromental affects it will have to the next generation of disfunctional youths. You have to realize what a young child growing up in a fatherless household is like. His/her mother working 12 hour shifts at a fast food outlet just to keep the shanty roof over their heads. He will grow up in a bum neighbour-hood full of gangs and crack-fiends and eventually become one himself.",1

None of what you say in any way points toward any kind of self-awareness. Science says it's not a baby, and nothing you said will stop a single abortion from happening.  So stop, find another cause. Abortions have been going on since the beginning of time and all this foaming-at-the-mouth zealous ignorance has never stopped a single one. Every time in history you zealous foaming-at-the-mouth looney tunes have gotten your way and made abortion illegal it has lead to nothing but a bunch of dead little girls from botched abortions, and still not a single abortion is ever stopped.  If  you  don't want an abortion,  you  don't have to get one. But if some poor young girl thinks that's her best option, then that's  her  choice.  If god or whoever doesn't like it, then he can come down here and tell her himself.  Stay out of it.",1
"""We don't even abort animals like we do our own human children""  As a former veterinary technician, I can tell you that you're quite mistaken. Many dogs and cats are brought into the vets office to be ""spayed"" in late stages of pregnancy. The pups/kits that are removed with the uterus are usually killed immediately by breaking their necks or by lethal injection. Horrific, yes it is. But beats the heck out of the alternative, having even more unwanted pets in the streets and shelters.   I don't like having to choose a side that says ""abortion is right"" because I don't think it is. But I do absolutely believe in the right of a woman to choose an abortion if she and her doctor believe it is the best choice for her. Sometimes an abortion is the lesser of two evils - and I don't think anyone but a woman and her doctor should be allowed to make that decision for her.",1
No they don't. Maybe if they had an appendix removed. But there as so many minor operations people don't talk about because it's  personal .

"I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like ""it will ruin your life"" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?",0

"""It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks.  Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?""  Absolutely, and I think that most of us on the pro-choice side would agree that a woman's right to chose ends by the time a fetus reaches the stage where it eats or thinks.

"Ah, now we get to the core of your argument. Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making? So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies? Gay sex is wrong, then? Or sex between infertile married couples? Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality. Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others.   Your statement that ""sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties"" is laughable. Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships. Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong. What effect am I numb to? Orgasm? Hardly.   ""It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting""--like a parasite? So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months.   Stop trying to relate my examples to murder. You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person.   You claim that adoption is the ""only ethical choice"" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion. 1-Addicts  cannot  bring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption. It also assumes that there would be enough of a ""market"" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned. Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise?   Prohibition never works. Prohibition on alcohol didn't work. Prohibition on marijuana is not working. Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work. Prohibition fails. Period.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex"". We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible. I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it.   Did you bother reading the study I linked to? I'll reiterate the key points of their findings.  1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity.    So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them. Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative. If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it? To appease your moral beliefs? Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals. They are about people. And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it. Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love.   I suggest this. Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex. But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex. Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them. Wouldn't you rather they fall without HIV? Or an unwanted pregnancy?",1

"From my atheist perspective, I can't even catch a glimpse of the logic behind any rejection of abortion.

"I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   With conjoined twins, the ownership of the body can be disputed. They share bones and organs; it is not a clear-cut case of one separate but dependent organism residing in another. I know there is physiological variation with conjoined twins, but take Abigail and Brittany Hensel as an example:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel    How can one sister make a claim to the shared organs at the expense of the other sister? They own them equally. I don't believe a fetus can be said to own any part of the mother's body  at all , much as less as much as the mother does.  Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved. Except, in the case of abortion, the benefiting party is not a person yet.",1

Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.  Fruit were evolved to be eaten.  I shall cite a reference for you...  ''In biology (botany), a ""fruit"" is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries. Taken strictly, this definition excludes many structures that are ""fruits"" in the common sense of the term, such as those produced by non-flowering plants (like juniper berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers[1]), and fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues close to the fruit (accessory fruit, or more rarely false fruit or pseudocarp), such as cashew fruits. Often the botanical fruit is only part of the common fruit, or is merely adjacent to it. On the other hand, the botanical sense includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, tomatoes, and many more. However, there are several variants of the biological definition of fruit that emphasize different aspects of the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits.[2]''  Wiki - Fruit  You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.",0
"It really is the mother's decision. If she isn't wanting to take care of it who will? Yes the father maybe... but what if your raped, what if you didnt want the baby and the husband altered the birthcontrol pills into something else. Yes you could put it into an adoption agency, but what if they grow up wonderign why there parents gave them up? They would feel like crap thinking that there parents hated them, and be suicidel. No one deserves the live of bouncing around in foster homes, thinking no one loves them. They may get into a caring family but do you know how many kids get into crappy situations? It is the persons decisions, we souldnt have a law saying this is a bad thing to do. Its a moral and a value we all have and we all have different views. why should we care about what other people do with there lives. especally people we dont even know.",1
"Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage.   Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse. It takes TWO people to make sex. So,  you  not having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well.   It would require both parties abstain to attain the ""high sexual standards"" you propose setting. What are our current sexual standards by comparison?   As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins. As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement.",1

"Lots of parts in the Bible are literal but there are that have a different meaning then what stands out. Jesus said a lot of parables that contained a specific meaning.

Being a Christian has nothing to do with it. I don't have your prejudice and theological blindness, and that is why I don't dismiss scripture that I find inconvenient, like you do. What Jesus said was quite clear but you continue to ignore it because you don't like the outcome of it being true.

"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",1
"I am so on the basis of Natural Rights. At some point, the living thing inside a woman's womb becomes a human being. I do not believe this to be at conception, and I cannot define exactly when that point is. But it is fairly clear to me that it is not one instant before birth. My daughter was born six weeks premature. If she had not been premature, would it have been legitimate to abort her two weeks later? Would it be legitimate for a woman to delay labor via drugs and have her baby aborted past the time it was actually due? And finally, most late-term abortions amount to clear infanticide, as the baby is actually living outside of the womb before it is killed. Must I accept this in order to be ""pro-choice"" in your eyes? Must I oppose a first-trimester abortion of a rape or incest victim in order to be ""pro-life""?  You make the argument that ""pro-life"" people should be for legal abortion, since legal abortion leads to fewer abortions and deaths of mothers having abortions. I question these data. Most of the countries where abortion is illegal are poorer and have other problems -- it is thus hard to isolate the effect of abortion laws on abortion rates.  But, for the sake of argument, let's say you are right: Would this then also justify any other crime? What if the legalization of murdering one person a year was demonstrated to reduce the total number of violent crimes -- could it be justified? You are using utilitarian ethics, whereas many non-religious and some religious abortion opponents use Natural Rights ethics. Utilitarianism allows for any abrogation of rights if it can be seen as being ""in the common good,"" whereas Natural Rights allow for no such abrogations. There is nothing hypocritical about being a Natural Rights-based opponent of abortion.",0
"Give me the link again, and if it doesn't have evidence that a newly fertilized egg has a human  soul , then you're lying. Saying something is a human being based on the flesh is not scientific, meaning you're full of opinionated shit. And so is the ""scientist"".  I have obviously done far more research on this topic then you, since you are content with sitting on a radical belief. It doesn't matter if something is alive, that does not make it human. A mushroom is alive. Grass is alive. But we still step on mushrooms and mow our lawns.  You haven't been listening to my point from the beginning. You don't listen... listen listen listen. I know exactly what the pro-life stance on abortion is, but you know nothing about what my stance is, because you obviously have not been paying attention even slightly. That, or you're completely insane.  There is a moral middle ground for  everything . I am not sitting on the fence. I am not pro-abortion because I don't believe in abortion after a certain stage in the pregnancy. Who the heck am I? No one. But a doctor can tell her when her fetus has  brain waves . A doctor can tell her, therefore, when a fetus is a  conscious human being . If she cannot see the logical difference between killing something that is conscious and something that is not conscious, then I would never trust her to know what the difference is between smashing a rock and killing a newborn baby. So no, it's not personally what I think even a little. It's basic logic that you seem to lack or deny out of faulty religious principle.   I am going to point this out one last time about my observations over abortion:  science does not prove that a human soul beings at conception . Science does, on the other hand, prove that a consciousness emerges at a certain stage in the pregnancy. The soul is not measured by existence, it is measured by the brain, by the conscious being. To say that a human has a soul because it's flesh exists is like saying that an  ant  has a soul because it crawls on your kitchen floor, but that's not going to stop you from  murdering it with Raid .   This is very balanced thinking. The fact that I don't believe in the mother's rights after a certain point instead of at all times means I am not one-sided, like you. If I am not one-sided, then what am I? I'm in between the two radical opinions because neither of them is balanced. Pro-choice is hypocritical and pro-life is hypocritical. Both are illogical because neither factor in circumstance. You want to know why my observations of abortion are so confusingly in between? Because I factor in circumstance and humanity. You do not.   I have not once disputed that a fetus is not alive, I have disputed that it is not human until a certain point. So, I'm going to say this one last time:  you have yet to prove that a fetus is human before is has a consciousness . You dodge and you block and you spew meaningless jargon at me that has no relation to anything I'm saying. You haven't proved me wrong once;  once .  Now stop spewing crap at me and explain why a fetus,  logically , has a soul at every stage of the pregnancy, consciousness or not. Only when you can  logically  prove that a fetus has a soul before it has a consciousness that you will ever come anywhere near proving me wrong.   So far, you have said nothing that means anything towards disputing me. Maybe you're dumbfounded and not paying attention to a single word I'm saying. But I've pretty much explained it thoroughly, so if you can't get it this time, it's obvious that you're extremely slow.",1
"well, it is a bad decision to have abortion. even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life.. it is cruel and such an evil thing to do.. and i am pretty sure its not our body but in soul were all connected and we never said it was ours to begin with.. your babies are human and deserved to be loved also.. how will they ever know if you end their lives.",0
I believe that abortion is completely acceptable because if you get one it is just like a man masturbating and a woman going through her menstrual period except for the fact that the egg and sperm have come together.,1

"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person. Sure, the starving and innocent in South America deserve support, but first we need to get our country better off so that we can afford the massive donations to infrastructure.",1
"FYI  The question is not who did or didn't do this or that. The question is should abortion be banned. I say it already is. We already have laws against murder; it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual. Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution.   Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong. And if it is within in your power to stop it and you don't; you are just as guilty, regardless of your political affiliation.",0
The father's decision or the mother's decision? What does it have to do with the fact that it should be banned or not? This is a NON-ARGUMENT.,1

"I am 20, polyamorous and a virgin. Our society is not sex crazed.   It is at a minimum 16 or 18 years to raise a kid(possibly less), at most a life time.   A teen mother is dependent on her own mother. she is in no economic situation to even raise herself. She is burdening her network of support, but given proper support can indeed get a education and a wonderful life.   my dad is more of a provider then a father. At times it seems like he might as well not even be there. Good friends of mine have grown up in motherless houses, split between parents and in fatherless houses. A nuclear family is not proven to be best. All my friends are quite well as am myself. Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.   It should also be noted a teenage mother is only a teenager for so long. One of my best friends girl-friends was a teenage mom(and now just a mom), another one of my best friends ex-girlfriends became pregnant by another man shortly after they broke up and is either 16 or 17. I have seen these women and their situation and i fully believe that they still possess every opportunity in the world if not more then they would have not being a mother.

If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.   Two answers to that:  Put the baby up for adoption.  Leave the baby at a firestation.

So you are saying a fetus is not human and it is undeserving to live and yet we were all once a fetus and we are living. Abortion is depriving that human of experiencing life.,0
"This is a speech that i found:  On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.  Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.  Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.  The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.  Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.  The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.  In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.",1

Think about that for a moment. Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain, but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain. In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells. This isn't the same as killing infants or babies, so you need to learn more about it and divorce yourself from that mindset.",1
"A fetus is not yet a child. It is the product of the woman's body despite it  being viable future offspring. And although males have a stake in this  creation of life they are not the ones who have to take the risks of bearing  children. Pregnancy is a very risky situation for women and I think the  pro-life camp takes this very lightly. Women are responsible for bringing  life into this world, however that responsibility falls into each and everyone  of their hands. Every woman should have the right to decide what's best  for her health. After all it's her body and not yours.",1
"Ok what about women who are raped? This is a violent act for sure. But are two acts of violence better than one? I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being. It is not given a sedative...it is ripped, burned and dismembered while the heart beats, when it quite possibly is moving. So how is the act of rape the new living childs fault? If you walked into a nursery in a hospital and the nurse told you that one out of the ten babies theres mother was raped...do you think you could pick it out? No....it has just as much right to life as the child whose mother was not raped. The mother who was raped not only will remember the rape, but the day she...took it upon herself to kill another living person. So if you value life........you value all life and you give it a chance.   You bring up the death penalty.....I am not pro-death penalty...I do believe in prison however...and not prisons with television, internet, and work out rooms.   I did give proof some of the top doctors around the world, researchers...I mean what more do you want? Many of these doctors testified in front of the Senate on when life begins.   And your last question.....  I believe that women know when they have sex they might become pregnant, even if they take precautions. I believe that when a life is started...that that life should be allowed to be born. Nine months is not that long when you know it can save another living persons life. There is always adoption. What is nine months...compared to killing?   This is about doing what is right, not only for the woman but the life growing inside her...that she help start. I do not believe woman should have the right to kill.   You however believe that she does, because IT IS HER BODY. And that right should not be taken away or controlled by anyone else. So let me ask you this......  If the woman wanted to abort in the ninth month, eighth month this would and should be her right.....you certainly would not want her to be enslaved by a baby even in late term........right?   You cant have it both ways.",0
"Abortion rights are being abused.  It should not be looked at like an easy form of contaception.  ""People ought to abstain from sex or practise safe sex.""  Yeah ive heard that argument before ,  However;  Abortion is a serious matter and unfortunately there are cases in which an abortion is neccesary;   http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9603/ articles/goodwin.html",1
Abortion should be legal for it is ultimately the Mother's choice.  Don't criticize just because you're not going to be that poor unfortunate 16 year old girl who can't go to college and pursue her dreams because of a mistake.  Don't criticize because you're not the future father who is stuck paying welfare for 18 years.,1

abortion should be a womans choice. once a certain time period has passed threw the pregnacny then it should not occur. but why bring a child into the world that someone does not want. just for it to be put in an adoption home to spend the rest of its life knowing that mommmy and daddy didnt want them. in my opinion its way better to prevent the suffering & over population.,1
"Who is the woman (or anyone) to say that this baby will not be able to make any choices? What about this potential persons life? What about his or her choices?  And don't start with the whole ""it's not a person yet"" thing BECAUSE if you left whatever it is alone it would be a person within a few short months anyways! This is about potential. This is about choice. This is about Life.    ""Why is this even being discussed in society, really?""   You're so enclosed in your own biased self centered state that you admittedly can't even  comprehend  why the topic of the life of another person is up for discussion?    ""Whatever happened to freedom of property, expression and religion?""    You're  the one suggesting that an unborn child shouldn't get a shot at any of those three things if it so be that he or she ends up with an irresponsible parent. What about his or her freedom of property, expression, or religion?",1

"In the case of paralyzed or comatose patients, if a caretaker becomes unhappy with the situation, they are legally allowed to quit or otherwise cease their involvement. This is also not an issue of bodily autonomy.  The only evidence I need for the parasitism of the fetus is the definition of the word parasite: an organism that lives inside another organism (its host) and siphons resources without reciprocation. The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so. You should be permitted to decide what medical procedures you will undergo or forego. If you do not get to decide this, then your rights to bodily autonomy are being infringed upon. When the interests of the fetus and the mother collide, the mother should take precedence.   This, more than a lack of consciousness in the fetus, is why I support abortion at the discretion of the mother and no one else.",1
"Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation.   What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal, and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased, especially since the 80s. And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.   At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.   At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells. Depending on the week or trimester, a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli, and therefore cannot be murdered or killed.   But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion.   No, it doesn't. A zygote isn't a ""class of people"", it isn't even a person yet. There are more murders   My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.   So? Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal.",1

"Katie, with all due respect, have you ever considered that legal abortions result in thousands of deaths...every week? Far more then when it is illegal. Humans after all come in many sizes....Don't you agree it's time to stop the mass-death-business of abortion? Drs make much faster money destroying life than delivering it. One takes nine mos. and many hours of labor... the other takes only a few minutes. Which do you think might attract the more talented , dedicated and professional Drs ? Can you even call them that when their purpose is to kill very little humans for big money, so people will not be inconvenienced ? ""Hit"" men might be a better name, based on what they truly do ""legally"". There are many loving people waiting to adopt, as you can plainly see in most news paper ads and by contacting any adoption agency. Should the innocent little ones CONTINUE to pay, for ""life""styles, IE ""death""styles?The abuse called Slavery ( which also made life more convenient for the ones in power)CHANGED thankfully, and which situation is really worse ?? So, there is hope that the ultimate child abuse and then killing of unborn babies in abortion will be stopped. Science makes it crystal clear now that this little life is a human being,and not an eagle etc. If however you kill an eagle egg there will likely be a fine !!",0
"Is it not wrong for a person to decide if another's life is worth while? I would of reckoned that is for each individual to decide.   If someone is using your body as a life support machine, don't you think you should have the right to decide if they continue to do so? Even if that person is your own offspring, even if that person is a completely self-aware adult, your body should not be used for anything against your ongoing permission. If physical autonomy is less important than another human's life, then the door is opened for things like government mandated organ donation.",1

If there were a nationwide poll and we were allowed to vote.....1/ woman can choose 2/abortion illegal with stipulations....she was dying............which one would you choose?

"One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?  So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well? Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.  Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus? Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?  Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?   But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with? Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.",0
"First of all, you further the previous point made about disinformation in how the quote you posted uses 'she' instead of 'they', attempting to personify the foetus further than it should be.   The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive   Every single part of your body can be considered alive, except your nails and hair and a few others, I believe. Cutting off a piece of skin holds no moral issues for you, I would guess, it's a similar idea. Except a foetus will cost thousands of pounds/dollars/euros, will take thousands of hours of time, will restrict you throughout your entire life, cause you to be labelled because of it, and cause you to endure a huge amount of hardship from it. There are reasons for abortion as well, studies have shown that about three quarters of women choose them because of financial reasons, hardly their choice.   Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it   I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.   Actually, humans kill thousands of life forms every single second, just because it's seen as morally wrong there is a big issue with abortion. Why should it be morally wrong? Please give me a reason why it is so intrinsically bad to take a life with no emotion?  I would suggest that Pro-Lifer's are not necessarily blind to truth, they see it, they simply ignore the truth of what happens to those who are not allowed abortions. Abortion rates does not change massively when it is outlawed, all that happens is they do it illegally and unsafely. Further, the argument made by Republican candidates is that abortion should be outlawed to protect the 'nuclear family'. Hardly relevant, as typical, married, happy, nuclear families would not get abortions a significant amount of the time. Give me a convincing argument as to why abortion is so bad.",1
"1. I was talking specifically about placing a child into the adoption system. Learn to read. I don't have a problem with ditching something. The problem as I see it is when a mother would sooner impose a life of lovelessness and misery onto her child than to just terminate it's life.   If YOU personally think it's okay to make other persons miserable so long as it keeps your conscience clear, fine, but that makes you an egotistical asshole to me.  2. Given logic as the means to decide who is correct, she is objectively wrong in a factual manner.  3. You don't even know my disputes. You're writing me off before you even know why the bible is garbage, this is a logical fallacy on your part.  4. No, by definition ""humans"" are a species. Biology 101. Look it up.  5. How is this contradictory to what I wrote? You're statement was still non-cognitive opinion. Besides, you're ""God"" aborts far more babies than humans do.  6. What colour is the sky in your fantasy world? Just because persons are allowed to get abortions doesn't mean they necessarily will. Lots of mothers place their children up for adoption despite being allowed to abort the fetus, hence the surplus of orphans.  7. No, you've decided it's your business because you're an egotistical hypocrite. You don't automatically have the ""right"" to force others to conform to your personal preferences just because others don't agree with you.  8. Well you were wrong. Don't worry, I'm sure God will forgive you for your prejudice nature. ;)  9. ""XD"" is a laughing emoticon. Welcome to the Internet.   I didn't even use a single negative, so you're comment makes no sense what so ever.   10. A mother who truly loves their child will abort it if she can't support it. There's already enough persons in the world. The only reason why mothers who otherwise would get abortions DON'T is because of the guilt your dogma imposes on them. Therefore they aren't choosing to not abort the fetus out of love, they're doing it out of guilt.",1
"I'm very against abortion, but I'm not stupid; I know there are times where it is a necessity. I think it should ultimately stay legal, but should be a lot more restricted. I don't see anything good from a 25-year-old going in and getting an abortion because she just doesn't want the baby.",0

"Lets make this quick.   ""Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive""  Worlds most spurious argument? You have absolutely zero evidence to support that statement. You can’t honestly believe a bunch of diagrams on penises and how babies are made can incite sexual fantasies! Teens are naturally sexual, it’s called puberty which answers my next point.  ""At the age of 11 at that""  You hadn't even hit puberty so no wonder you weren’t thinking about sex. I’m just glad sex-ed kicked in before the hormones. Think about this, do you think it benefits society to keep kids totally in the dark about sex till there an adult or to educate them about the right and wrong way to have sex.  ""We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. ""  Yes what the teachers are told you are purely opinion based and I believe should be left for the parents.  ""Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity.""  That’s foolish, again no evidence for this proclamation. Promiscuity is a much sensationalized word and it always used in a bad light. However it is just a word to describe a human’s need for sexual gratification. What they are saying totally makes sense, if you love someone and sleep with them, you aren’t as likely to go out and cheat on them.  Promiscuous: characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association, esp. having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.   If your teachers say you should love the person you’re sleeping with then they are discouraging promiscuity...........  ""People should learn from their mistakes.""  Mate I totally agree with you on that one but what I was saying before was that society won’t help our teen parents with that kind of attitude. They should be supporting them instead.   ""Doesn’t actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job""  Obviously you can’t deter someone from a crime they have already committed... It is clear that a teenager finding out she is pregnant is the most devastating news; it is life changing. I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.",1

"Abortion is a really common thing nowaday and not a lot of people seem to be bothered by that idea, just because of how usual it has become.   I have an ""against"" point of view, just because I don't think that abortion is an exit from a situation whe you are pregnant, it can not be that easy. Before a girl should think about things to prevent unwanted pregnancy. There are a lot of pills, birthcontrols and some kind of technological equipments which may help without harming young girl's organism. Secondly I don't find it morally impoverished. It's basically a murder. Just think of it! Every day there are a lot of embryos thrown into huge garbage bins. Those were supposed t be future children and just because of silly ""parents"" they weren't given a chance to live. I don't know, maybe time passes by and I'll understand it sometime, someday, but not right now. For now it's something that gives me a big feeling of disgust.",0

"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.",1

Abortion is invariably the decision of the woman because it is her body whether if the sex was consensual or rape. The government nor the Church has any right telling what a woman should do with her body. Abortion is acceptable because a fetus is not a baby.,1
I'm personally against abortion.  We must look at the reasons women have abortions. In general it has to do with irresponsibility. Very rarely the reasons are medical or rape. Should society be responsible for a females irresponsibility?  Another problem I have is the availability. The first thought that comes to the mind is abortion. If the couple feel they will have financial difficulties - abortion is the first answer. Not improving their home economics or getting better jobs. Abortion should always be the last action - not the first.  However in this society I don't think we can live without abortion. It's like coffee - we don't need it.. but we choose to be controlled by it. So if we are to keep it - it should be heavily regulated.,0
"As a woman who does not hold a religious stance on this but rather a personal experience stance, I think my argument holds a lot of water.   I had an abortion. I regret it deeply. I am older now and realize how selfish of a decision it was. I think because we can't see or hold or converse with the life, it is easy to dismiss but, I ALSO, almost did it again, 3 years later. I had two children already and had been basically tricked into a pregnancy I did not want. My boys were older, I had my life together and did not want another child. The issue was pushed by my partner and I was given an ultimatum. I got pregnant and he left 8 weeks into it. I was backed against a wall, scared, confused. How would I care for 3 children alone? I made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas ( hours and hours from where I lived. ) Once there I broke down in the parking lot and drove all the way home. I went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a gorgeous little girl, met a guy that has been her dad for the last 5 years and I am reminded everytime I look at her, that the only thing that separated her from death was my unwillingness to walk up a flight of stairs. She almost wasn't here... so close. She also reminds me of the who isn't here because of a selfish decision I made. I like how so many people forget about adoption as an option...just like I did.

"My point is you're forced to rely on your spouse having been a virgin prior to marriage as well. And you'll really only ever be 100% sure of your own sexual history. So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence. For life.   There is certainly question to when life begins. You say it's life throughout. What marks the beginning stage then? The question is  not  what kind of life. What does that even mean?   And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor. Nice try. Your neighbor  is  a fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months. Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children.   I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work.",1
"Even if it was.   You sound sceptical. Why?   Your statement was rude and counterproductive.   I think it was harsh, not rude. But maybe we have a different threshold for rudeness. I don't think it was counter-productive. It certainly got your attention. However, if we were going to enter into such a petty debate, it would indeed be counterproductive.   No it takes into account that most abortions are not due to medical necessity.   This is argumentum ad populum. Even if this  was  true, it doesn't necessarily mean that abortion  ought  not to be legal.

Ah, but what a decent person does is ask for clarification, isn't it?   I didn't claim they all were.   You didn't say they weren't. All you asserted was that abortion is an unnecessary surgery.   Well they are certainly not given a burial   So what? A child could be killed by a parent through abuse and still be given a proper. In such a case, does it mean that just because the child was given a proper burial it necessarily meant that he/she wasn't treated like trash?",0
you are so dumb look in greys anatomy book of life if you have all your organs are breathing or have a heartbeat you are considered living erg should i shoot you cuz your obviously not a human being if you could kill your own child without a second thought,0
if you keep abortion legal than you should make murder legal. if you can chose you don't want you baby alive than you should chose that you don't want someone else to be alive and kill them. it is all the same and what kind of world would this be if murder was legal.,0
Thank you for making that point. So infact we don't know what accomplishments these unborn can make but yet we want to abort them?

Babies can be seen silently screaming during an abortion. What does that tell you?,0
"She has a right to unhook herself...but she is not slaughtering the child. The child might die might not....nature takes it course.  The fetus in the womb is not dying on its own its fine. The mother pays someone to kill it. This is totally different.   So since you are pro-abortion....I assume you are pro-abortion since you do give the woman the right it is her body.....to kill it even after nine months.  Got one for ya. The woman is in scheduled for a csection in one week. She gets scared and decides that she does not want the baby. Is perfectly acceptable for her to kill it at nine months?  The woman took the risk that she might get pregnant. If she did not want a baby she should not have had sex, or done something to prevent it like sterilization.   And for your information the baby is not part of the mother. It has its own DNA, bodily systems, heart, circulatory system, fingerprints.

Abortion is wrong sure there are instances that people think that it is right but it never is you are taking a life away even if the baby is not alive yet you take away that oppertunity away if you say for instance get raped or the condom breaks give the baby up for adoption but still be apart of its life I have noticed that the people that say abortion is right are alive and their parents didnt go through an abortion,0
"Ok let me clarify,But let me say I'm not sure why you are pushing this point, but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that.  So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.   In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.   So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas. And the Husband and Wife should make the call, if circumstances necessitate it.",1
"Abstinence means to abstain. You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.  About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them. The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them. Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible. So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up. Hey kids will be kids, right? Come on. Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.  Also, giving condoms is giving permission. You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear. Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it. What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem. I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.  Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them. Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance. So, lets expect more out of kids and not less.",0
"What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex.   Just like how the Japanese chose to settle in Japan.

The definition you gave was not a scientific definition.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I said serious defect.   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for, if you have even bothered to distill my previous arguments. Therefore, I don't understand why you are rebutting me.   It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop.   So what? That was not my point. What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.",1

"Ok, if outlawing unprotected sex makes it go underground like the drug scene, you don't think the same will happen to abortion if you outlaw that? So many people have brought up the point that outlawing abortion doesn't make it go away, it simply makes the practice unsafe and much riskier.   You're contradicting your own points, so just leave it and relax your views a little bit.   You also agree that we should educate to prevent mistakes from occuring. That's already happening so we're not arguing about that.  You say it's too late to find out about an illegal activity after the consequences? How else can you find out about an illegal activity?

"Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it. The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.  I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.  But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death.

I LOVE how a person can go to jail for killing their household pets, but then it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child because it hasn't met someone's standards of ""It deserves to livee~""  I can support a person's decision on the matter when it is completely necessary, but all the people who think abortion is all right and good is just sick :/",0

"A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.",1

People all need to realize that if a baby is not going to make it, the mother is not going to make it, or both aren't going to make it through birth.

Man, you're really judgmental, aren't you. ;)  I don't particularly care if you find me selfish and ignorant, you have yet to give a relevant reason as to why abortion should be illegal.

I never even said anything remotely like that... -_-    You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts.   No, opinions should be built on RELEVANT facts. For example; I say you have made the logical fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"" this is a fact. You say ""Woma have died from abortions, therefore abortion should be wrong"" This is also a fact, it just isn't a relevant one. And if your argument is based on fallacies and irrelevant facts &gt;&gt;YOU ARE WRONG&lt;&lt;   Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy.   ... Do you think I care? Really? Let them read it. I'll debate them too if they carry your idiocy with them.   I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.   And are they all ""pro-life"" too? If so, I've nothing to worry about. ;)   You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance.    You're projecting again ;)   You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey.   Oh, I've thought about what you're trying to convey; I've just decided it's wrong relative to the topic is all, ;)   When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.   Again, I'm not against facts. I'm against your stupidity. I'm against the conclusions you've derived from these facts. Stop trying to pass the blame onto the facts, they can't change, but you sure as hell can.   And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.   ... And yet you have. Is your dunce cap on too tight or something?   There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute.   Man, it takes a lot of repetition for you to learn, doesn't it? I never said you can't use these things, hell you may even win a debate with them if you're talking to someone even dumber than you (insert your own ""country full of idiots for you to talk to"" joke)... but when you're talking to someone intelligent enough to recognize a logical fallacy (e.g. Myself... and everyone else on this site) you're bound to get called out on it.  And, if you're entire argument is based on a fallacy, then you're wrong. Thus, you lose.   And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense.

"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument? You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right. Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact? The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.  Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone. Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case. And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself. Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you? Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.  If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?  Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion. Really? But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them? I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me.

If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?  Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.  You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.  Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.  Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.  And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning.

"If a woman/girl is in danger of dying from having a baby, and was either raped or unaware of the fact that she was having sex (because they have never been educated), then they should have the right to not get physically hurt from having the baby or waste 9 months of their life, having to take time off from work to care for a baby she will give up anyway–if it even survives. If she doesn't die from having the baby, she will still be in a position of a weaker person. She will be less fit, and might even lose her job because she had to take a maternity leave.  My mother was 26 when she got pregnant with her first child. My father and she were very happy–until 4 months in when she found out that her baby, who she had already named Sarah, had a severe heart condition, where even if it did survive past birth (less than 1% chance), would have serious handicaps its entire life. Is it fair to cause Sarah to feel complete pain and suffering her entire life? At least with the abortion that my mother got, Sarah could feel no pain. She wanted that baby more than anything or anyone else in the world, and her heart was broken that she could not deliver the joy to Sarah that Sarah had first given to her. For three years my mother did not try to have a baby again, and those three years were the hardest of her life.  I agree that it's horrible for a woman to abort a child because they can't afford it, or don't want it, in those cases they should put the baby up for adoption. But if the baby or the woman is in extreme danger, then the woman has the right to choose. If you honestly think that it could be legalized for rape, but not for anything else, then how would you judge if it were rape or not? Even if the person could get consent from a judge, by then the baby would be even closer to being born and have more nerves that could feel the pain. Abortion must be either legal or illegal, and it is unfair to cause people like my mother to have even more emotional suffering. So I cast my vote for abortion being legal.  P.S. I may only be a 14 year old boy, but I have extensive knowledge on political fronts and current events, and my education thus far has been one of the best available to a public school. It has also been scientifically proven that children on average can see the correct answers to problems more easily than adults if given the same amount of knowledge because they have less emotional backgrounds that will impair their logic.",1

I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description. People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society.

If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?  2.

"I'd like add a different perspective to your argument. I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.   The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.   Hope that clears things up for you.",0

"Alright, I thought I'd throw this into the discussion (a logic bomb?), based upon my research I've ascertained that the majority of abortions don't even fall into the argument from sapience.   http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                       facts/after_12_weeks.html    Name your source, they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve (88% to 89% according to each).   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png    This handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10-12.  According to wikipedia, the nervous system begins development around week ten.  So, from all this information, I would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness (no brain) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they can't be aware. In this case I think the remaining 11% to 12% of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed.  I applaud you for a well-reasoned argument, but I had some ideas which weren't considered:   #1   Suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother.  Suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person (as you explained cogently, the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary, at least in a legal sense).  In this case, one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother, who has greater capacity for individuality, thought, and so-forth, right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and isn't yet granted the ""benefit of the doubt"" which the title of personhood confers.   #2   Suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of ""dead"" where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience.  In this case, all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart doesn't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen. It's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood.   #3   Suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus doesn't become a ""baby"" until say, week X (where X is some high week, like between 30 and 36).  In this case, the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion.   #4   This is basically an extended version of #1, but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience, and with high priority.  Suppose we consider the mother's rights as a person to be of paramount importance. These include a right over her body.  In this case, it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system, even if it means that around 1% of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses. We consider their sapience to be less than the woman's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live.  I'd like to address some of what you said:    AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.  BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?   I believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease, is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception. In other words, under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers, that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest, and that test reveals something to be lost. Similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met, and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example, not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer (which technically might disqualify you, but police don't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone).",1

"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.  First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.  But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.",1
"I like how you've become more radical with your ideas :)   Most great ideas are radical, but there's a downside: You have to be prepared to defend it from those who don't like radical ideas. You'll also need to refine this idea to make it workable and more convincing.    Something like this might work better : Keep abortions legal and well regulated but make it expensive, effectively imposing a monetary fine on unwanted pregnancies, a jail term may be considered to further deter unwanted pregnancies. Over time, this program will be just like the introduction of seatbelts in cars, people will no longer need to be reminded to avoid unwanted pregnancies, effectively eliminating abortions.",1
"No the question is what do you not understand. You are the one saying that an undeveloped human hasn't the rights of a developed human an yet we were all once ""undeveloped"" so we technically have no rights since we were undeveloped. So you would not care if your parents decided that oh we want an abortion because it is undeveloped so it does not have the rights that we developed humans do.",0
The offspring of the corrupted will also be corrupted. The flood for example every one was corrupt except Noah and his family. Sodom and Gomorrah God gave Abraham to find righteous people the number lowered until finally God said find 10 righteous people Abraham could not and so was the destruction of the cities. Before the cities were destroyed God sent and Angel to worn the righteous people which was only lot and his family which still were not to righteous but they were righteous enough that they listened to the Angel and left. These are only a 2 examples.,0
"Abortion is going to happen. Its been going on forever. People that are against it do so for moral reasons. I completely understand, but you are failing to realize that it will happen regardless of the legality of the procedure and in some cases is completely warranted. For example, what if your 14 year old daughter is raped and becomes pregnant. Does that not constitute a valid reason for the termination of a pregnancy. What if you are going to give birth to a child with a severe birth defect or extreme retardation. If it wasn't for new advances in medicine these people would never survive anyway, so how is it any different? It sounds harsh and heartless but it is reality none the less. Its like people that are against stem cell research because some of the stem cells come from aborted fetuses. Ok, you object on moral grounds, I get it but what if you're paralyzed and the researchers say a dead baby will help you walk again are you really going to tell me that you're not going to give the green light. The child was aborted regardless of what decision you made, at least let the horrible process have some good that comes out of it.",1
"It is not accurate. They don't use, the only word I can think to describe them, tongs. They use a vacuum now.   And I actually don't have a problem with any abortions. I just don't like that they use something that's illegal, and it is almost everywhere, though like everything illegal it's doesn't mean it doesn't happen, to convince people to change their minds.   I don't honestly care if it's alive or not, it's a burden, usually a complete accident and we're over-populated as it is. So abortion is a good choice in my opinion.",1
"If it can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember; can't survive without complete and total dependence on the biology of another being; and doesn't look particularly like people -- what exactly is it that makes this a ""human""?",1
If its so disgusting then why do you want it legal so people can do it? You stand in the same line as they do if you want it legal. There is no moral difference. You simply do not want protection for the unborn. How is this pro-life?  You state abortion is disgusting and that its gross irreverence for life…  You can't' be both. You can't want abortion legal and then claim your pro-life .  Your position is morally baffling.,1

"Another moral relativist......sigh....  If there is nothing wrong with abortion then how can you say abortion is wrong after 24 weeks? My neice was born at 23 weeks and last year graduated from college. Although it was a long road...she is normal, in fact she is brilliant and graduated with over a 4.4 grade point. To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy. They say the happiest people live in poorer countries. You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society. Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?  It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, it is a fact that the eggs in a female is human.....when the sperm of a male homosapien meets the egg of a female homosapien.........starts another separate HUMAN BEING, who has its own organs, finderprints and DNA. Louise Brown the first test tube baby was NOT APART OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE WAS CONCEIVED. She began her life in a petri dish. She was a human being from conception. Could she sing the Star Spangled Banner, do times tables, drive a car? No But can a baby who is just born do any of those tasks? No   HUMAN EMBRYOLOGY, by Dr. Bradley M. Patten.  He states, ""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermaozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""   Dr. Keith Moore's text on embryology, referring to the single-cell zygote says, ""The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being. He also states, ""Each of us stated life as a cell called a zygote.""  Dr. Keith Moore, the Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 2d ed. (Philadelphia, Penn)  J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics (New York : McGraw Hill) In their work on biology and obstetrics, state, “The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.”  Dr. Louis Fridhandler, in the medical textbook “Gametogenesis to Implantation Biology of Gestation,” vol.1, ed. N.S. Assau (New York: Academic Press) refers to fertilization as “that wondrous moment that marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.”    Doctors, E.L. Potter and J.M Craig write in Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers) “Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.”  These doctors tesified before a United States Senate Committee on life.   Dr. Alfred Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.  He said, “I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life….I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of puberty….is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.”  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He says” after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.”  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: “By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.”  I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?   Could you just answer this one question for me. What is the goal of every abortionist?",0

"With so many excruciatingly painful situations throughout the world that need our immediate attentions, abortion is so far down the list as not to be anything for me to consider. One exception: I would favor legislating against abortion after the 4th or 5th month of pregnancy. However, even in such cases, under certain circumstances and in timely fashion, such a law would be made circumventable.  I would suggest that we spend more time, effort, and resources looking after those humans we already have on board.

"1. In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one  to  abort, what gives another a right to force another  not  to abort? If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it, he's like all powerful or something right? He doesn't need your help asshole.  4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening.  5. Making abortions illegal  has  been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths.

"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion.   Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legal…on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.   But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission.   Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.    It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.   Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things! If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.",1
I think so it prevents a child from having a life. Life is a blessing and who are we too take it away from someone???,0

"Not true. There are more unwanted children than families willing to adopt (123,000 more as of 2008). If abortion were illegal, that number would balloon.   http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/ stats_research/afcars/trends.htm",1
"Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as ""its my body its my choice"" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.  You cannot say that a fetus is not human, or not living. Everything about the fetus was made from living organism, and blood and cells ect ect, it took two LIVING breathing humans to make this child. Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.   There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves. If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.  If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.  Every child deserves a voice, every child deserves to live. Women simply need to wake up and take action for their mistakes. Abortion is murder.",0

You're so wrapped up in this duality you've created you haven't even considered that my position is not one of morality. I'm not ""for"" or ""against"" abortion.   It's called ""pro CHOICE"" not ""pro abortion"". =/   You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right.   No, you've IMPOSED this position on me. This is a matter of your prejudice, not my implication.   Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact?   I don't care because it doesn't matter. I have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people. Perhaps some people end up more responsible, perhaps some don't.   The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.   To justify and prove, eh? A debate is a means, the purpose is invented by the individual. This is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own.   Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone.   You seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion. A position without opinion is just facts, a position without facts is just opinion. You need both.  I'm not arguing against the facts, I'm arguing against your stupidity. Don't try to shift the blame onto the facts, they can't help what they are.   Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case.   Because your argument is rooting in morality, mine is rooting in questioning your morality. If you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference, you're still arguing from your personal preferences.   And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself.   Then start a debate ""How did Abortion Originate?"". It's another topic and doesn't bare any relevance to this one.    Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you?   You wouldn't like my answer =p   Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.   Can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar? You can pull up ""facts"" until your fingers are worn to stubs. It means nothing if they aren't relevant.    If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?   You... totally missed the point -_-   Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion.   Are you dyslexic? That made almost no sense. =/  Again, look up the term ""debunking"".   But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them?   Again, I've said no such thing. At least  try  to make relevant arguments. =/   I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.   Well well, what a noble man you are; placing the value of life above the value of a good life...  Did I say noble? I meant retarded.   Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?   Again, either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots. ;)   Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.   Debating 101: debunking and calling out opponents on non-sequiters IS how a debate works.   There's no need to ""prove"" someone else's abortion is none of my (or your) business. Debunking your reasons for being ""pro-life"" does that by itself. Do you understand?   You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.   1+2=3 &lt;&lt; you understand this, right? Well, here's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend.   District attorneys are people. People can be stupid and childish; therefore, district attorneys can be stupid and childish.  There's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they aren't infallible.    Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.   Everything is constantly changing. You're heart pumps fresh blood, your skin falls off and is replaced, sperms turn into zygotes etc. etc. etc.  Life and death aren't opposites, they're complementariness.   Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.   Wrong again. I'm not building an argument, I'm debunking yours. There's no ""running"" here, simply wading through the things you've said.   And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?   Nothing you just wrote changes that your Hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate. you could be lying about the whole thing for all I know.  Come on use your head and not only your eyes.

"[In my point of view, abortion shouldn't be banned. Abortion is a not bad thing for women, especially for teenagers. Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong, but most of those people even haven't been pregnant. It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion, but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice.   When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Abortion is not very good, of course. But it is not wrong. It is a choice. It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant. You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do? Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong? I don't think so. You would think, even for a minute you would think about abortion.  What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Abortion is a murder. I agree with that. But everybody has a right to be wrong. Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it. We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion. As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.  How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   So, I can say that all of us make mistakes, we are not perfect. Nobody does. But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes.   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.  But if woman decided not to have a child, it is not wrong.  It is not good, but not wrong.]",1
"Why make it illegal for women to choose what goes in in her own body? It's not illegal for women to choose sexual partners or what vitamins they take in the morning or what they eat for lunch, why try to limit their opportunity to choose whether or not THEY want a child?  Law Enforcement is great, but it doesn't have a standing on this issue. Illegal abortions aren't obvious or even really noticeable crimes, yet they cost so many lives that could be saved by simply legalizing abortions.   If you don't believe in Abortion... don't get one. that's your free choice... Why is this even being discussed in society, really?   Whatever happened to freedom of property, expression and religion?",0
"I've lost everybody in this thread... can we just say that:  - stabbing a dog anywhere is kinda sick and is not ok (unless you eat dogs like in some countries).   - abortion should not be outlawed until week 20 into the pregnancy.  - people who are pro-life should keep their point of view and not force it on others and make them feel like they're murders, cos it's not like killing a person.",1
So elaborate on that.  Is abortion ok if the child is the wrong sex?  Something wrong with it?  Timing is wrong?  Dont know who father is?  Might be born into poverty?  Mother has to many other kids?  Mother cant afford it?  Mother wants to sell fetal body parts?  Rape?   Incest?  Woman might have stretch marks?  Which one is a good medical reason for abortion? Less than 1% of ALL ABORTIONS ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO ARE DYING. In most cases the baby can be saved.  Odd...you know its taking the life of a little human being...it gives you the shivers...you dont want to think about it......BUT YOU SAY ITS NOT MORALLY WRONG. LMAO  If its not wrong and the most widely performed surgical procedure in the country...world....then why do you shiver?   Did I miss something?,0
"If you kill a child, I'd kill you myself if I could. But we're not talking about children or babies here are we? so don't try to change the definition of a fetus to suit your arguments because that definition is simply wrong.  Don't try and force me to have children when I don't want to. They're fetuses. I make them and I can break them and make some more, it's a difficult decision when I have to abort them, but when I'm ready to have children I will have children, not when you think I'm ready. It makes no difference to your life, but it has a massive impact on mine so don't butt in! Women who've had abortions have gone on to have children later on when they're ready.  You claim to represent mothers who've chosen to keep their babies - good for you, but here's a news flash: they don't actually need you to represent them! They don't need you to argue that they should be allowed to keep their babies, nobody's trying to stop them! So it's a great position of risk that you've placed yourself in. A very challenging role! I don't know how you do it!",1
"If a 12 year old girl is raped and gets pregnant, do you really want that girl who isn't even a teenager yet to give birth? It is completely the girls choice. You can't tell a girl whether she should   have a child or not. You might say that there is always another adult who could adopt the child, but what about the act of giving birth? The biological mother could die during the process. If abortion isn't legal, then we need free birth control. But it would be best with both because then the biological mother gets a choice.",1
"Exactly.  You wouldn't have cared, because you couldn't have cared.  You would have never have had the chance to voice your opinion; to have your say as you do today.",0
There are plenty of people out there who have fertility problems and would love for the opportunity to adopt a child. Why not have the child and give it up for adoption?,0
"Then you are psychotic.   (Laughs)   The United States.   I care not about the laws of the United States, I am not american (thankfully) thus subjective parochial american laws mean nothing to me and have no bearing on the comparative ethics of abortion.   Apples are multicellular. They are communities of plant cells. They are living organisms.   Such ignorance...do apples breed?  Do they feed?  Do they excrete?  Do they react to stimuli?  Get a science education before you post.   I have as much emotion for a foetus dying as an apple or plum being consumed. They are on the same level of self-awareness (or lack thereof).   You are psychotic...and I feel the same way about anyone who harms the defenceless... ;)",0
"I'd also like to add..................  If as you declare your question to be specific to medical conditions, may I NSH suggest that you leave the matter to the physicians and the mother. I find it downright presumptuous of you and others to get involved. Surely your life consists of matters over which you legitimately do have control. This is NOT one of them.",1
Putting up your unwanted child for adoption as a choice but should not be made compulsory. I actually think it's better for Americans to adopt those unfortunate children from the third world. It will give them a better chance at life in a better society.,1
how could abortion be acceptable think about the nature of it itself not yet born and a child is kill rather crucial when you think about it.but i must ask those who say yes to this argument lets put it this ways you are in the comfort of your moms womb and then you were killed you hadn't not born never seen or taste or touch and for every day of your life you wonder to your self why did my mom abort me and to think again maybe i would have been a great politician or even the future Martin Luther King but then again you would never know cause you were never born,0
"Many of you view abortion of taking a minature breathing baby out of the mom and breaking its neck or something, it is not like that. Many times an abortion occurs the fetus is just a clump of developing cells and, in fact, it is not a living thing at all.   Some say (when this defense is brought up), ""It is killing a future baby"". Well, actually, whenever a woman has her period she is killing a future baby.    Sorry if this defense crushes all the beliefs you were taught..",1
"BS foetuses have brains and central nervous systems...they can feel pain and even hear sounds outside of the womb...do you know anything?   A brain is not a mind. They are separate. A mind is a brain with identity.  They respond to sounds and stimuli, they are not really aware. How could they be aware as we think of it when an infant is only starting to develop this aspect of mind?",1
"Yes, but  why ? In your post on my ""Why is killing wrong?"" debate, you said killing is wrong because it damages the group and because it causes pain. Neither of those apply when killing non-intelligent life.  As for where we draw the line, for the purposes of this debate, let's draw it at any non-zero intelligence. That is, if there's any intellectual capacity at all, killing the person is wrong. So killing a week-old clump of cells is ok, killing somebody who is completely brain-dead is ok, killing anybody else is not ok.",1
Many abortion doctors admit that this baby is a living human being. Many baptize the babies after the abortion is finished.,0
"They don't use, the only word I can think to describe them, tongs. They use a vacuum now.   A vacuum? oh that's alright then. Much less barbaric ;)   it's a burden   If having a child would be burden, then having sex is a terrible idea. Just sayin'. There is no way to be 100% sure that sex will not result in impregnation, so (assuming conceptuality), both parties should be prepared for all possible outcomes. Don't ya think?    usually a complete accident   Haha. It would take massive amounts of illicit drug use to be an accident ;) (I don't know that from personal experience so don't you be gettin' any ideas). Sex is intentional. In nature, it is meant to result in fertilization. It is not an ""accident,"" it is what is supposed to happen.",0
"Safe, legal, and rare. Prevent rape by sex-ed, use only highly-trained doctors, and include it in insurance. If an abortion is necessary (mental, physical, or deciding not to have a kid), then do it. Abortion pretty much only works after 3 weeks, and before that, contraception.",1
"Abortion should be illegal by mind, spirit and law. First off, if you would want to KILL INNOCENT BABIES CREATED BY YOUR FOOLISHNESS, WHY ON EARTH DID YOU GET PREGNANT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

"I've seen these videos. If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what it  looks  like.  You're talking about  you're  feelings and what  you  believe because you're a typical self-righteous self-involved christian completely incapable of understanding that what  you  think and feel is not what everyone else thinks and feels.  The laws put in place on abortion take into account what  science  finds to be true  not how you  feel  helliom or what you think some invisible daddy in the sky wants you to feel.  Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances. Before then it's not a human yet, it's the specific woman's body and not yours, and it's none of your business.  That's how it is and that's how it should be,  no matter how many of you right wing nuts highjack this site and serial downvote us sane and logical participants on the site.",1

"Reality check required? Is your statement an argument or a personal attack?  Clearly you are indeed a fool if you believe that I am suggesting an imediate termination and outlaw on abortion. I, as many do, believe that we can work towards the issue, rather than circling it as people like you do.  Who do you defend with your outrageous suggestions? The mother? From what exactly?  The point of it all is to prevent an unwanted prenancy, we can agree on that.  You suggest terminating part of the problem, I suggest that we create a solution to the entire situation.  And, yeah, that reality check I mentioned, it may very well be overdue.",0
"The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.   That is an example of what is called jumping to conclusions. You have not established that it abortion is never justified. Even if it is agreed (which I do agree with you) that it is a human life.",1
"It is the woman's body, therefore it should be her choice. You can't just take away her right to choose because  you  think it is wrong. And, if it was made illegal, what would she do with the baby afterwards? Put it in an orphanage? There are already so many children without a home and people to care for them. Why add more? Also, the child could be neglected or abused by the mother.  That  would really pain the child. Now, as to the idea the child could grow to become someone important to the world, can't it be the other way around as well? The child could also become an absolute lunatic in the future, who's to tell?",1

"""This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.""   A mammalian cell, if processed to revert it back to totipotency, will grow into a zygote, and then a full human. This is like asexual reproduction. Your line of reasoning is flawed.  Now you just defined the concept of human life to include an unthinking mass of tissue cells. That cheapens what it means to be human.   ""This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.""   Consequences of a truth do not make the truth any less correct. Humans are defined by their ability to think, reason, and learn; they are defined by a culture spanning tens of thousands of years. Homo sapiens sapiens is defined by genetic relationship. Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).   ""What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.""   You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.   ""You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.""   Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.   ""The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference. ""   You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life.   ""Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.""   I ignore it because it has no rights. It isn't human. If you can't understand why a mass of cells smaller than a skin flake without a brain isn't human, then I suggest you stop arguing and read some college-level biology textbooks. You need a biology education.  But we're hovering around why you believe it is human, actually. This is probably a religious matter for you, not grounded in evidence, or logic.   ""And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.""   It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born. Stop using language that is categorically wrong in order to try and tie together a poor argument.   ""When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).""   I could argue that my religion treats as matter of faith that sperm has souls in all the cells, and that spilling sperm wastefully is murdering all those souls. I could them take up a moral platform with my church and crusade across the country trying to get masturbation banned along with pornography, and sex education.  The point to take from this is that these issues are rooted in dogma that cannot be argued away. Science already provides some clear-cut information that could be used to answer the question of whether a fetus or zygote is alive or should be properly construed as human in a legal context. Dogmatic people insist upon having beliefs however, with no evidence to support themselves beyond the emotional and intuitive appeal of their arguments.  You are the one here that is making a claim that is just assumed to be true, with no room for negotiation. You insist upon having beliefs instead of knowledge, and that is why I ridicule you.",1
"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1
"""If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives?""  They don't. Not if they do it for the right reasons. There is always the ""what if"" factor. But millions of women have had abortions and are living perfectly healthy, happy, successful lives. About half of women in the US who have had an abortion already have children, so they know the joys and stresses of children. They make the decision for the greater good--the family and society.",1

Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of ""X"" and put your reason in place of ""Y"" and you've got your argument.  Can you see the analogy between them now? So my principal objection is with the ""Y"" when you have an embryo for ""X""",0

I said that?  ""Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?"" Were did i do that? I thought the question was; Should abortion be banned.   And help me with this one: ""We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.""  Who is judging someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?  Please show me were I said that.  Just for the record; my view is that everyone of us, apart from the grace of Jesus Christ, is hell bound for the high crime of cosmic treason, aka idolatry. Romans 1:18-25  Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here. That's an objective standard, not a subjective one as you suggest. And he says in the last passage that all men will be judged by this law. That means it applies to all men, at all times and in all places. that is the polar opposite of what you say.  So one of you has got to be wrong.  Matthew 19:17-19   17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”  18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”  Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”  Matthew 5:20   For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.",1

"First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion.   If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.",1
"Life is defined scientifically as any organism containing most or all of the following qualities:  1. Homeostasis - regulation of internal environment  2. Organization - composed of one or more structured cells  3. Metabolism - able to transform food into energy and use it  4. Growth - increasing in size or complexity  5. Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.  The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother.  Therefore, given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development. As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being.  If this is true no other arguments matter. Size, stage of growth (children are less developed than adults, are they less than human?), and location do not matter at all. If it is an individual human being, it has all the rights and protections of all other human beings. Killing this life is tantamount to murder.",0
"I believe that if a parent can take care if a child then they shouldn't be able to get an abortion, but sometimes a child being born causes great strain on the parents and could possibly lead to death. Therefore, I believe that it should be the person's choice.",1

"Some evidence please?  Otherwise LOL   It is an obvious extrapolation from known facts.  Taxis does not require a mind, as observed in simple animals like fruit flies. Brains themselves are complicated entities, which in Humans mature at around 18 to 23 years. Infant brains are still critically forming, hence why they are so dependent upon us and only start learning language after at least the first year and motor function is under critical development.  Why would you assume that an infant has a fully aware mind at birth, much less the weeks before birth all the way down to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy?",1
"//Personally, I don't think abortion should be allowed anywhere. //  Right, that's why you should try and find a way to prevent this from happening naturally, since up to 70% of fertilised eggs are naturally aborted from the body. Good luck with that.  //The mother always has choices readily available to them//  There are only to choices when faced with an unintended pregnancy - to remain or not remain pregnant. Adoption is an acceptable solution for an unwanted child, but does nothing for the woman who does not want to remain pregnant.  //I think that for those who consider an abortion, they shouldn't have opened their legs in the first place, whether the guy was wearing a glove or not. //  Ah, so it's the dirty woman's fault for having sex even though she used contraceptives to prevent it? Give it up, this argument is all fail when: 1) Sex directly results in depositing sperm into the vagina, NOT instant pregnancy or ""baby""; 2) Fertilisation can occur outside of the body without any sexual activity.  //Unless there was a life-or-death situation where the mother could die with a c-section or die having a baby. then it's appropriate.//  Ah, so you are pro-choice after all, yes?",1
"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you. Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion. If i recalled my opposing team was pro choice. Why? Because they are against abortion. You seem to be lacking common sense. Really? As far as i am concerned whatever a person say portrays the idea of that person as in reading a book and trying to figure out the idea or goal of the writer. Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge. Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence. Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science. You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts. Please, you are a person of science one day you will stand against an opposing team face to face and then you will understand what i am talking about. When you say that i am retarded lets say that a woman who intentionally has unprotected sex aware of the consequences but now goes to the extent of killing the fetus, are you implying that there is no innocence or good in that fetus? Are you saying that there is nothing wrong with that? To me that is just selfishness. Well in order to debate a topic you need to know the origin of that case and then identify the weakness in that origin. If it was a speech called informative speech and lets say you were referring to reasons why abortion should be made illegal then the origin would have been completely different as my professor advised me last week. Well Actually you do not need to say who is worst or not because i have friends in pre law on here and have already taken a look at this debates and has already given me a response.  Why are you running from the truth? Point out to one statement which you made that had an authoritative reference? Exactly. When you think you know everything or do not want to know then your perception might be wrong. Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy. Believe me and my team comprises of at least 25 members who are excellent at debating. I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.  You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance. You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey. Maybe you are better off in science. When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.  And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.  There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute. Check up on your book again my friend. And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.",0

Obviously if you are thinking of abortion as killing a little kid you are going to be against it.  But lets say there are women who consider that thing growing in them for the first 3 months nothing more than a cluster of cells? I mean, there is no evidence otherwise. You may  believe  there is some magic daddy in the sky giving this thing a soul, but she disagrees with you on that and you have no proof otherwise.  She is not  forcing  you to have abortions.

For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it. In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people). But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.   1 is not 4 is a proposition. The proposition is not an accounting statement. It is a proposition that asserts that 1 and 4 are not predicable of each other. In fact if that proposition is debatable then the law of mathematics is without a foundation.

That does not mean that there are ten ways it happened. There is only one way it happened and one truth.   The truth is the truth even if we can't see it.   What is radical about saying that abortion is wrong? It once was murder in America it was not radical back then. Does morality change? Is pedophelia wrong? Is there gray area in that?  What Hitler did...was that right or wrong...where is the gray area concerning the ovens?   Were the 9-11 radicals right in taking down and killing all those on 9-11?   You said something completely contradictory here....""To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.""  You say its wrong....but its right. If you say the woman has the right to kill because it is her body...then you cant deny her this right throughout the entire pregnancy. Which means that you are killing way beyond the time of viability. Is the fetus less human at three months...than at nine? If you are pro-choice...then the answer to this would not make a difference.   Humans judge humanity all the time....our police, teachers, clergy, court systems, parents. We all judge. You are judging me by the statements I make.   I do not need you to tell me what is right and wrong, or anyone for that matter. I do not believe that it takes a village to raise a child. I believe we are responsible for what we say and do, that we are capable to decide for ourselves.   What is a human being?    http://www.thefreedictionary.com/human   It is a fact that the human being in the womb is alive before the abortion...is dead after the abortion. The human is killed. It is not an animal....a rock......it is human and has all the characteristics of a human being...even at the embryonic stage. A human is a human...whether alive or dead. This Cassie Anthony murder trial....Kaylee was found in skeletal form, nevertheless they were human remains. That which is in the womb...whether at one month, or nine....is human.  You said, ""If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.""  Humanity is not measured by consciousness. If so...the mentally retarded, those in comas, vegetative stages do not deserve it and can be treated like you say.... like masses of soulless meat. A hearless and barbaric statement to make.....  How do you know when a sould inhabits the body? In Christian scriptures....God controls this ...""before I formed you I knew you."" For you to say when a body has a soul.....is impossible. Are you god?  And if you are a humanist....why are you even mentioning souls....?  ""It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.""  Mass of meat? Are you a butcher or something? LOL   To say that those who are unconscious are not human have no soul.....that is insane and not scientific at all.   Just curious what you think about these...  Abortion to purify the races. (Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood, hated blacks and targeted them through abortion. Hitler admired her.)  Abortion for profit. Women selling their fetal body parts for cash.  Abortion because something is wrong with fetus...wrong sex, hair lip...etc  Abortion to control the population.   Like I said you are all over on this. Abortion is right, no its wrong when.....and when that time is you cant pinpoint. No one could do this while the human is growing in the womb.   Do you know when they can detect measureable brain waves in the womb? Why should this matter to you?       http://www.buzzle.com/articles/ brain-development-in-fetus.html     So all of a sudden at some time (you cant pinpoint) abortion is wrong.

You can look at countries where abortion is illegal to figure out why it should be legal.,1
"Yeah sure, I'm pro-choice... pro-choice in the sense that the choice is made when the soon-to-be mother chose to act irresponsibly and have unprotected sex.   So many liberals out there try to paint this idealistic picture that you can make stupid decisions without any real consequences, but that's simply not true. When you have unprotected sex, a baby is conceived. At that moment, whether the baby has a pumping heart or not, it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby. That could mean one of many options, such as raising the baby yourself, putting it up for adoption, or any number of alternatives. But I will tell you, as basic human decency should tell you, that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable.   You chose to act irresponsibly. Now you must face the consequences, and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being.  Now, of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions. In these cases, I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have. She did nothing wrong, and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist. But at the same time, I still believe that life begins at conceptions, and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make. Do you believe in giving life to another human being, filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself, or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman? At that point, the government should have nothing to do at all with the mother's say; she is no longer the irresponsible one, but rather the victim of a gruesome and despicable crime.",0
"You do not have to be more easy going on the restrictions you chose to place on your own life, but you must realize that people place different values on different things depending on what is important to them.

However, I realize you place more value on faith than logic, and I do not think that logic is inherently better than faith so I would never try to force you to accept logic over faith. I think you should afford people the same courtesy, realize God and the Bible are not important to everyone, and not try to extend your judgments and morals to include them.",1
"""Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?""  Because it's part of the woman until birth.

You say you read into both sides but I don't believe that as I see no reference to the societal benefits of abortion in your response.",1
Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing. It's an entirely different debate.  A fetus that's not capable of survival without being directly attached to its mother via the umbilical cord is still not yet a person that merits society's involvement. It is the mother's property until this point and she must have the choice of keeping it or not. You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself. If you can keep the baby alive with milk then by all means take it out and do that if you want. The mother doesn't have to be involved any more.,1
"Ok.  You're now officially making ludicrous points. Congrats.  Gargantuous isn't even close to the word which is used to describe the difference between a sperm cell and an unborn fetus: A sperm cell has not yet entered the fertilisation process; a fetus has.  You said it yourself: There are thousands of sperm. There are also many eggs in a female. If you masterbate, it isn't the end of the sperm world! There are still going to be thousands upon thousands more and ready to be concieved! So please do not BS this debate and say that sperm = fetus, because it is completely wrong.  Lose a sperm cell, no big deal; lose a fetus, there is something to be concerned with.  No need to over-explain, your whole argument was wrong anyway.",0

"If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault!   What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex. They KNEW no protection or form of contraception is 10% effective. If it fails, don't blame the contraceptive. They knew there was a chance that it could fail. Yet, knowing this AND knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work, they still had sex. They put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing.    That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   That is an awful analogy. A better analogy would be if the Haitians had placed thousands of tons of high explosives on the fault line and blew them up and were surprised there was an earthquake.   I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition. Yes, there are scientific definitions, but that is irrelevant because you chose to ignore them in favor of an inappropriate one.    Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged?   Nope. That is a lie. I said serious defect. By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death. It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop. That is not a defect, that is immaturity.",0
I think you have missed my basic point.  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana...so your comparisons are utterly absurd.   Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds).,1
Of all the arguments I have made about this issue I think it comes down to this simple fact; Abortion should be banned because the most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.  I say this because statistically speaking more human beings are killed there everyday than anywhere else. That in my opinion simply should not be.,0
"I think the crux isn't really whether it's DNA, but rather potential. Because again, we dint know where to draw the line between what's considered human and what isn't in terms of DNA. But alas, i support the right to abortion because i believe it really should be the mother's choice. Consider if I suddenly imposed a set of conditions on your lifestyle out of the blue. Would you want to be rid of me? As natural as to value the sacridity of human life, I believe the right to self determination is equally important. But realistically, it occurs to me again and again that human life isn't valued, while self determination is aggressively fought for, and that is why I think it makes more sense to support self determination rather than human life.",0
Putting more children up for adoption when there are already hundreds of thousands of children waiting to be adopted is ridiculous if you really think about it. Most of these children are put into foster care where they spend part of their lives with 6 or 7 other kids being miserable because they are being moved around 15 or 16 times in a year. We have all heard about how traumatizing foster care can be for a lot of children who end up having a lot of mental issues and distress when they are older. Yeah you may be keeping a child a live but when you think about what they have to go through as children in the system is it really worth it? And not to mention if they do get adopted young and find out when they are older it is going to be extremely hard for them. When people get abortions the baby cant process it or know!! What is the baby going to miss or know if they are never born nothing. Its not like they are going to be born to another family and say oh yeah i had a mother once but she got rid of me before i was born.,1
"There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.   In some cases an abortion may be life saving to the pregnant woman. I don't think that a woman who chooses abortion to save her own life is committing an immoral act.   Taking the life of another person is an injustice   In general I agree that is true, but you yourself admit that sometimes it is justifiable to take a life DO YOU NOT?   If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?   I never said that ""government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights"". Whatever just authority it does have is derived from the consent of the governed.  How far do we let government go ""protecting"" us. There are a million more laws I'm sure that can be shoved down our throats in the name of protection. Our right to privacy applies at some point, and I think health care decisions made in a doctor's office merit that privacy from government intrusion.",1
"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1
"Actually, depending on what is allowed in ""abstinence"", it may not. Oral sex, for instance, can transmit STD's, and many abstinent teens turn to oral sex as a way to satisfy their sexual desires.   I'm arguing that sexual desires are natural. It's easy to succumb to those desires and so abstinence-only education is weak. It ignores the fact that some people will CHOOSE not to remain abstinent. And that these people deserve facts on having safe sex. And furthermore, that if we made contraception more widely available to those who choose not to be abstinent, we can drastically cut down on the numbers of abortions.",1

However, ideas have consequences and some ideas are deadly. So I would say that some ideas are vastly superior to others. What Mother Teresa did was a superior idea than what jihadist are doing. But jihadist are human and therefore are valuable human beings worthy of dignity and respect. So as humans I respect them but it's their ideas that I don't respect.

So as a human I will treat you with dignity and respect but I can't say I will do that with all your ideas, only the ones that are good by objective standards.",1

Not necessarily. This depends on the maturity level of the youths! Sex ed is thus of great importance.,1
"You seem to have missed my point. Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.  Concerning the issue of abortion - by what right and under what authority does anyone claim the power to deny the fundamental right of an individual to choose for herself? Regardless of the circumstance or whether you agree with her choice.  By the way, kudos for speaking your mind when creating this debate rather than opting for the hackneyed ""cutting and pasting."" That would be somewhat trite, don't you think?",1

"You don't nor should you. The government should remain neutral on this issue. It's the parent's responsibility, not the state's. We need to get sex ed out of public schools and give the choice of sex ed back to the parents were it belongs. And may the best idea win.",1
"I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.  First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions. This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience. But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it. The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.  The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is. It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable. So my effort is to make that know as best I can. But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed. So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible. There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His. When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled. Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account. So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness. And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.  This is only possible through repentance and faith. Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ. This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers. It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.  With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question  should abortion be banned . But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer. I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion. There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed. There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles. So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.   The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.    Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification. therefore it is murder and should be illegal",0
"Religion can't be your argument, since it hinges on what people believe and some believe in choice.  When you say ""women"", you generalize and include all females, but some women, again, prefer a choice.  I've said it plenty of times and I'll say it again, a fetus before it can survive outside of the mother's womb is a POTENTIAL life, which is the same as an independent egg or sperm and anything else in between.",1
"Frankly, anyone has the right to abortion because of free will and liberty, and nobody has the right to tell anyone what to do with their body.  HOWEVER,  The only problem I have is the definition of fetus and human.  If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human",0
Have you ever considered the people who think abortion is okay have been born? Just a thought.,0
the unborn baby didn't make the choice to be killed. How can killing someone who can't consent be considered an acceptable choice?,0
"If it is not considered life when the egg is fertilized and is starting to grow, the when does it become a life. Where is the line between a incomplete mass of cells and a life.   The best line I can determine is when an offspring becomes self-aware, it is considered a life worth protecting. Since it may be that even an infant isn't fully self-aware, we could set the line to when the fetus has a sufficiently developed brain. These are all measurable to some extent. These are also both good arguments for when a fetus should be protected because they can be defended rationally.   If a woman miscarries is she wrong to fell like she lost her child.   No. It is a reasonable reaction upon losing a potential life.   Oh, and since when does self-awareness determine life, a man in a coma is still human.   A man in an early coma may regain consciousness. A man who is in a permanent coma is just an empty shell, the only rational argument that could be made for keeping that shell alive is if the brain damage could be repaired feasibly in the future. Otherwise, it is only sentimentality that is making people keep the shell alive.   Edit:   By the way, I'm matter-of-fact about these things because I have no emotional attachment to the subject. I am not trying to treat this subject flippantly, if it seems that way.",1
"You said the fetus is not human then what is it? Again read up on Webster v. Rp  For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?  The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?",1

"Being alive is the most valuable and precious thing on earth, and I don't see why people take death lightly. Anyone could walk out of their house one day and get killed by a bus, or any vehicle. Life is too short. If a person decides to have sex unprotected, they should be able to make this choice with the consequences in mind. Everybody who has sex is old enough to know the consequences and with sex education being compulsory on the national curriculum there really is no excuse. The NHS will give out free contraception so there is no way that you can say it isn't available in this country. If you value life, then you would never have an abortion, abortions in my opinion are given out too freely and are an easy way out for someone who was so stupid enough not to take contraception. During childbirth, so many drugs and forms of giving births are available so there is no excuse why (except medical conditions) that a woman wouldn't be able to give birth.",0
"First of all, don't argue about something you can't even spell correctly. Second, abortion is completely wrong whether or not it is economically beneficial to an adoption market.

Most abortions occur in high school teenagers, so an overworked mother is out of the question for the most part. I am so adamant about this because my mother had two abortions before my birth.

If  one is ridiculous enough to argue potential life, I would point out that every time I or any male cums there are approximately 2000 ""potential lives"" - and by the logic of potential life, we should all bottle our sperm and save our eggs and inject every last one so there are a trillion trillion bastards running around by 2020.

Throughout history countless children were unplanned that turned out great...and remember there is adoption. Spoiled disrespectful children, who WERE wanted may be a bigger problem now.

If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator, there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby. A child changes the lives of many people involved. If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all. We're there medically.

"Ok, first let's get some terminology straight. Until the end of the eighth week after fertilization we have what's called an  embryo . An embryo is basically just a clump of cells with the potential to grow into a person. I think it's wrong to give it the same status as a fully developed human. I think abortion of an embryo should be legal, although, once it develops into a fetus it become more objectionable.   ""You could get the procedure before even giving the idea much thought. It shouldn't be an option. It should be illegal.""   You would have plenty of time to think about it. It's not like a woman can just touch her stomach and kill the baby. She would have to go the clinic, consult a physician, make an appointment, and then show up to the procedure. She could change her mind at any time.  And if this isn't enough time, it  still  isn't necessary to make abortion illegal -- we could simply enforce a waiting period of a week or so.

The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident.   Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring. And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves.

Good luck!",0
"I do not see it as acceptable except in extreme health cases. The reason for this is that a fetus is a human life form, and abortion is either murder or stopping a human life from becoming fully developed into a person. I'm not saying it's not a difficult issue, or that other viewpoints are invalid, of course. It's just the way I see it, and it makes sense to me logically. Is even the case of rape a reason to kill a human life? Perhaps, if it is before the fetus gains a consciousness. But if you are killing a conscious human being, I can't see even the case of rape justifying that.   Now, I do not know at what point during pregnancy, or after, a child/fetus has consciousness. If anyone knows this(and can back it up with a reliable source), by all means, tell me. I'm not saying that the knowledge(even if it says the fetus does not have consciousness) would definitely change my viewpoint, but it could.  At any rate, I don't think that abortion without good reason would be okay, because whether or not a fetus is a person, it is a developing human life.   So...go on. Tear me apart. But be nice, 'cause tomorrow's my birthday. x)",0
"Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?    I never said it's sole purpose was procreation. The core question is one of anthropology; does man have a nature and is that nature fixed? You would apparently say no and that man gets to define that nature. Laws should be based on ethics, not morality. However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality. Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from. Everything becomes a matter of personal preference and taste. Everyone does what is right in their own eyes. That is anarchy and society crumbles.  Second paragraph: Never said there was no pleasure in it; just that their was a cost that is hidden from your eyes. I could never get you to drink poison if I was upfront about the effects. But if I kept that information from you and packaged it good enough; it wouldn't be hard Case in point; homosexuality. harmless? The average life expectancy for a gay male is 45yrs almost half of heterosexual males. There really needs to be more truth in advertising for the sexual revolution. It has brought freedom to no one; only bondage.  Third paragraph: We get back to the real question don't we? What is it ? If it's not human than no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is sufficient. About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex. That troublesome problem of procreation again.  Fourth paragraph; there is that question again; what is it? just a group of cells or a human being in the early stages of life. If it's human, it's murder. hence the parallel.  Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions. The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children. About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what? there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country. that's why most couples adopt from overseas.  Sixth paragraph. If perfection is your standard then yes prohibition doesn't work. Prohibition does work, that's what every law is, a prohibition. It's sounds like you are arguing again for anarchy. To that I say; truth in advertising please.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex""  Really, you just substantiated my previous claim to being numb. Sex is used to sell everything these days. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.  About the choice and sex ed. I'd rather we told the kids the true cost of premarital sex. instead of lie to them. Oh yeah little Johny you can play with fire, just follow these simple steps and you'll be just fine and hey here is some firecrackers to make it more fun. Now let me show you how to make a really cool fire using gasoline. Come on! Let's help kids choose what is best for them, and it's not broken hearts, STDs, single motherhood and the whole list of other stuff that goes along with it. About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns. A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest. Don't believe me. Watch the interview Dr. Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution. I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:  Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy. How did you get here?  Ted Bundy: Pornography. I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied. The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it. Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.  About the study; I don't dispute it. Of course it's failing that's my point. It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain. I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.  Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine. Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be. But that's just your personal preference isn't. If you really believed that morality was subjective you would go sit under a tree and talk to no one, but you don't. You try and persuade people that your view is the correct one, but why I ask?",0

"A fetus is NOT a human, just a mass﻿ of tissue  No, we have a mind  Abortion is safer than childbirth  HA! In the same way that murder is safer than living.  No, it's less dangerous to abort than give birth, wth^^  The number of murders are relatively small. Should we no legalize murder, rape, and theft?  Fair enough  Then why do we have laws against murder? child rape? torture? assault? grand larceny? etc.?  Those are not morals, morals are more of opinions, these are really not opinions   To say that a fetus is merely an extension of its parent needs some substantiation.  A fetus is like a parasite, should a mother have no choice?  Should this have a bearing on its endorsement as legal by the state?  Yes, it could cause a lot of crime, which the state doesn't want, and it would be more dangerous  HA! In the same way that mass genocide prevents accidental deaths.  I suppose...",1

"In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.   In order to be 'sacred' or human you need to have human DNA.  In order to be a unique organism/lifeform (multicellular or unicellular) you need unique DNA or perhaps even RNA in the case of viruses.  Having a unique genome as does the foetus (and its identical twin(s) possibly) means that the foetus(es) is(are) a seperate biological entity(ies) from it's/their mother.  That is the crux of that argument...hope that clarifies.  Yes plants bacteria and other organisms effectively clone themselves in certain hermaphrodite self fertilizing or mitosis related situations...but even the clone will not have 100% of the parent DNA.  The laws of entropy and biolological mutation demand that...or evolution would never have occurred.  Every organism is unique...if only very slightly.",0
"Ok, the problem with jstantall is his belief system is clouding all of his arguments.  First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.   Secondly, we don't even need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it. It's not as if the world's population is dwindling, we actually don't need any more unwanted babies coming into this world! We've got enough of the babies that are actually wanted and we also have enough of those who aren't wanted and have become a burden on society because of their natural tendencies to commit crimes, so if you want to save actual lives and not potential lives, then make wars illegal, make climbing Mt.

Them causing unwanted pregnancies is just as bad as people that would deny a woman an abortion. People taking away the right to have an abortion. Screw the ""morals"" your thinking about.

It should not be used as a form of birth control. If you don't want a child, don't have sex. Simple as that.  BUT, then the issue of rape comes into play. Along with the health of the mother at risk.

"Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married   Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity.   Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion…  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murder….I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know…   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.",1
"well, heres what i think. its ok to abort an unborn child because it is the parents decision to do so. now, once the baby is actually a living creature in your stomach besides just the fetus, it maybe then could be considered illegal since you are killing a baby, not a fetus. so say the fetus develops into an actuall baby at, i dont know 6 months? am i right, wrong? but when its an actuall  baby  and then you abort, then it may be considered murder, so.. all right i'll just break it down  abortion of a fetus:legal  abortion of a baby:  possibly  wrong",1
"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13.   Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods. You should help everyone stay healthy and alive.   I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted.",0
"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage. We set high standards for our children's education and hold them to it. Why not set high standards for them sexually also, since nothing curtails an education like a pregnancy. Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.  There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.",0

"the truth of the principle is self evident.? You mean that, in your opinion, the principle is false, right? First, logically explain me why do you think this is absolutely false, as in, there's absolutely no situation in which this could be true, no matter which other factors are involved.   No, the principle of pro-abortion is: “Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.” The principle is true to fact; it is not false to fact. My assertion is indicating the ethical standard of pro-abortionists. I am not saying that their principle is good or just, I am affirming the principle of their agenda.  Now, consider the principle of the anti-abortionist: Human fetuses and embryos are not sacrificial.  Does this help?      Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion... I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society. At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be ""banned"". This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it. I just came into this one because I saw your comment about criminals and the undebatable, so now I'm here just looking forward to seeing you logically prove that there's absolutely no situation in which sacrificing a human embryo is the less of two evils. I'm looking forward to a debate.   I’ll reply to this part after we clearly understand one another about the truth of the principle of pro-abortion. This is a fair approach.",0

Abortion should be illegal.Because it not fair to those babies that are being killed for the fault of those adult and I think that that everybody deserve chance to life .,0
Even if a zygote or early term fetus was a person (which it isn't)...  And even if that person had all the rights that other people have (which it doesn't)....     I    sure as hell don't have the right to commandeer someone else's body against their will for nine months to keep myself alive and neither does a fetus. The only way to argue that a woman doesn't have the right to terminate a pregnancy she doesn't want is to declare her body to be a piece of property that she doesn't have the right to final say over the use of. And it's just that simple.,1
"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life. Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?",0
"I'm attacking your illogical mind and your silly arguments! If that's a personal attack, then I guess that's what it is!  Ok so you're not calling for abortion to be outlawed, why then are you arguing for their side? You should argue for our side or at the very least choose the ""it depends"" option! I know you want to educate (as do I), so educate, and if that works out well in the future you won't find it necessary to ban abortion!  I'm not defending anybody with my outrageous suggestions. It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. It has more educational value then a ban on abortion. Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child. Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?  The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work. It doesn't work to educate, it simply makes it ... what did you call it? ah yes... ""the next underground drug"".",1
"Any Federal law on abortion is inherently illegal because the Federal government has no authority to regulate abortion. The States individually have the power to. I would be ecstatic if every State in the Union outlawed abortion, just like murder is outlawed.     Abortion isn't murder. A foetus is not a person in the meaningful sense of the word.",1
Proof that aborting a fetus is proper justification of killing   It's potential life. There's nothing to prove. It doesn't have any rights.  .  No doubt you'll disagree and all I can say is that I respect your point of view. The question is: Would you be able to say the same?,1
"even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life   A couple critical points:  This    http://blog.bioethics.net/baby.jpg   Is not equal to this   http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain/ uploads/1/foetus.jpg    Or this   http://topnews.net.nz/images/Embryo.gif   A baby is not a foetus or an embryo. The words are not interchangeable. When a woman is pregnant, a baby isn't sitting in her womb for nine months already developed. Calling it a baby is a way to emotionally hijack the topic. It's like calling hamburgers ""puppies"" in order to make us vegetarians.  Second point: A foetus is not a life. It hasn't lived in the outside world yet and formed an identity.",1
Really check up back on the responses list and furthermore didn't you say there is no life in the fetus so why don't you trying answering why is there a double homicide charge there for the death of the fetus and the mother? So you are saying you asked this question so are a profile or prochoice because that question is a pro life question.,0
"But you posited the ""can't think, see, feel, etc."" You supplied that and you endorsed it by posting it. Notice how you did that. Can't get out by saying that your characterization was part of a criticism - it was still   your  characterization.  A clump of cells in utero is not a ""child."" That's why medical science has words like ""zygote"" and ""blastula"" and ""embryo"" and ""fetus.""  If you are asking for my personal opinion on abortion, which you seem to be, it is that abortion is a highly imperfect solution to a very real problem; but that until we have developed and agreed as a society to disseminate a completely 100% effective, safe, and pragmatic method of birth control complete with age-appropriate sex education AND eliminated rape and abuse or coercion of children, then the societal costs of limiting abortion access much further than it already is (and it IS limited; states can regulate it after the first trimester and can ban it completely once the fetus reaches viability, and can also determine which procedures will and will not be permitted) are simply too great. Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary. This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them.",1
"By the end of the 1st trimester a baby can think, see, hear, remember, and many other things.  What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering baby nine weeks after birth?  Tell me! I want to know.  An abortion doctor failed to abort a baby and he was born alive. So the doctor took the baby and killed him. The doctor was not charged with murder but was charged with the failure to abort the baby.",0
"I support what you say...but I would add this....when a child is concieved...there is nothing potential about it. It is already a living human being.  And I would ask you to think about the rape and incest clause in your position.  Let me ask you this.........if you believe a human life starts at conception, how is death right for even a child of rape? If you walked into a nursery full of babies and the nurse told you that one out of the twentys mother was raped...would you be able to pick that child out? Life is life and although rape is a violent act...so is abortion. So rape is the first wrong....and then on top of that abortion is another. The woman can live with two crimes. That is the same as incest. If you are pro life that means you value ALL LIFE, not just some.  If you are pro-choice and think that abortion should be legal even though you think its gruesome and wrong.....then you are not pro-life. Being pro-life is being against abortion period...unless the woman is dying on the table...and then in most cases both can be saved.",0
No it isn't stupid. A person shouldn't be allowed to kill a future child. They are willing enough to create the child and I believe that they need to own up to their own responsibilities. It was their choice to tango and they need to pay up for it. God wanted the child there for a reason. There is always adoption as an option!,0
"Jeesh, why are all you pro-lifers on this debate so incredibly dense?  You completely missed the point of my billions of sperm argument.  I was shooting down a specific argument in the pro-holier-than-now-I-refuse-to-mind-my-                                        own-business  arsenal.  And that is the dramatically flawed  potential  life argument.  The only argument pro-life has is that the cluster of cells is alive.  Okay fine, I'm through arguing that. You guys think you know more than science so obviously I'm not going to convince you otherwise.  What I  can  argue though is that  if  the tragedy here is the  potential  life lost. Then it is logically irrefutable that lost sperm is just as tragic.  Therefore, masturbation should be illegal, sex with your wife if she is barren should be illegal, sex if you're shooting blanks should be illegal, wet dreams should be illegal, etc.  Regardless of the numbers involved, a potential life is still a potential life.  So logically, if abortion is banned, so should (by pro-lifer logic even) all those things listed.  There's no way for you to escape that. Not that your arguments have ever been bound by logic thus far.",1
"""Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,"" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.""  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   ""The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists""  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  ""no law respecting an establishment of religion""  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that ""other"" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future. Also, the supreme court does not have the right to categorize any believe except in legal matters, so they can say that agnosticism is a religion but that REALLY isn't true.   Try again.",1
"I'm against abortions for the most part; I don't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control as with upwards of 80% of the cases. There are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions.  On the other hand, there are many instances where birth control has failed, cannot be taken due to allergies, or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a woman’s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy.  As for not being able to sustain a baby financially, emotionally, or intellectually, adoption is an option, saying that you want to abort because you didn't  feel  like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and shouldn't be encouraged or supported.",1

"Do you actually read anything anyone types? I said babies as young as 22 weeks have survived hence I think they need to lower the gestation period.    without intervention no baby could survive birth without help   Seriously? Woman have been giving birth on their own for thousands of years. People still do. Gone are the days in America and the UK where you would crouch down in a field and push you're little sprite out. But more and more woman are opting for a natural intervention free home birth. And that's JUST in developed countries. In poorer countries they generally just get on with it.   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life?   I'm not, the mother of the child is. And if she can't feed herself let alone provide for a child and she decides to abort that's her choice and perhaps a sensible one.   You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   When did I say no one has a right to live? You're acting like I perform abortions on a daily basis. I said it's up to a mother if she wants to abort her child, I didn't say it's up to me.   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society   Are you seriously comparing me to the Nazi that is Hitler? Really? Because I support a woman's  choice  to abort. You mad? You seem it.   Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.    Can we just make it perfectly clear that I do not control worldwide abortion. Nor am I responsible for abortion. Nor do I make a choice for anyone to abort. Why are you blaming me for every abortion a woman decides to have because I believe she has the right to that choice? You have read way too much into a small paragraph I wrote. I simply gave reasons why a woman might choose to abort and supported that. I don't remember saying ""HEY YOU THERE! ABORT YOUR BABY IT MIGHT BE FAT!"".   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?   What? I've never made a choice for anyone to live or die or wanted/had the right.   It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, t is a fact that the eggs in a female is human   Does that mean if someone masturbates they are aborting a human life? Does that mean when a woman menstruates she is aborting a human life? They are not human until they meet, implant and develop.    I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts   Stop talking to me about conception, I've had a child I know how it works.   What is the goal of every abortionist?   To do what they  feel  is right for them and their unborn child.  Let me ask you a question now. I have contraceptive coil in to stop me from getting pregnant. Do you think I am aborting human life?",0

"You say;  There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.  But to answer your question about the role of government in these affairs please consider the following:   ""We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""   Taking the life of another person is an injustice, destroys domestic tranquility, destroys general welfare and robs the individual of the blessings of liberty, If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?  This is how our Founding Fathers saw it:   ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness""  Please note the use of the word ""all"" The decision handed down in Roe vs Wade stripped a whole class of people their rights by denying their humanity.  This ruling goes against the very Constitution itself; It is a disgrace. As I said earlier it turns the law on it's head, the very law it is supposed to uphold.   It appears this court has become destructive of the purpose for which it was founded and according to the Deceleration of Independence it is our duty to do something about.",0
"..and you think its ok to just kill it for no reason.    I think you should go back and see if I said it is okay to kill a bay in the womb for no reason. Just to have fun or if killing someone makes you happy. Did I tell that anywhere? No..    Could you make a list....?   The fetus is poisoned.   The pregnancy goes wrong.  Either the mother or the baby can be saved.   99% are for social reasons,   I wasn't here to defend myself, but I told you I'm not 'for' such abortions. They must be stopped.   It is sad that you do not value the life in the womb.   I'll tell you what is sadder. It is sad that you do not wanna see the other side of the possibilities. Why abortions are sometimes important. You might believe just right out that I have no value for life in the womb. I don't think you can just say that cuz you call yourself pro-life. Value must exist. For life inside the womb and outside.   I've been telling you constantly that I'm just trying to explain that I do agree with some of your thoughts, just not all. There must be exceptions. Not easy, but essential one's. You cannot tighten the rules so hard that the humanity you are fighting for has no easy solution.",1

"Well, the question is what makes us a person, and what makes us special above those beings which are okay to kill (most animals, insects plants etc...). I would argue that it's our ability to think and feel at a higher level.   An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people and therefore must be put into a separate category then a fully formed person.  Considering your ignorance on the topic of biology that you demonstrated in the evolution debate, I would not be surprised if you were unaware of this, but if you don't believe me I would be happy to provide evidence (or you could save me the trouble and trust me).  The question then becomes: at what point does the unborn embryo/fetus gain the rights of a full grown person? There are two extremes:  1) The moment after conception.  2) The moment of birth.  My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops. How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current ""all or nothing"" one that is all too common.",1

"Personally i think that people should have the ability to make there own choice. If people are against abortion then they should simply not have abortions but i dont feel its right for people to take the choice away from those that do want them.   The reason i believe the choice for abortion should be there is that its better to abort an unwanted child than have it born into poverty and have it suffer immensely with hunger, etc. Also if an unwanted child is born because abortion wasnt an option. That child grows up without love, care, etc and again brings them into a cruel and punishing world with no love or support system also putting them at risk of depression later in life.  It may seem cruel or unfair to abort a child but honestly its far more cruel and unfair to bring a child into a world of poverty, hostility, hatred and other situations and emotions that often surround having an unwanted child.  Starvation was mentioned above,   Whats more cruel aborting a child (no pain or suffering) or having a child that you cant feed that ends up starving to death (which is one of the most excruciating deaths).",1

"1. The argument I was trying to make is that the Left seems to be more concerned about saving trees than they are HUMAN BEINGS. Thats another ""debate"" I guess.  2. OK not an argument here but I would appreciate some clarification...is it empathy or self awareness we are waiting for before we call them human? The reason I am asking is because it was my experience with my son that he almost immediately could sense his mothers emotional state and reacted in kind. He recognized both my wife's and my voice and music that he heard while in the womb.  3. I somewhat agree on this one in that if the birth risks the life of both the mother and the baby then there is no choice. I will admit I would anguish over a decision like that for the rest of my life.  As far as rape goes...while it is certainly not the fault of the mother that it happened to her it is also not the fault of the child.  4. I understand that but remember ""when your enemy makes you angry ...they win"" Someone really smart and famous said that but for the life of me I cant recall who.

"""The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.""  I want to take issue with what you said here.  How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals. I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.  Most women suffer silently if they have had abortions. This is not acceptable table talk at the dinner table or any table for that matter. Not many woman I know want to talk about what they did…who wants friends and family to know they killed a family member? No women do not report it…they don't talk about it. They try to FORGET IT.   This is not so easy. Last Sunday was Right to Life Sunday and our pastor gave a sermon on this. I can only imagine how many women were sitting there who had had an abortion and were suffering. Its why most pastors won't even touch the issue. Lets not make women feel bad. Lets hide it.  I work with a group Silent No More. We minister to women and families and friends who are suffering from abortions. Abortion affects not just the woman but her family…that is if she tells them she had an abortion. I have worked in this field for over ten years…and the stories and tears I have seen…is unbelievable.   Do not say women do not suffer. That is propaganda that pro-aborts, that Planned Parenthood wants people to think. If you asked the majority of women however if they think about it…regret it you would be shocked…that is if they had the guts to admit again they had one.   Its funny isn't it that…the most performed surgical procedure in America…and we don't talk about it. How many women tell family and friends…hey can't meet for lunch going to get an abortion.

"It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.   That's called discrimination based on level of dependency. It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence. You protect the weak, not exploit or kill them.   It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call ""potential"" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a ""a clever rhetorical trick"" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day? I hope your kidding because of course it would. That's why we ban things, to stop them. And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.   your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.   Well, let's see. Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead. And that death came by willful intent, not an accident. In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide.

"Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked (Psalm 82:3-4).

Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? (Proverbs 24:11-12).  Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? (Job 31:15).  Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God (Psalm 22:9-10).  For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:13-16).  This is what the LORD says—he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you...(Isaiah 44:2).  Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all you who remain of the house of Israel, you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, and have carried since your birth. Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you (Isaiah 46:3-4).  And now the LORD says—he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength (Isaiah 49:5).  The word of the LORD came to me, saying, ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations"" (Jeremiah 1:4-5).  When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy"" (Luke 1:41-42, 44).  SO THE BIBLE VERSES HAVE SPOKEN THIS IS WRONG  BUT...",0
"I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   You said  the man allowed his sperm to fertilze her egg. blame the man?   I would blame the man if he aggresively allowed his sperm. Meaning, it was rape.   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.   And i know that the sperm don't ask permission. I don't understand what you mean by that question. ???  I honestly downvoted you and i thought some more afterwards. I gave your vote back (don't really much care if you care for votes) but i wanna when is pregnancy accidental?   Sperm comes out due to orgasm. So the man can predict when the sperm comes out or not. Which mean it is not an accident. If somehow a man get out his sperm without feeling anything...i would consider that an accident. I am going to make a debate about it.",1
"http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/ fetaldevelopment.html    (This law in no way magically makes a fetus any more or less sentient. If I made a law that toasters were human, it would not make it so.)  You do not make the laws. This statement has little if nothing to do with the fact that people with your mentality decide what they want the law to be when they want it to be that way.  And i clearly did state that it is the issue of where the ""Fetus"" is. If the ""fetus"" was to be in an egg outside of the women, your argument would no longer stand. The only reason you think it is right to kill an unborn child is because the fetus is a cluster of both the womens cells and the mans sperm in the body of a women. If it were to be a cluster of cells in an egg your form of logic would fall apart, because it is no longer part of the women.",0
"These little unborn infants are also living things as we are and when women kill them, it is the almost the same as killing an adult or a child. I can say that God is creator of everything and when we kill unborn babies we destroy his creations.  According to the wordds of Nattyc ""Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides."" abortion is a selfigh decision and I absolutely agree with this statement. We must think about other people, especially about the closet ones. At the time of pregnancy the unborn baby of the wonam is the closest person to her. Women have to appreciaete and save it.",0
That is not even the argument. We are debating abortion not the war in iraq.,0

"I think that you shouldn't have more than.... 3 abortions. Birth control... there's an idea!   I'm against abortion with the exception of rape and ABSOLUTE emergencies. I don't know... I've never been in that situation before, but accidents happen to everyone. So it's mos def possible.",1
"Abortion isn't killing babies like most people think. A fetus in the early stages of development is really just a soup of cells lumped together in one spot. It doesn't have the ability to think or feel pain as it doesn't have a brain yet.   Sometimes abortion would be the best option for the mother. If a woman had been raped and got pregnant as a result of that, she has all the right to abort if she wants to. If a woman doesn't have the economic resources to support the child, abortion is also an option. Sure, some people say adoption but a lot of kids spend their whole lives in a shelter because nobody adopted them. Can you imagine how much mental pain they go through? How much they've suffered? If this situation is bound to happen, the best option would be to abort the unborn fetus before it has the capability of suffering.",1
"Why does a single cell ""deserve"" a chance to live? A single cell is insignificant. It will not suffer if it is destroyed. Life will go on without it. If I were killed as a cell I simply would not exist. No big deal. It would not have bothered me because ""I"" did not yet exist. A single cell has no consciousness and thus destroying it is no big deal.",0
"i believe that it is wrong but that i also think that it should be legal because some people don't have any control over getting pregnant because of rape. and they just are not ready to have a child because or age, finances or both. it also needs to be legal because women and or men will take it into their own hands and do it themselves therefore inflicting damage upon themselves as well possibly permanent damage. and maybe even death to the mother. abortions have to be legal or all hell will break loose and the death rate will increase substantially",1
I agree 100%. This is a cultural issue and not a political one.,1
There are good people of good conscience on both sides of this argument. Isn't that a great indication that the government should butt out and let people make their own decision based on their own beliefs?  We on the pro-choice side are content to let anti-abortion people who are faced with unwanted pregnancy decide what they will do based on their own beliefs.   We think you should be free to live your lives according to your beliefs. We think we should too.,1
Killing an unborn baby is murder it is still a life why does it make a difference if the baby is born or unborn it is still a baby and a life.,0
"Not to mention that much of our legal system isn't based on precrime (some exceptions of course). For example, drinking alcohol won't get you fined for possibly driving drunk. Shooting your rifle in a forest won't get you fined for possibly shooting an endangered species.",1
"Let's assume that we don't know when life begins or at what point those cells in the mothers womb become human. And let's say we can't answer the question, what is it. If we take all the arguments for abortion and weigh all the objections then I have only one question. If we don't know the right or wrong answer to the question of abortion.  Why not err on the side of life?   If we don't know, and this debate demonstrates that, then why not use caution and restraint? It's seems to me that if this issue of abortion is ""debatable"" then it would be unwise to throw open the gates of permission.   What if we are wrong and it turns out that we have actually snuffed out the life of over 45 million children? I think the guilt of that would have a more profound affect on our nation than thousands of women who die from back ally abortions. See, in abortion we as a nation are complicate in the act because we as a nation sanctioned it. In the back ally abortion we have no guilt because the parties acted contrary to our law. If you think nations don't have guilt, ask a German about the Holocaust. The don't like to talk about it for obvious reasons.",0
"it is simple - innocent simply means free of blame, not guilty, not in the wrong, etc.",1
It is a living homo sapien cell. It deserves a chance to live. What if you were killed as a cell? Think about it.,0
"There is nothing ""innocent"" about an embryo. This is an appeal to emotions and makes your argument void. Secondly, the only thing that is ""killed"" during the expulsion of the contents of a reproductive organ is a process. Thirdly, ""human being"" has a specific definition legally and medically and in all cases, a fetus is excluded.",1

"Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.   So... asexually reproducing life isn't sacred now? In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.  Fruit cells envelop seeds (usually) and they are alive. The only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall. Both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life. In the case of a fruit, the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs. In the case of a foetus, it may grow into a human. Both have this potential, but they are not presently realised.   This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...   I never said that apples were independent life forms, but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it.  Also, if you want to get into the biology of it, the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells, a relationship which evolved over many millions of years. Multicellular life is, in a sense, many cells working together through evolved inter-dependence. So in a historical sense, yes, your testes have cells which are animals (animals need not be multicellular) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter-dependent.",1
"There's just so many things wrong with your post... let's list them. ;)  1. I agree, human life is not something to ditch. Better it be aborted first.  2. On this issue, she's as wrong as possible  3. The bible is garbage. I would sooner trust my arguments to logic than some dogmatic fiction novel. If you had any intelligence, you would do the same.  4. We aren't a race, we're a species. Unless you're trying to say that it's only wrong for one race to get abortions... XD   5. ""Sorry nation"" is a non-cognitive opinion, therefore has no base in reality.  6. There is no shortage of orphans. Parents wanting children but can't conceive can easily adopt if they want to any time. Your argument is moot.  7. No, you're just egotistical and assume everything you personally don't approve of is your business.  8. There were no ""toes"" being stepped on. She made a logical error and I corrected her.   Wow, literally every sentence in your post made some kind of fallacy. Some even made two.   That. Is. Hilarious. ;)",1
Pro-aborts have a big problem. They celebrate abortion but don't want the label that goes with it. They don't want people to think they condone killing….  And your right…..they probably feel worse about killing those bugs with their cars…then they do living human beings.,0
"Because it's wrong to destroy  innocent  human life regardless of intelligence. If you're saying it's perfectly fine to kill non-intelligent human life, then where is the cut off? Comatose patients? The mentally handicapped? I'm going to guess you'd cut the line just after the comatose (making euthanasia moral), but even then, it's  human life , which I believe is worth saving, not losing.",0
"The balanced opinion is generally the most correct in discussions that are not black and white, such as this one.  Such is why I believe that it's okay to abort up until a certain point in the pregnancy. After a certain point, it becomes the murder of a human being.",0

No on ehas the right to take away   someones life or decide if they live   or not. by getting rid of an unborn baby it is   destroying potential and you will always  think of what could have been.,0
"Finally I forgot to ask... You believe the male should have a right in the choice of abortion. What if the male wanted an abortion and the woman didn't? I assume you wouldn't be so happy about that right then. That's part of the reason why men don't generally have a  legal say , baring in mind most woman consult with the father and come to a mutual agreement anyway. You also argue that pregnancy is entirely down the woman yet you believe she shouldn't have the final say on the child. So which is it, is the woman solely responsible for pregnancy and the child or are both sexes equally responsible?",1
"It's not ""life unworthy of life"", it's actually ""POTENTIAL life!""  Until the fetus can actually survive outside of the womb, it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body. Once it reaches the stage of about 20 weeks when it should stand a slight chance of survival and maturing into a person, then it should be made illegal. But before that time, it only has the POTENTIAL, nothing more. A potential is just that.",1

"If it is not considered life when the egg is fertilized and is starting to grow, the when does it become a life. Where is the line between a incomplete mass of cells and a life.

And also some fetus is dead because of it. A fetus is superior to spermatazoan.,0
"If you mean disgusting as in 'gross to watch,' then we're in agreement, but that doesn't turn an opinion into a fact.    It's just a tad more deep seated than an opinion. Disgust can be evoked without visual stimulus or having formed anything like an opinion. For example with extremely foul odors. An odor that is  in fact  disgusting to some, others may find that they can tolerate. The fact that some people build a tolerance and can endure without experiencing disgust doesn't make it any less factual that the smell is disgusting.   More than the thoughts of people actually faced with getting abortions?   If someone feels like they are ""faced with getting an abortion"" when they really aren't, perhaps thoughts like those I express will be considered more weighty than those expressed by people like you who as I see it are advocates of abortion as a form of birth control.   If by necessary, you mean something that logically follows and literally cannot be other way, then even your 'necessary' abortions are not necessary.   True, there are always other options, though they may not be immediately perceivable. I don't use the word necessary in such a manner as to retard recognition of the possibility of better options. Obviously earlier on some things were thought to be necessary that were later proven not to be.   After all, people can always 'choose' to let themselves die slow, painful deaths.   No they can't, not always. :)  Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   You already have. Unless you did actually mean necessary in the logical sense, you've decided 'necessary' means 'necessary to prevent the mother from suffering death or serious injury.'   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives. It's not that the alternatives don't exist, it's that they are not sought out with enough diligence. If you want to use logic so strict that it renders the use of the term ""necessary"" pointless, I'll have to agree that no medical procedures are necessary. You could however submit to common sense and realize I was referring to a determination of necessity made by a licensed medical professional.   Things that would make doctors hacks according to you:  Correcting birth defects such as extra fingers, tails, or deviated septa  Cosmetic reconstructive surgery for accident victims  All exploratory surgeries   Sorry, I left out ""improving"". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   Things that wouldn't:  Abortion (unless you can show me that pregnancy does not reduce the mother's health from its pre-pregnancy level, thus making abortion a procedure that restores health)   There are countless factors that come into play when considering the overall health of a person, and I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman. If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.",0
"If abortion were to be made illegal we could safely say that the government has taken away our right to our own bodies. Not to mention the higher death rates that would be caused by the ""back alley abortions"" that were extremely prominent when abortion was outlawed.",1
I am really against abortion. I know that most of the abortions are cause by the teens because they arent prepared to raise a child. First of all i dont think thats a good reason to kill a baby. There are always other options not just that. I come from a family of 10 people and my mom raised us all by her self aborting never crossed her head. So what im basecly trying to say is that aborting is not a way to solve things so i think it should just be illegal.,0
"Suicide is not banned but at the same time, the state has every right to keep a person in custody if there is a chance that the person will hurt himself or there is a strong likelihood that the person is at risk of committing suicide. Let us not concentrate on the federal level as we are concentrating on state levels. The duty of the federal level is to prosecute and regulate laws that are in the best interest in the people of America not just a specific state. In other words, the federal government cannot and will not intrude upon the laws of a state. Prostitution and suicide are minor issues for them when the security of their country is at stake.",0

"I respectfully think you are wrong.  Hiking is not dangerous really....mountain climbing on the other hand is. You take risks to do it. This is taking responsiblity for your actions...even if the risks you took backfired and became reality. And this is the case for intercourse between a man and a woman. THE RISK IS ALWAYS THERE....unless the woman or the man is sterile. If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection....and that protection broke....how do you think she would feel? Anxious? Worried? If a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man...and later learned she forget to take one the day before...how would she feel? Worried? Sure she would....because mistakes happen...but that does not change the risk factor that she took. The risk was there...and human error, condom malfunctions can happen. How is that the fault of the new life they both created? It is unfortunate, but nevertheless, the life got started.   I dont think it should be individual opinion....it should be what the facts state. And it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being. Now its small, but that does not change its state. A little ant working hard on a hill....has all it needs to live....its small...but the workings of his bodily system works. And a fetus however small...has the same qualities...but is human. The heart starts at around twenty days...and every day grows and something develops. The issue is...does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent. We have people here who are against killing animals for food, but they are pro-abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral. Figure that one out.   If you say they are responsible..is the responsible thing to do is kill it? How responsible is that? Do you think that two wrongs make a right?   You say there should be no laws to enslave the woman, that she should NOT be forced to carry a baby to full term. That means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month. So don't come back and say........""ooops...now I don't mean that...only until its viable.."" And gee when is viablity and what does that matter....the woman does not want it...and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants. Anythink less as i said would enslave her and FORCE HER TO DO WHAT YOU SAY, NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO...in this case our government. How humane is your statement really? Donating blood does not kill anyone.   And in the United States we can really force people to give blood. When someone is arrested for drunk driving...most often they have to give blood. Denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence.  I don't get that you think its immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over their childs, yet believe the mother can kill her child while it is in the womb. ????????  Yours is certainly not the Republican stance thats for sure.",1
"So are you saying it's okay to kill something that could potentionally be someone just like you? I can see how it isn't up to you to decide for anyone else, but do you believe that it's okay?   It doesn't matter what it could become. It only matters what it is presently.",1
A woman's emotional problems post-abortion may well be brought about and exacerbated by pro-life harrassments. A woman going through any emotional difficulties should be supported by the community and/or her family and close friends.,1
"Well, once it is a child, it already is illegal to kill it.  Before the first tri-mester it's a cluster of cells with no more self-awareness than a kitchen table.  So that wouldn't be ""killing a child"" at all.  And don't start with the potential bs. Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing ""potential"" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.  ... 'course judging by your past arguement, I guess you'll try anyway.",1
"The only real advocacy for pro-life is the thought of killing a child. It's living tissue I'll give you that, but would you have a C-section at 2 months and call it a birth? No. Because it's not truly a being yet, is it?  And if you're going to make the argument that stopping a child from existing is murder, in that case, sex without procreation is murder, or for that matter, not deciding to have a child at any point is murder.  The only event horizon would be life at conception. That's purely a religious claim. A conscious human being cannot be contained within 2 cells.",1
"Well tell me, why are you against abortion? And, if you would, react to the remaining post of mine above.",1
"True, and he was providing another options for pregant women.  What exacly is the valid and direct issue of compulsory adoption. Surely you must admit that it does a better job than an abortion?",0
"The father doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months and then have it wreak havoc on his body while he pushes it out of a hole four sizes too small. If he does make the offer to fully support the child without the mother being around, good for him, but he still can't force her to carry and birth it.",1
"Err on the side of life? ERR??? This is not guess work. The fact is we DO know that it's human, we DO know that it's definitely a POTENTIAL life (but not ACTUAL life). We DO know the answer to most of these questions. We just want a choice. Don't word it as if you've sanctioned abortions. You are simply giving people a choice. Put it another way, you haven't taken away their rights to choose.   Holocaust is killing Jews.   Choice to abort a fetus that cannot survive outside the womb until at least week 20 is the same as using a condom or abstaining, or masterbating into the toilet.",1
"It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is ""all"" or ""most"" or even ""vital"" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.   Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion.   I am out-maneuvering you. You only think one step at a time, but I'm several steps ahead of you. Learn to concede when you are off topic and we'll get along fine.   Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us.   How young are you? A teenager? You sure are wide-eyed if you think law and the justice system are about truth.  Juries are made up of peers, average blokes. Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me? Argue in a way that is clear, has few red herrings, and is rational rather than an appeal to feelings.",1
So you say its inhumane but still are pro-choice? What does that say about YOU?,0
"Ok, before you go around saying having an abortion = killing ""somebody"" consider this:  does a pregnant woman need a passport for her belly when she travels? Does the fetus inside of her know anything? Can it make any decisions? What kind of a ""person"" is it? IT'S NOT A PERSON!  Before it can survive outside of its mother's womb, it is not society's choice but the mother's choice. Don't take that choice away from the mother.",1

"Um, have you ever had sex? lol It's kind of fun. Not too mention it's great for relationships.   Sex isn't just for reproducing anymore. We've made it where we can have sex for pleasure.   It's narrow-minded to just think of sex just as reproducing. It's also no fun if you think of it just like that.",1
"That sounds like YOUR solution to a minority of people. Don't you dare make everyone abide by the minority's rules. If it was a simple answer, it wouldn't be such a huge issue.   Abortion isn't a form of birth control like condoms or the pill, for those directly involved it's a difficult choice that they have to make because bringing a human life up is no easy task. It's not like having a pet (and even that is a big ask because not all pet owners are responsible).  Again, it's the choice of those directly involved. It doesn't affect anybody else's life, so leave it alone.",1
"I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   How is this relevant to the debate at hand?   I am antichoice abortion.   Wait. You're against women and/or parents having a choice, but you are pro-abortion now? Or that you want abortion without giving people a choice?   It is simply using the space to grow.   Not only that. The unborn fetus also uses it's mother's body for nutrition.   It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother.   And thus, the mother has the right to  un invite it.   I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear.   If you say this, that means you're deluded.   Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion.   Again, short answer is ""yes"", long answer is ""no"".   That is not pro-life   You aren't pro-life as well if you will not allow a mother, whose life is threatened by the pregnancy, to abort the baby.   ""I am pro-choice but I am against abortion""…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.   You're myopic and deluded.   Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?   No. I am pro-choice but I do not condone abuse, slavery or genocide.   I am not happy.   I don't give a damn.   I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold.   So what? That says nothing about whether or not they  ought  to be done.   Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position.   I would say the same to you, but I realised now that you're myopic, closed minded and intolerant of the beliefs of others.",0
"NOPE...... we talk about life here... and fetus don't have a life... they don't have heart.. and they don't even have any brain to think( in young age of pregnancy i mean..), whether they agree to eliminate by someone or not..( yeah, human right..)  so... i bring new proposal in this case..

"Abortion should be consider illegal. it is not the unborn child's fault that they was to be given life. the ones who conceded the child are at fault. even if the child is unborn the child should still have every other right to live as any other human being for the child is a human being too. and it would be murder and disgrace to kill a child that has yet to be born and to kill a innocent child who has convicted no crime unless you call being alive and wanting to live a crime, then in that case everyone in the human race has committed a crime.",0

that what you are killing is a living human being.   Not at the stake of another Human Being who already has responsibilities. And whose pain is worse and shared bigger. You kill someone in the womb is cruel. When you do not kill someone in the womb when required is also cruel.,1
"It is life, this is true, but it is not a human being. You said yourself, it has 'potential' to be a human being, and I agree, but this alone does not make it a human being until a certain stage in the pregnancy. The abandonment of logic is to consider it  more  then just a potential human being.",1

"That is the problem with people like you isnt it?  You don't see the bigger picture.   Of course I do. I just don't consider it particularly important to the argument. How many abortions do women naturally enjoy every year due to the body's natural abortion process? Women must be natural serial killers by your reckoning.   A human life is a human life period, regardless of developmental stage or cognitive ability.   Touchy-feely absolutes like this have no place in a rational discussion. I could very well argue that human life is merely a clockwork mechanism regardless of developmental stage or cognitive ability.   You remind me of Hitler in fact...he destroyed human beings he did not consider human too....perhaps you will meet him in Hell.....you could be lovers ;)   Do you think you are important enough to me that I'd let your comments provoke any kind of emotional feeling? Cold, unfeeling, ice. That is me. Save the insults for someone that cares.",1
"Abortion is the killing of a child. No one should be willfully killed, be it at 1 week or 100 years. When I had my first ultrasound with my son, I was 5 weeks pregnant, which means I had become pregnant 3 weeks prior. My son had a heartbeat. How can anyone anyone anyone stop a beating heart on purpose? Your decision should happen BEFORE you find yourself in this position. If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives? It's because they know they killed a human and that will rest on their hearts for life. If only their child had such an opportunity. For those of you who wrote that there is no God, and were angered by such a defense, I will pray for you. Because without faith, you really have nothing.",0
"Well, if you have a lame duck congress who stonewalls him on everything; I think it would be reasonable to blame them.  But that's not the question at hand is it? The question is; what is being killed in an abortion? that's the only one that matters.",0
"Nobody has the right to another person's body. A woman has the right, for lack of a better term, evict. It is her body, she does not have to gestate for 9 months if she doesn't want to. Arguments about having sex mean you accept pregnancy are ludicrous.  Look at it this way. We don't require parents to give up their organs, or their blood, or their extra kidney, or even their bone marrow in order to save the life of their 1 year old child. If that child needed a transplant or it dies, we do not force the parents to donate. even something like Bone marrow, that will not kill them. We don't force anyone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want to.  So why would we force a woman to keep the fetus alive. It uses her kidneys, blood, lungs, etc. Pregnancy can cause health problems and complications worse than being a bone marrow donor, or even a kidney donor. Why would the law force a woman to go through pregnancy until the fetus is born, but not require the parents to keep the born child alive? Why does the fetus get special protection that a child does not?   The woman needs to choose to gestate for 9 months, and accept the risks that go with it at every stage. She has the right to change her mind if the risks become to great, or even her awareness of the risks become too great. When she becomes pregnant, she should have the right to research and evaluate the risks of carrying to term consult with her doctor and accept or reject those risks.",1
"Didn't you develop from tissues and cells so what are you referring to? Furthermore if you hurt a person or wound them, does that not involve a damage of the cells, tissues and or organs as well? Isn't that is why they are charged with assault or attempted murder?     You missed the point entirely. Assault isn't a crime because we care about dead cells, it is a crime because we have decided that it is bad behaviour. Same with attempted murder.",1
"What makes a human a human? What makes you think that your definition is accurate?   A human can think, has some level of autonomy, and generally is able to survive on its own. Human is the biology, the culture, the history, shared by us all.  A foetus in its early weeks cannot think, cannot take care of itself at all, can't make choices.

"Somepeople do not agree with what is evil. We are disagreeing with abortion here. I see it as evil, you see it as a good. Where is the gray area?  And rape......in your opinion it is wrong...but what about other cultures?   And Hitler, he killed those who thought inferior and weak. Murder has always existed. But peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented. There are those who think our participation in the ME wars were wrong that they served no good. Others disagree. So evil is in the eye of the beholder. So when you say fight evil with evil.....its subjective, because people might not agree which side is right and which side is wrong. Yet you say there is only one truth. How do you determine what is truth on your own? And should everyone be subjected to YOUR way of thinking?  It is not radical to say something is wrong.  And stop calling me names...you look foolish. Your example is sick. You fall in love with a child.....???? A child is a child...and it is never right to have sex with a child if you are an adult. There are laws to prevent this from happening...to keep children safe..from your way of thinking. Love can destroy people, families and communities.   You said, ""Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.""  FActs about abortion? I doubt that. What facts do you know just curious.   ""You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.""   The fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being. The abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing. That is a biological fact.   So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.  I find it sad that in your post you defend evil. Where is the balance in that?  ""Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness.""  For people who live godless lives it might. For people who do not consider all human life sacred....for those who are moral relativists it might. I find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious. That they lose the right to live while in this state. People who are in comas, under for surgeries...even sleeping is a form of being unconscious. So because a child is in the womb...does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically. When I was pregnant I used to push in on my baby....and prode it until it moved....aware of my touch.   Your view on life is sad. Vegetable people are nothing? You are so so cold. I feel sad for you really, that your worldview IMO of course is so empty. That you would compare a living person to meat. What a cold way of putting it.",0
"Because  it's  a beautiful precious child and every time someone terminates one, they are murdering a future president.

"1. The comparison is a bad one. Neither moss nor lady bugs have human DNA. A human fetus has a distinct human DNA code from its mother. The complexity of an organism during development does not affect what it is; a child is less complex than an adult, but both are human.  2. From the same place they performed life-or-death abortions before: the hospital or doctor's office. Abortion has always been legal in life-or-death cases.  3. Look over at my post on the other side of the debate and refute those points, please. It's not well-established that it's not murder. Truth is not relative to our current laws.  4. Laws are put in place with punishments attached to keep people from doing those acts. Laws will never stop those who flaunt them, only punish those who are caught. That should not stop laws from being in place.  5. Again refer to my points.",0

You scream insincere sanctimony, claiming to have a moral high ground while approving a deed that is the very definition of murder.",1
"And what is a negative circumstance that would meet your appoval?   Is it your business why a woman aborts? My neice was born at 23 weeks.....and babies have lived a few weeks earlier than that. Do you think you could pinpoint the EXACT point in the pregnancy when the fetus is work saving? I would think since abortion kills, that you would want to be right on the money here. Or doesn't it make any difference?  So what is your stance on abortion?",0

"So are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? Then why are you even against abortion? We are talking about a life here not just a fetus. I believe that everyone has a right to live. No fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. In the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt.  If you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. What if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? What is your opinion on that?",0

"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.",1
"They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing.   And there you go. They don't want abortions, they want the option.   So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL   Yes, pretty much. I think religion is bad, but I'd never consider taking it away from people. I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support. Just as Voltaire said  'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' , I feel the same way about abortion.   Nothing is good about abortion.   That's not true.  No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.   We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution   No, you are. I am not American. Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens. When a foetus has citizenship, it gains the right to life. To do that, it must be born. So there you go, another circular impossibility, can't gain protection unless it's born, when it doesn't need protection.",1
"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.   It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.",1

It possess the DNA of a homo sapien, no doubt. But it is not a homo sapien.   It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead.   Didn't I say that I agree it is alive?

"Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.   Is the taking of a life  necessarily  wrong?   Do you think two wrongs make a right?   No. But I don't think that abortion is  necessarily  wrong. It is wrong in some situations, but it cannot be considered to be completely wrong.   Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   But you haven't explained why abortion is wrong. Saying that it is wrong because ""it takes a life"" doesn't say anything because you are making the assumption, without any justification, that taking a life is wrong.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?   I don't think that all life is sacred. I don't believe in the sanctity of life. That is merely an illusion. What you are  really  doing here is ignoring the rights of the mother in favour of the unborn child, whom we don't know will even survive birth or the first few years of its life.   Red Herring?   Yes, it is a red herring. In your previous comment, you haven't asserted how your Oprah Winfrey example supports your argument that abortion is immoral.   Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?   Not necessarily. I haven't made a judgement on Oprah at all so don't you dare put words in my mouth.   Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness, death, dying, troubles?   How does that support your view?   Do you think that mentally challenged, physically challenged people should have been aborted? If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…..should they be aborted? yes or no   Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   That has no relevance to whether the baby should have been aborted or not. Again, you can't abort an born child. That is an illogical statement. It's like asking the question, ""Should Person A, who is a bachelor, have gotten married?"" The question is wrong by definition. Thus, I don't have to answer questions that are logically incoherent in the first place.",1
You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?,0

Should abortion be legal? It was like asking should murdering another person should be legal? I can't see the point why it should be legal in any sense. Abortion = murder. Why? Because you are planning to take the life of another human. Don't tell me that fetuses are not babies because in every single way they are. And if they are human they have all the right to live. You can have them be adopted if you are not ready with the child. Just don't take their first right away from them.,0

"Abortion is taking the life of a living human being. We see society up in arms about animal rights and animal abuse. Isn't abortion really the worst case of child abuse you can think of? Every abortionists task is to dismember, kill in any way possible...the living human child in the womb. Death is the only goal. The fetus might be small but nevertheless science says it is human and it is alive. What is it called when you take someones life without their permission? Isn't this murder? If you defend the womans choice to kill saying it is her choice....then should you enslave her by putting restrictions on when the killing takes place? Thus late term abortions should be legal if you are pro-abortion. When does her right to body sovereignty end?

Two more eyes that will never see.  Two more hands that will never touch.  Two more legs that will never run.  One more mouth that will never speak.  Did you know that by day 30 you had a heart?  Did you know that by day 42 that that your brain ordered your heart to start beating if it hadn't given the order already?  I bet that you didn't know that if there is brain activity doctors consider a patient alive and has the right to continue living  Life starts at the moment of conception and abortion is therefore immoral, wrong and a waste of time",0

"OK first off Abortion IS murder weather you believe it or not it IS.  Example:   Scott Peterson in trial was convicted of TWO murders not ONE but TWO why two though?  He just killed his wife?  His wife was pregnant. The baby inside of his wife was killed in the process of the mother being killed.  If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?!  Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?  Your taking away the life of some creature that has not yet experienced life yet.  The baby moves, blinks, kicks, and squirms inside the mother, this is the sign that it is alive and is capable of understanding of what is doing (not of everything its doing) and human beings do just the same.   So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.   And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?   Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.  Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder.  People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option. It leads to people saying ""Oh I can just get it aborted so I don't have to worry about it."" &lt;- LAZINESS.  We already have enough lazy citizens in the US I don't think we need anymore.",0
"What did this guy just say? It's a simple choice...are you ok with killing a baby while it's growing in the mother. Sure...""stuff"" happens. Move on...just admitt you're killing and say, ""I'm pro-choice"". You killed 1000 bugs on your way to work, you're a killer anyway...live with it. Let humans decide.",0
"Well, if you read my argument towards iamdavidh's argument on potential life in regard to sperm cells, you will understand that there are major differences to what is potential and what is actually fertilizing as we type.  The fact that women consider an abortion as the first choice (or for that matter any choice) is too weak for some people, this includes me.  What individuals fail to see, and admit, is that there is always another option, whether it be putting the child up for adoption or to leave the child in the care of a friend or family member, so that the child has a life and it is still able to give a couple what they actually want.  People are so financial these days that they forget about human rights, something that a child deserves. We can all look at what science determines is a child and what isn't, but it is but some of us, who actually believe and support human life, will look as a fetus as a child, regardless of its understanding and capabilities.  If someone isn't fit or capable of having a child, have safe sex, or if it is too late, give the child to someone who is. Everybody wins.",0
"But who is to say the child may not grow up to be the next Stephen Hawking, or even just a stable, healthy individual. Yes, there is also a chance that they would have a horrible life. But by killing the fetus, you remove ANY chance at all. It would be like the staff on the Titanic walking through the ship and killing every passenger aboard, rather than giving them a chance in the lifeboats or even in the open water (6 survived in the water by the way......Bet they were glad they were given the chance.)",0
"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery.   That we currently do is no argument that we ought to continue.   It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)   If you want to represent prenatal care or the rearing of a child as a waste of resources, I'll leave the untruth of that as self evident.   Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small.   I have a different hunch about these things than you, but I also suspect we can only contrast our opinions here sans any kind of statistical evidence.   Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people.   I don't think so.   A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences.   I am not arguing against the small fraction of abortions that are medically necessary.   There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.    I think I am, considering that most abortions are not by necessity but by choice.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body.   There is no legal basis to support the importance of a fathers right to protect his unborn child.   You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).    I could argue that a woman who willingly engages in the sort of sexual relations that commonly result in pregnancy should thereby confer certain legal rights to the father. It's the beginning of a shared responsibility so there should be shared commensurate rights. If a woman can legally compel a man to be held responsible after birth, he should have some legal say prior to.   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions.   No disagreement from me there.   Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established.   To the contrary...Living beings that don't meet your imaginary criteria, merit protection due to moral concerns. For instance if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents.   A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.  Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).    Having morality based reasons to protect a life form, does not depend on the life form in question being conscious. Even if you could give a logically sound explanation of what consciousness is.",1
"A mothers career should be a factor in a childs life? And yes, it is a life. You were once under 10 weeks old in your mothers womb as well.   Let me rephrase, would you justify a child being treated poorly and judged differently because their mother was raped?",0
"I'm going to take for granted the notion that federal sanctioning of the taking of human life, be it in favor of whatever ""greater good,"" should not be tolerated. If anyone would like to contest this, let me know and I'll elaborate.  While even the most ferocious of pro-borts openly admit that human life is scientifically defined as beginning at conception, others still insist that it is not, and some of their arguments should be taken into consideration.   But while we're pontificating on the nature of human life, it is extremely irresponsible to allow potentially millions of human beings to die in the name of another's convenience. Better to err on the side of life.",0
I am prochoice when the mother's life is in danger and the baby is to young to survive.,1
"Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.  Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.   Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.  views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.   Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.  An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this?   Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.  The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.  Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves.   Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy things  Ted Bundy: Serial killer  Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity.   I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me.   Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.   Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.   About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.   Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place. If you want to debate any of the non-abortion arguments we've been discussing, let's create a new debate, because this long argument full of fifty mini-arguments is just confusing.",1
All arguments against abortion are based on religious views. Quit trying to push your beliefs onto others.,1
"How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   semantics...   Hey, you were the one who wanted to play this game ;)   And I can give many that are not.   Therefore, you are committing the genetic fallacy. Because whether or not the definition comes from the OED has no bearing on whether the definition is true or not. I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.   Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged? I am well justified to go down this road.",1
"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1

"I too have my isses with abortion. I am against the idea of man playing a role in human life (this includes the death penalty), HOWEVER...until there is SCIENTIFIC proof of when life begins, I will support its legality. Religion should NEVER have a role in politics, and there should be no Divine assumptions. I certainly don't wanna see women getting back alley abortions because somebody who believes in ""god"" says its murder. I will also say though that I think abortion is used to quickly and I think there should be a greater stress on alternatives as well as a greater stress on education for pregnancy prevention (and im not talking abstinence). Abortion IS unhealthy for a woman's body, so i would never recommend it. Though, right now, with the info we have, we cannot even consider making it illegal.",1
"So the woman's decision means killing a child, and that should be ok?  How is the fact that the child was conceived through rape, the childs fault? Would you treat this child different after it was born? So, why treat it any different before?

1. Women have a right to do what they want with their body.  2. What if a women is raped and gets pregnant? so she just has to live with a messed up child?  3. The fetus is not really sentient until it comes out,1
it is imoral because it kills a person and every man is created equal also if the mother is a person who would actually be so irresponible as to have unprotected sex when she doesnt want a child then she should have to bear that punishment and should be able to eventually give her child up to adoption,0
"Lets see Hitler killed people. abortions kill people. Wow your right, no correlation at all, a true red herring.  Want to know what Jesus taught about abortion, right and wrong and judging people? Go get your Bible and knock off the dust because it would be wise to ask Him not me.  Final thought; We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God, all of us are going to prison for a long time for comic treason. And since the one we offended is infinite in worth, the debt we owe is infinite also. So consider what infinity minus 10 thousand is, infinity. That's how long it will take to pay the debt.   But that's not the question at hand is it; it's about abortion. And for that there is only one question; what's being killed? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. No one needs justification to remove a tumor do they? But if it's a human being killed in an abortion then no justification is adequate.  So if you think abortions shouldn't be banned, please tell me exactly what is being killed in an abortion,",1
"... you sound like a raving lunatic, you realize that right?",1
"Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it. The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.  I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.  But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death. With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost.",0
"The debate is about abortions, which is about the act of stopping an unwanted pregnancy from developing into a life.

"It not whether it's human. We know it's human. We also know that before at least week 20, it cannot survive on its own. It has all the POTENTIAL of a life, but that's only a POTENTIAL.

"During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?  The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects. The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient. A child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient. I want you to tell me the Holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay. You just can't do that. One can't be wrong and the other right. That is like saying rape is wrong but incest is okay.",0
"No the question is what do you not understand. You are the one saying that an undeveloped human hasn't the rights of a developed human an yet we were all once ""undeveloped"" so we technically have no rights since we were undeveloped. So you would not care if your parents decided that oh we want an abortion because it is undeveloped so it does not have the rights that we developed humans do.     Are you developed or undeveloped (an embryo or foetus)?  This is a binary question. You are either one or the other.  If you are a foetus (you aren't, right?), then you have no human rights.  If you are post-birth, aka a developed human, you have human rights. The rights or lack thereof of one of these categories doesn't affect the other. Rights are granted upon birth.",1
Thank you for your testimony. I'm so glad you spoke up and would strongly encourage you to do it more often. Apart from rape your case is the most often used justification for abortion. And as your existence proves it is not proper justification. I know of a woman ( I can't remember her name) but her mother was rapped. I know of her because she is doing public speaking on this issue of abortion.  You are a testimony to the fact the abortion snuffs out a human life because it would have taken yours. Thank you again.,0
"This is what I derive from your argument:  ""We should not outlaw abortion, we should outlaw unprotected sex. This is because we want to prevent children from coming into this Earth, or kill them off should accidents happen.""  This system is complete and utter BS, and would do more harm than good.  If we wanted to prevent children from being born, we should educate, and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples. This way, we can eventually move past outlawing unprotected sex and stop abortions for good.  What you suggest does nothing to promote any form of childbirth. It doesn't give a single solution that doesn't cause more problems.",0
"That's not what I said. Typical... turning my words into something they are not. How polite of you. What I said is that neutrality is logical because this world is made of almost nothing but it. If you kill a man who attacks you for no discernible reason, how good or evil is that action if he is a devoted, loving father? The fact is that there is little good and evil in the world, something that churchmouse did not seem to understand, thus my explanation of it and neutrality to her.  What you don't understand is that to be neutral isn't to not make a decision. To be neutral is to be aligned in between two extremes. Just because you are aligned in between two extremes does not mean you do not make decisions based off of your alignment. You're not thinking of neutrality, you are thinking of laziness. Or stupidity, perhaps. And for the record, you don't know how I treat my own children. How I treat them has nothing to do with abortion, nor my point on neutrality.   You are correct, you did make an argument of logic, though what you forgot to include in said argument was a wide variety of points that prove that abortion are wrong. If you are saying that abortion is wrong only because it stops people from facing the consequences of unprotected sex, then you are forgetting that there are  far  too many reasons for and against abortion for that to be your leading point.",1

It's still wrong then?   give the baby up for adoption but still be apart of its life   Some people are against adoption in the same way you are against abortion. They simply can't go through with it. And you can't always be apart of it's life once you put it up for adoption, nor do some people want to.     I have noticed that the people that say abortion is right are alive and their parents didnt go through an abortion   ... This is the stupidest argument ever, if any parent did then it would irrelevant. And I have, on many occasions, which my mother had had another abortion when I was conceived. She suffered greatly by deciding to keep me and my twin brother, and I wish she had simply aborted us and lived a better life for herself.",1
ok its not a person until the baby comes out it can kill you to give birth,1
"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.  It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.",1

"You are correct in your assessment of me. Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there.   I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast. Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.  But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound? If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved. And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost. If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me.  “If you love Me, keep My commandments"" John 14:15   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

"You got frustrated with Avesked (however his name spelled) and banned him. That is just like abortions. Your were unprepared for Avesked intelligent rebuttals, and aborted him.

I can't wait till I get banned.",1
Abstinence or any other form of contraception is preventing potential life. You're fighting your natural urge to enable conception of a life. But abstinence isn't illegal.,1
"Yes, this type of stupid hypocracy must be banned!  The parents have right to kill themselves but not their growing babies.  Many countries face a crisis due to this. If the abortio is not a safe mode executed, then it can affect the parent's health too.  Friends, How can you accept the death of an innocent infant who never harmed you?",0
"Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.  Fruits are not multicellular organisms, in the traditional scientific sense...they are a part of an organism...my testes are composed of living cells that respire and excrete but i do not consider them independant animals of their own right...  This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...  Now do you realise how illogical your absurd argument is?",0
"Abortion should definetly be banned! Their is a lot of things to prevent pregnancies such as condoms, birth control and getting your tubes tied! If you know you are not old enough or financially stable to take care of a child then don't have sex, just use protection. Don't just look for the easy way out because of your mistake! i don't get how if you kill somebody then you get charged for murder, and spend the rest of your life in prison....when on the other hand having an abortion is murdering a baby. To me that doesnt make any sense...and some people say but what if the person got raped and ended up pregnant.....well you can give it up for adoption, i feel that women who have abortions are selfish and are only thinking about themselves. They really don't care about what the baby goes through and that is completely wrong!",0
"Yes, it is. A fetus is, by definition, ""an unborn or unhatched vertebrate in the later stages of development"" If the fetus has not been born, it is still a fetus. The fetal stage of growth occurs after the embryonic stage and will continue until birth.   Definition is from Word Web",1
your right they shouldnt be haveing sex but they do and they are not about to stop if they dont even want to wear a condom,1
"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?  I decided to make up names/categories because i don't know already established names for these concepts. they are defined as they come up, feel free to suggest alternative names.  If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.   However because rights are awarded to human beings which lack even basic brain functions and that it would be very difficult to define personhood in such a way to non-arbitarily include only human-beings in pre-birth periods of development as having non-person-hood then AFS might as well be considered unsound and thus inconclusive on weather fetuses have rights.    Another argument whose conclusion is the following: That all human beings which lack a brain/braintissue also lack rights (lets call it Argument from um... biology? AFB) would have nothing to say on any human beings with a brain or with any brain tissue. AFB would be sound from my first analysis of it. . another argument stating that there is a certain amount of brain development required would have something to say on all human beings which do not reach the period of development(Lets call this argument the up-till-a-point argument or UPA).  your #2 is a very good insight for It would be very beneficial to distinguish between parts of the brain which give rise to consciousness, awareness, etc(C-functions) and which just simply pump the heart, work the lungs, etc(H-functions). If it can be shown that H-functions are the only functions present till a certain point then that point would be a very good point to use for the UPA argument.   all three of the above arguments come in the form of Barbara.( I forgot to put a 'a' in-between the 'b' and 'r' in my last post.) thus if someone disagreed with them they would have to attack their premises.   I like how you pick your sources, very good.  I like number 3. I think science needs to be used more in legal matters. It too often seems like politicians yelling at each other and not backing themselves up by empirical methods.  a sort summery of my criticism on the AFS is that some brain functions, like awareness disappear nightly. sleeping would constitute aberrant behavior of awareness; however it reappears when one awakes. If a certain level of awareness must be demonstrated for a human being to be a person then person-hood is lost nightly along with rights since AFS considers them dependent on person-hood.This is not the case in actuality, people maintain rights despite sleeping. If awareness must be within a statistical likelihood of occurring within a certain amount of time, aka capable; then those constraints would be arbitrary and why they are chosen would need to be shown superior to other constraints like a longer period of time(9 months) or such in order to be more acceptable then a similar argument with different constants(a fetus being a hypothetical person and thus deserving of rights for example, similar because a sleeping human-being would also constitute a hypothetical person) . awareness also seems like one of those things which would have to be included in person-hood, in order for it to have much value.",1
"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery. It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)  Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small. Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people. A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences. There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body. You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions. Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established. A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.   Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).   Morality only applies to the parent when there is an abortion because the fetus is not yet a person - moral actions are between people and about the responsibility to actual people. Fetuses have not met the necessary requirement. This has to do with intrinsic vs extrinsic value - the fetus has no intrinsic value (no value from within).  The fathers rights are always categorically less than the mothers. he can express a claim but this claim can be superceeded by the mother.",0

"Help me with something here, are you saying that a career and education are more important than the life of a child?   Also, were you ever a zygote that had no conscious though? Than you would have to agree that if your mother had an abortion it would've killed you, not something else, but you. Aren't you glad your mother put your life before hers?",0
"When does life start? That is the question. This debate will be over in a matter of minutes if someone came up with the answer right now.  Evangelists would believe it starts at contraception while scientists debate that it is more accurately the development of the brain which is the seventh week of development.   Of course any right minded person wouldn't put the science of birth in the hands of someone with no scientific expertise so it is generally accepted that the 7th is the week that a clump of cells turn into human.  However how can any scientist or evangelist understand when a child gains a soul as the question is purely philosophical?  The soul has been deemed integral or essential to consciousness, personality and every free thinking person has a soul which defines his existence as a human being rather than an imamate object.   Plato says that a soul is a combination of various aspects. Mind, reason, emotion, appetite and desire. These characteristics define a soul. According to Platoan philosophy, if you were void of one of these aspects you are without soul.  -An unborn child has a mind which allows it to make functional processes in its body but is not capable of and thought. Thought encompasses things such as imagination, ideas and reflection. A lot of people say dreams are proof of an unborn child’s thought but dreams don’t count because they are instinctive of a human slumber. It forces the brain to stay asleep as an inactive brain causes your brain to disable processing information from nervous system and other systems. This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up, it’s like a screensaver.   -An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity. (For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion)  -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive, I suppose it counts.  -Unborn children have no desire. They do not want anything but their instinct to, live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then. There is no aspiration or defining motive.   If anyone has any counters against these points I would like to hear what you have to say. However I do believe this is an erudite explanation of the creation of ones consciousness from a philosophical standpoint. When an unborn child gains all these aspects it moves from inanimate object to living, breathing, free-thinking human being.   Ty.",1
I am really against abortion. I know that most of the abortions are cause by the teens because they arent prepared to raise a child. First of all i dont think thats a good reason to kill a baby. There are always other options not just that. I come from a family of 10 people and my mom raised us all by her self aborting never crossed her head. So what im basecly trying to say is that aborting is not a way to solve things so i think it should just be illegal.,0
Well yeah you are right but read up on the case which The U.S Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception. I think that is wrong in the whole to take a life. How many of us would even be here today if our parents had chosen abortion for us regardless of poverty or unpreparedness.,0
The women shouldn't be having unprotected sex in the first place.  Rape is an entirely different subject.,0
"Though i don't think i would be able to get an abortion because i hate big medical procedures i don't see why other people shouldn't or can't. There is not a limit on how many children a women can have, meaning if a women gets an abortion that is not one less child she can have on the future. Most only want 2 or 3 she can still have those 2 or 3 children. At the stage of pregnancy when abortions happen the baby obviously wouldnt be able to live if it was taken out of the womb that early, so is it really considered alive in the womb even if it has a heartbeat. It isn't until the 6th or 7th month that baby might have a chance of surviving if it is taken out early. People say that if it was a mistake you should have been more careful and should deal with it. But if there is a way to fix it it why is it bad? Abortion is in no way an easy route there are consequences and it is punishment enough for a mistake. And if the baby was formed without the mothers consent she whould be able to get rid of it as to not be reminded of the forced father.",1

Where did you get the 15% stat? Could you post your source? Or did you just yank that from somewhere else...I won't mention.  The reason people don't talk about it that much is because of the nature of the subject. But politicians and womans groups....talk about and are very vocal about it.,0

"I see every reason why a pro-lifer is a pro-lifer. However, I do believe it should be the woman's choice since the fetus is not born yet.

"A human life is not something to ditch.   That's why we advocate abortion. There are enough orphans in the world who will never have a whole, loving family.   Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   Did you read another post I made on this debate?   Hosea 13:15-16  “I will have no compassion,  even though he thrives among his brothers.  An east wind from the Lord will come,  blowing in from the desert;  his spring will fail  and his well dry up.  His storehouse will be plundered  of all its treasures.  The people of Samaria must bear their guilt,  because they have rebelled against their God.  They will fall by the sword;  their little ones will be dashed to the ground,  their pregnant women ripped open.”  1 Samuel 15:1-3  Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”  Deuteronomy 21:18-21  If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   They are not children. Words have a distinct meaning. Children are born, and have minds of their own. A foetus has no mind. It is incomplete, unaware. I think that you need to come to terms with your nature, that like all life we are mechanisms which are built in stages. A foetus is a stage of human without a mind, or awareness of itself. Killing it is like killing a doll.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   That's what orphans are for.   When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   A foetus isn't a child. A foetus cannot be murdered.

Thank you very much for that point you made.   I was also born out of child pregnancy and poverty. Today i am a student in pre law with a G.P.A of 4.0 and also a straight A student. Should i have been aborted i would have been robbed of my life and accomplishments.,1

But if it's just some teen who got screwed over (No pun intended (Just kidding.

"It's easy to manage that by introducing a time delay so the law will take effect 24 months from its introduction.

After that you still have a 3-month buffer if you're not yet aware of the new law, the remaining 9 months is so that people who became pregnant during this campaign period is not disadvantaged if they're still not yet aware of the new law. All this can be left to the trusty government bureaucratic systems to hash out, that's their job, and they're good at it :)",1
"To be honest, yes it is in some way ""murder,"" but what is the other solution?

Tell me honestly if you got an wanted child you would keep it because you think it is ""murder"". most people abort because they don't have the money to support that unborn child. What is better? Letting the child into a world of sh*t or spare it of what could have come. Why would you take the risk? Because if you do take the risk then and it turns out bad then it wouldn't only hurt the child's life, but yours too, and you families lives/economy.

"What is false about anything I have posted concerning abortion?   This issue is a piece of cake. Let science and medicine speak the truth. The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive. Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   ""In the third month, your baby is the size of a small apple and is fully formed. She has grown from 1 to 3 inches and weighs about 1 ½ ounces by month end. Her head now sits on her neck and you can even see the whorl of a hair pattern on the top of her head. Her head is still very large and makes up half the length of her body. Her eyes are moving closer together and her ears are continuing to form. She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex. She is beginning to practice her swallowing too. Teeth buds have also begun to form, as well as fingernails and toenails. Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily. Your placenta has now developed and has taken over hormone production.""  Most abortions happen around this gestational age. Wow a lot happening eh? It is not just a glob of tissue.   THIS IS FACT. Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it. However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.",0

No, but an acorn is the nut of an oak tree, and a chicken egg is the egg of a chicken, it would be a scientific anomaly if they were to grow into anything else. Are you denying that we are referring to a human fetus? what did you think this debate was about?  Regardless, we’re not talking about an acorn or egg, both of those have all the necessary parts to develop into their adult counterparts on their own, save for proper sunlight and water for the seed or warmth for the egg. A human fetus requires another life to create it and then sustain it until well into adolescence. Whether it is a nine week old fetus or a nine day old newborn baby, it requires another life form. This should be considered  before  people decide to just skip out on the birth control and take the risk of having an unwanted pregnancy.   Personally I don't give a fuck if people get abortions, I doesn't affect me in the least so why should I care? Living things die every day; death is just a part of life. What I  do  care about are people taking responsibility for their actions. If you don't want a baby, no duh, don't get pregnant. If you take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy and get pregnant anyway or if, god forbid, you were to get raped, then by all means, have an abortion if that’s what you want.

Not much difference between it and a tapeworm. Would you get rid of a tapeworm?  Perhaps you would keep the unborn child because you want to give birth to it and love it later in life, but then this is just a matter of YOUR personal preference and should ONLY be considered in the matter of your own child.

"Many proponents of abortion say that it is up to the mother to decide what happens to her body. However, they seem to be forgetting one key matter: does the baby not have a choice as to it's body? Some say that cancer is alive and that by killing it we are ending a life. However, cancer will never gain sentience; cancer will never learn; cancer will never go to school. Cancer is like a parasite, feeding off of the body and expanding until the body is dead.   I am completely for the use of the term 'fetus.' The excuse for the abortion is that the baby is not yet a baby, rather only a fetus. That is where they are wrong. A fetus is just as much a human as I am, it simply has not progressed to the point in life I which I have reached.

If a mother is definitely going to die very slowly and painfully if the baby is not aborted, is it more immoral to abort the baby or allow the mother to die a slow and agonising death?  Let me raise another scenario. What if a minor was impregnated by a violent rape and the rapist does not take responsibility for the child? Is it more immoral to leave a defenceless and helpless minor to care for a baby, a constant psychological reminder of rape, or for her to abort? I'm not talking about who you would have more sympathy for, but merely on what moral grounds do you have to say abortion is immoral.  By logic, you yourself have no good reason to be opposed to abortion.",1
"Abortion is murder! you are killing a human being inside! The baby has already satarted developing and is most certainle wrong! Is killing someone really worth a bad reputaion, being fat, having to take on a new responsibility, or having to go through the pain of birth?!!!!! NO!!!!!",0
"As I have already mentioned, several times, other choices are avaliable, and yet, many couples/individuals choose to ignore these choices. What I suggest is that protective sex must come into play, this way, we can completely forget about the possibility of an abortion.  The only exception that I could possibly see to this is with the case of rape, and this is only covers 1% of all abortions.  If abortions are outlawed, the world may finally smarten up when it comes to sex and childbirth, and then, just maybe, we can start worrying more about the future of the child rather than the beginning.",0
A. there is no reason to bring personal things into a debate   B. My parents intended to have a child. Planned pregnancies are different from impregnation via traumatic experiences.,1
"1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   You have made no argument to oppose abortion here. You have simply asserted without evidence that abortion is ""wrong"". Whether or not the rapist is caught has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not.   What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have?   It seems to me that the scenario he/she gave was very specific and we do know that the baby would have a bad quality of life at birth, making the chances of survival and access to opportunities very slim. Thus, you have no reason to play the sceptic card here.   Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   This is a red herring.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things.   Really? This is a hasty generalisation on your part. You have again asserted without evidence.   How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted   Mentally challenged people cannot be aborted because they have already been born.   My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives.   Another appeal to emotion.   Let me ask you this. Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   Another red herring.",1
"Technically speaking, a fetus is not a human yet. Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom. No baby is made, yet intercourse still happens.",1
Yes it should be banned. People shouldn't be having sex if they don't wanna a baby. Or it should be protected. Killing babies is a crime.,0
"You said, “Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.”  It takes two, the woman can’t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married…does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they take…then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, “Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.”  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesn’t want to be involved. Example…..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trial…..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She did…because whether reckless sex happened or not…the risk she took didn’t pan out….she got pregnant….and where is the dad???????  You said, “If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?”  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, “Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?”   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings “  You also said, “You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.”  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a sty………LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignorance…go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take it…roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like it’s a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two. Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, “You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?”  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, “It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. “This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.”  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes off…knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman?  You said, “An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, “The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.”  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the bases…have not scored a grand slam… and she says no……..it’s no, you can’t come in. If he does against her wishes it’s rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it won’t affect him in the least…..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     “How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.”  It does take a man and a woman to procreate…which is why I also am against same sex unions, it’s not natural…but that’s another debate. They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same page….but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, “Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, “I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.”  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   “In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.”  Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….I should have known better…and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didn’t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witness…to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same page…until later…when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didn’t. Worldviews change….and mine did drastically. We have adjusted…and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, “I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?”  Distraught about what? Tell me….how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I don’t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch this……..and if you don’t, think about the reasons why you won’t. Search your heart…about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have children….put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     “I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.”  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldn’t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? It’s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, “You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, “Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.”  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  “What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.”  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t. People act out of fear….and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM…I am talking about the people in his own country….the people who could have physically taken himout….the guards, etc.   Abortion is like that….people sit by and do nothing….they think anything they do….won’t change the laws, won’t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion….if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and good…….abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortion….wow….how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheists….so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evil………..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, “Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.”  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thing……..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to none……but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, “I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.”  You condone murder….I never called you a racist.     You said, “I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?”  I never use violent adjectives on you….you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classless…  .  “I didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.”  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if you’re wrong…you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with them…..being with family etc…would be just a tad bit good…you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you can’t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not go…that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  “You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?”  It’s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heart….I can’t, scripture does not allow me to do that…not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you don’t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done that…I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in? LOL  You said, “No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.”  You don’t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, “Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.”  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep now…. I post rarely from Wikipedia….and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know….  “I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c”  This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, “What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?”  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the world……its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the law…just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Can’t let this one go……your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlier… You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.",0
I like what the Bible says. Some things in the Bible makes me sad but it is the truth so i fallow it. You are not understanding. You probably did not even read the link. You're the one who says the Bible is a lie so you need other evidence. That is what i just did and you criticize me for not going to the Bible for information.,0
what if that person was the reason y u r inside of them u make no since at all all of your disputes are opinions,0
It should be legal because it is an action on someone's body and that person has a right to do what they want with their body. Obviously the person should make an educated decision if to get an abortion or not(adoption is a viable option)but in the end it is their choice.  If the person considering abortion lives in poverty(or other adverse conditions) and does not feel or know that she can properly care for the baby once it is born and give it the foundation of a good and healthy life then an abortion should be legal so as that the suffering that the child would endure could be prevented.   Making abortion illegal denies one's freedom over one's body and no institution should be able to make such a claim or action.,1
"Yes it should be legal, within the first time frame of the pregnancy, the embryonic stage. Once the embryo first develops into a ""baby"", when it is no longer embryonic, abortion is not right. Under certain circumstances though, this condition might be avoided, like if the woman is underage, or was raped.",1
When a fetus hasnt been born yet it isnt a person to me. If somethign cannot live without something for it to hook up to for life support it isnt alive. It isnt alive until it is born. It could be way more hazardous to the mother than the child.,1
"i believe that abortion should be legal because all an abortion is, is preventing a baby from being born into the world. if thats the case, then what are we doing by using birth control or condoms. we are preventing a baby from being born into the world. its also the mother's choice, and the father if hes still around. and what about those who are raped and unfortunate with a baby of that specific person.",1
Goodbye.  And apply some energy to thinking about how to make your arguments more understandable and persuasive logically.,1
"""killing a baby is killing an innocent life. Why? well first of all, you don't give the baby a chance to live.""  If you don't give the ""baby"" a chance to live, then how can there be a life to kill?",1
"Abortion invleves killing a living human being, so it is definitely wrong. But I don't think the penal law is the most efficient way to keep the number of abortions down. We should do more to help young and/or poor women and girls whon get pregnant instead. Welfare queens are a lesser evil than killing innocent human beings.",0
"You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.   I have never made this claim. You are putting words in my mouth.   You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.   That is because I don't think abortion is wrong  in every circumstance . I think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and/or under the wrong medical circumstances, making  some  abortion cases morally wrong.   I give it personhood   But the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly. If you want to argue on the basis of personhood, then a baby within the first trimester doesn't even have a brain to speak of. It, therefore, doesn't have the ability to  feel , let alone reason, within the first trimester.   War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   You are comparing the two wrongly. War is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself. Even if I were to accept that the unborn baby is a person (which is a view that I do not  necessarily  agree with, as I've explained above), then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life-threatening illness!   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL   I'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour. That just goes to show how frivolous you are. What a hypocrite. And, by the way, I don't think  human  life is sacred and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. If you think that life is sacred, then you, by logical deduction, should not be able to eat anything that has life (i.e. animals and even vegetables and fruits).   Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…   You are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through  during  the nine ""short"" months. Furthermore, you said ""allow something to live"", right? If the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother, then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the MOTHER to live. If you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby, are you doing what is ""right""?   AFter conception it is a separate human being   It is not. As I have explained, the baby is not a human being within the first trimester. Furthermore, the unborn baby, no matter at any stage, is dependent on it's mother  completely  for nutrition. In other words, the baby is, technically speaking, a  parasite . The Oxford English Dictionary defines a ""parasite"" as ""Biol. An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and draws its nutriment directly from it. Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" Thus, by definition, the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body  AT THE EXPENSE OF HER OWN HEALTH .   How barbaric and cold is that?   Which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not. Or whether it should be legal or not. This is simply an appeal to emotion.   It should not matter whether the child will make it or not.   Then, whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you. Pro-choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision. They do NOT promote abortion, simply the  legalisation  of abortion. If you can't see the difference, then you're an idiot.   Abortion is premeditated killing.   And so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live. If the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, by not aborting the child, you are also premeditating the killing of the mother. Thus, by your standards, you face a paradox. I am appalled by how people can call themselves ""pro-life"" when they say that the mother's life doesn't matter as long as the baby is not aborted. This is hypocrisy of the greatest degree.   Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….   I am not a ""pro-abort"". I am pro-choice, as I have explained the difference.   So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery. Thus, you are attacking a straw man. Poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been ""allowed to survive"" face.   You said this….""Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy  and self-consciousness.""  Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.   Of course it does. It has autonomy and self-consciousness. But then again, even if I agree with you, by saying that a newborn baby can't have such experiences, it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral. Thus, your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer is ""no"". Congratulations, you have proven that you at least have  some  level of intelligence.",1
"And how would the fetus be poisoned? You mean the mother did drugs or something?  And the pregnancy you said could go wrong? How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.  You say abortion should be stopped? How? And what reasons is ok to kill?  Why are abortions important? To the unborn killed? Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?  The solution for woman today....is abortion which most use as one method of birth control. Most women do not have just one abortion...but two and three. So they are killing multiple times. The humanity I am fighting for are the 99% of unborns killed for social reasons.",0

"Personally, I am in the middle. In cases where either a) upon being born, the fetus will have died or killed the mother or b) when the person became pregnant as a result of rape or sexual assault, abortion is OK. However, people who get pregnant as a result of pure stupidity (not using protection, for example) should not be permitted to abort.",0
"For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?  The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?",0
"if abortion was illegal it would still occur. it would be dangerous to the mother as well. it was legallised in england out of pity for the women who felt they had to resort to it, to protect their well being and the rest. it should stay legal, it will always be something that happens. some women perform self abortions with metal clothing hangers and end up dead. if abortion was not possible at all meaning whether illegal or not just not physically possible then i bet a lot of the women who desperately need them would kill themselves.",1
"In no situation, aside from health problems leading to the death of the mother and child, should abortion ever become an option. If you are not ready to be a mother, you didn't plan for it, etc., it's still not an option. Would you go out and murder someone walking down the street? So why would you ever kill an innocent, unborn human? Especially one that is half of you? Even if rape is involved, would you murder an innocent neighbor child because you were raped? Think of how your life would be different if even one person you know had never existed: multiply that by hundreds of thousands. More people have been killed by abortions (in the US only) in the past six years than Jews died in the Holocaust (there are app. 1.37 mil each year). By this time tomorrow, app. 3,700 more babies will be dead. I truly am sorry if it was a mistake, if the mother's not ready, even if there was rape involved. But that is still no reason to take a human life! I am fourteen (yes, fourteen), and I would not do it! Never would it even cross my mind! Only God can create life; only He should take it away. You wouldn't kill your family, you wouldn't kill a friend, you wouldnt kill a child (or anyone!) on the street, why in the Hell (literally!!!) would you kill an innocent baby, especially your own?  by the way, the statistics in this argument are taken from &gt;http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/                                        fastfacts.html&lt;.",0

"The error in the syllogism is the distribution of the middle term. And had I distributed the middle term to read:  “Taking an aspirin terminates any biological process.”, it would be valid.

I tried to point that out with three obviously wrong syllogisms.   Did you assume I am one of the run-of-the-mill participants at CD?  If so, I understand the assumption.    I assumed that your reasoning capabilities were faulty.   Now, having gone through the trial of assessing your comprehension of refutation, twice no doubt, I am left wondering why “taking an aspirin” has any relevance to the abortion of a pregnancy and its attributes.   You responded to my argument that abortion isn't taking a life, as a foetus doesn't qualify. You asked if an abortion ends a biological process, presumably because life is a biological process. I replied that aspirin ends a biological process, implying that a biological process is just another name for metabolism, or biological pathways.  In other words, abortion ends a biological process, but life isn't the only biological process.",1

How long have humans existed? It's only in the last 100 years that medicine has been greatly involved in child birth. Of course babies survive without medical intervention. It's natural to not have someone constantly shoving there fingers in you to check dilation. It's natural to give birth unaided. More and more woman now, even in developed countries are choosing not to have a child in hospital or with medical assistance. Instead they opt to give birth at home naturally and without medical intervention. People in poor countries just give birth in their bed and get on with it!    and want them dead.

You want abortion legal…on demand period.   The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Now I know what our laws say…that killing should be an option for women. But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission? The unborn can't speak for themselves.   It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn. It is killing by burning, scrapping, dismembering, vacuuming the child until its dead. That is every abortionists goal. The unborn has to be killed in the womb….not outside. This picture is accurate and shows abortion. Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic….it puts action to reality…it gives a face to what they condone. And what they condone is barbaric.  This is a surgery or procedure that is like none else on earth. Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.",0
"It is a choice. And when abortion was illegal the majority of women had their babies. Less women got pregnant because they knew that abortion was really not an option…it was hard to find illegal abortion clinics and doctors that would perform them.

You either want abortions legal…or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal. One thing your not…Pro-life…not if you want abortion legal. Thats like child abuse. Looking away you know its wrong but its your neighbors right to do it. Do you help the children no.   Now rape is a serious violent act and it is wrong. But that which is created is still a child, innocent at that. It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act…and abortion is the next. The mother chooses to violently end her childs life.   I have known people who have used birth control but still got pregnant. Accidents happen…but, you still are taking the risk…because no birth control is 100% effective…..unless you get fixed. We live in a sexually active society. If more women are keeping their babies because they are not looked down on by society anymore. More couples live together today than get married. TV, radio, magazines, movies…..in general foster the idea that if it feels good it can't be that bad. We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant. Kids know about sex earlier than ever today. So I highly doubt that if women have sex they don't know what can happen. Accidents happen…and women know that.   It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for. So you help to paint a bullseye on every child who is conceived in its mothers womb.",1
"A fetus is not just a bunch of extra cells, you moron.......",0
"Um, that doesnt prove anything except what it actually is. When a woman becomes pregnant she starts going through a hormonal change to adjust for this really huge thing that is about to happen to her life. It is natures way of preparing a woman for motherhood. When the baby is lost, through abortion, miscarriage, or accident, all women go back to normal hormones in a quick fashion and it causes depression.   If you think that a woman feeling guilty about the abortion isnt misplaced emotion then let me tell you a general story that I am sure relates to every woman on the planet.   When you get all emotional and upset because your bf or husband does not put the dishes in the right place or some other lame ass reason for getting upset, do you really think that that is really the issue?

"You are ignoring the fact that most abortions are for convenience, not rape or any medical need. The most common reasons women consider abortion are:  Per webmd.com ""The most common reasons women consider abortion are: 1. Birth control (contraceptive) failure. Over half of all women who have an abortion used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant.2 Inability to support or care for a child. 3. To end an unwanted pregnancy. 4. To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems. Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.5. Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. 6. Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued.  If the pro-life community were to all agree today that all rape victims should be given abortions (if desired) and then loved without reservation until they are (somewhat) whole again, the pro-abortion industry would give not one inch on their opposition to any restrictions on unlimited abortions. The 'pregnant rape victim' is a red herring, meant only to emotionalize the issue in their favor.",0
"Maybe you should check the statistics to show how many women are having repeat abortions. Do you think that the unborn should pay for the mistakes of it's mother?

Furthermore, for every mistake there is a punishment. Didn't parents punished you for a mistake, don't the laws punish you for a mistake, don't your job punish you for a mistake?Why?

"Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent? If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience. Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep?   Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.  I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.  But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.   which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience   We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.   The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?   This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.  We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.   If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it.   This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.   In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.   The laws allowing abortion do so because it suits the women. They don't parade themselves as some sort of philosophical and moral beacon. It's mostly pragmatic.",1
"It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns.   Bullshit. Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings, won't you?   But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite. According to the OED, the scientific definition of a parasite is ""An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and  draws its nutriment directly from it . Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" (Emphasis my own)  All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her. Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply  dis allowing the fetus to continue living within her.   No one should have the right to kill innocent people.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.",1
"The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.  I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship. Scientifically, in order for the realtionship to be considered parasitic, therehas to be the elements of parasitism to exists. Those elements are not here. Let me put it this way for you, every adult person has personhood but if the elements of personhood are absent, it means that person does not have personhood at all even though some might consider him or her as having personhood. Again, i dont need to hear your opinions. If you want to prove your point, then produce evidence and i will believe you.  So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life. Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.  But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.  So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.  NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.",0
"Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life. When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked."" Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib? Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds. Even if you don't believe abortion is murder, it still demeans the value of human life, since women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.  Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control. There are dozens of birth control methods that can keep you from becoming pregnant, including the 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.  The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out. What would the world be like if the mothers of Abe Lincoln, George Washington, or Thomas Edison had had an abortion? Just maybe a woman has become pregnant despite all birth control attempts because the child is destined to do something great.  Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child. Many women who have abortion in their younger years end up living the rest of their lives in perpetual guilt. Even if that women doesn't consider it murder at the time, that may change as she matures. Even Jane Roe (not her real name), the original woman behind the famous court decision, has completely changed her mind on abortion. She filed a petition to have the decision overturned to help relieve the guilt of hundreds of thousands of needless deaths she blames on herself. Also, let's not forget that there are two parents of every aborted child. The father may feel just as guilty. The father may even want the child, but he has no choice if the mother chooses abortion.  The advances of genetic testing may prompt more abortions (to avoid having the non-ideal child). All of us who have or want kids imagine them growing up to be doctors, senators, sports stars, or whatever. But what would you do if you knew the child would have Down's Syndrome? What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? What if the child had a strong risk of schizophrenia? Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion? As genetic knowledge continues to grow, we are able to determine more and more about what a child will be like as an adult. Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.  There are many couples who spend years on waiting lists trying to adopt a child. The number of couples out there who cannot have a child of their own for physical reasons are too numerous to count. The waiting list for adopting babies can be 5-10 years or more. Young women in their teens are right to be concerned that they're not ready to effectively raise a child. However, if that is the case, there are plenty of wonderful people out there who are. Not only would you be bringing a valuable life into the world, you'd also be making the dream of a childless couple come true.  The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults, who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions. There's a good reason why we don't allow people to drink alcohol, smoke, or drive until they're a certain age. It's because they haven't matured enough to make good, sound decisions. We've all made bad decisions in our younger years that provide us with life experience to make sounder judgment in the future. The one skill that seems to take the longest time to develop is the ability to consider the feelings and needs of someone besides ourselves. Why should such a life or death decision as abortion be made by a person who probably hasn't developed that capacity?   People have the right not to see their tax dollars go to something they find immoral. Abortion is a medical procedure that must be performed by a doctor. The government contributes to many health care institutions such as Healthcare for the Homeless, Planned Parenthood, free clinics, etc. All of us who pay taxes have the right to prevent that money from going to something we consider murder.   Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child. The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen. Just because the babies can't speak for themselves doesn't mean they have no rights. If a 1-month old is murdered, it that really different than abortion as far as protecting an American's life? If a person shoots and kills a pregnant woman, shouldn't the punishment be more severe? If you legalize abortion, it would tell the courts there is no difference.   Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility. Abortion exposes woman to a number of health risks including, but not limited to, infection, sterility, and in rare cases, death. A number of short-term symptoms such as bleeding, fever, nausea, and vomiting are also common.   Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath. Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"". It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed. Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism. Killing a human being doesn't serve any higher medical purpose and is therefore a violation of the oath.",0
"Well I'm sorry (not literally) that you feel so categorical towards the development of human life. Some of us, who actually believe in a reproduction with effort, look at a fetus AS HUMAN LIFE. While it may be a scrambled cluster of cells, it is already developing beyond the category of ""potential,"" regardless of self-awareness. Any scientist will tell you what reproduction means the world to the human race.  Maybe it's a parasite to you, but it's something completely different in the end isn't it?  Look, I don't care about all this BS with ""what is a child and what isn't,"" it isn't even the point of my argument.  My point is that a child cannot voice an opinion, and that sometimes, to prevent the worst, someone has to voice it for them. If we were all like you, saying that it should be completely up to the mother, then there'll be no need to second guess how the population will be affected.  For all you know, you could be aborting the next 'potential' President, or the next 'potential' anything! No-one can say how that'll change things, after all, the only means of comparison has just been scraped out of a woman's womb.  So Mr. Potential, have a nice day, and have a hard, long think about the 'potential life' that isn't even given the chance to survive!",0

"I am quite sick of abortion debates, so I'll write my three strongest arguments for abortion and let's see if any of you ""pro-life"" people can rebut them. While many people have formulated different arguments for abortion (some better than others), not all of them are grounded in the concept of  sentience . Unlike them, all of my three arguments do, at least, relate to the concept of sentience.   1. The Sentience Argument   1. Only a being that is conscious and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain can be said to have interests.  2. A sentient, and therefore morally significant, being is one with an interest in continued life.  3. Ergo, only a sentient being can be said to perhaps have a  right  to life. (From (2) )  4. Normal human foetus begins to possess a rudimentary capacity for sentience in the  second  trimester.  5. Ergo, an early term foetus is  NOT  a being with an interest in its own continued life. (From (3) and (4) ) (Or, Only a human foetus from the second trimester on can perhaps be said to have a right to life)  6. Ergo, an early term human foetus (i.e. foetus in the first trimester) does  not  have a right to life (from (5) )  7. Ergo, an early term abortion is morally permissible (from (6) ).   2. The Utilitarian Argument   1. Different sentient beings experience differing degrees or intensities of experiences such as suffering.  2. The prospect of death and dying is a more intense experience for a sentient being that possesses capabilities such as foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  3. Ergo, the principle of respect for the interests of sentient beings does not imply that all sentient beings have an equal right to life. (from (1) and (2) )  4. A foetus, sentient or otherwise, does not possess foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  5. Ergo, a sentient foetus may be accorded lesser moral significance than the sentient adult human being in whose body it gestates. (from (3) and (4) )  6. Ergo, the suffering experienced by a sentient late term foetus terminated through abortion, would be less than the suffering experienced by the pregnant woman, a sentient being, were she forced to continue with the pregnancy. (from (1), (2) and (4) )  7. Ergo, a sentient pregnant woman has a greater right to life than a (sentient) foetus. (from (3) and (6) )  8. Ergo, a late term abortion is morally permissible (from (7) )   3. The Personhood Argument   1. Personhood is defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.  2. It is more seriously morally impermissible to kill a person than a non-person, even a sentient non-person.  3. An early-stage foetus possesses little, if anything, in the way of consciousness, self-conceptualisation, reasoning and communication abilities.  4. Ergo, focuses are not persons (from (1) and (3) )  5. Ergo, foetuses cannot possess interests or rights, including the right to life (from (4) )  6. Ergo, it is not morally impermissible to kill them (from (5) ).  You might have noticed that in all three of my arguments, my conclusions are not necessarily the same. I am  not  advocating for a convergence in conclusion when I posit these arguments. I am merely stating three (quite) good arguments for abortion.",1
"Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged. And I will wear that label with honor.  But tell me why you think no one likes getting an abortion, and why everyone would be happier if there were less abortions.     And about that ""clump of cells"" are they cancer cells? if not, what kind of cells are they?  Finally,   In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.   True, however life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guarantied to all of them expect those in the early stages of development, those in their mothers womb. That's discrimination based on level of development and that's just plain wrong. The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb",0
"Why do we need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it? It's our fetus, not yours, we can get rid of this one and then we can make another one! Women have children after abortions all the time, it's when they're ready to be mothers!  It's not a person before it can survive outside the womb, so if you think it is a person good for you! Don't force us to see your point of view as we don't force you to see ours.",1
"And is abortion for social reasons ok?   I'll repeat it again. No. They are not okay.    You said they are wrong....  WHEN?   You make out one night and then get pregnant and then you do an abortion. That is wrong.  You kill a baby cuz your unhappy with it's sex kind.  You kill a baby cuz you are not ready for one.  You kill a baby cuz you were raped and that baby is unwanted. I'm sure you don't reckon or enjoy it's birth. But, that gives no one a right to kill a baby.  I believe that abortions are a strict no until really required.  If the mom is incapable of the birth process or is too weak or may communicate a murderous disease or until your life is at the stake.  I'm glad that you are fighting for the right of the 99% of the unborn. I appreciate the fact that there a certain few who are involved. You fight for those who are killed for social reasons. But, I'm trying to explain that there is no need to be so cross about this process. At a level, the strictness must be loosened and all the guilt saved. There must be exceptions. Valid exceptions.",1
"It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally.   You are attacking a straw man. I did not say that having a baby was an accident. I was saying that the failure of contraception was an accident. The failure of contraception might not lead to pregnancy, no matter how high the probability. If you were to argue this point, you would be going down a very slippery slope. Furthermore, an appeal to nature is hardly a cogent argument.   The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring.   I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Nope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   And none of which are usually fatal.   You are attacking another straw man argument. I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong. The point is that if an organism lacks rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciousness, it is no more than a mechanical machine that can be terminated without such an act being considered morally wrong.   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   Did I even make that point?   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.   Right. This is purely an assertion without justification.",1
"""It is the taking of a human life however you try to spin it.""   Aborting an embryo is not taking a human life because an embryo is not yet a human, it's just a clump of cells with the potential to become a human.",0
"why shouldn't it matter?   It isn't a life yet. You are a life, I am a life. We have memories, minds, identities. A foetus has none of this, it is alive without being a proper life.  That is why there is no problem with it.   Doesn't everything deserve a chance?   Rationally speaking, no. Life has limited resources, and one of those resources is family. Only so many loving, positive families exist, and abortion prevents a a child from being raised as a burden. Why would you want a child to be raised in a family that was unprepared? Why should a child exist in a loveless or incompetent family? Why should a child become an orphan? Children need deep emotional bonds to become good people. You are supporting a belief that causes inconvenient children to roam the world, growing up into social problems and criminal elements.   The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it.    That's because a foetus isn't self-aware. It's a protohuman, it may be alive but it isn't aware of itself.   That's not fair to just say ""I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it.""    I believe the abortion issue of today evolved with the far right's displeasure of reduced gender roles brought on by feminism. Abortion is the ultimate sign of a woman's ownership of her body. Something that was traditionally left up to chance is now within her control, and a man can no longer force her to become a mother who stays at home, giving up her dreams. It is her choice now, too. I think that abortion is one of those emotional issues which everyone has a feeling about, but as a matter of private thought, yet politicians capitalised upon it as a means of dividing people and pulling them to support a movement they might otherwise ignore.   In other words, abortion like pregnancy is a private issue that is frankly none of our business when it concerns someone else. The reason we keep it legal is so that a woman may choose to exercise control over her body should the need arise.",1
"That's right!  It's a personal choice until the fetus can survive outside the mother's womb. This is around 20 weeks into the pregnancy. After that, society can decide what to do with it because they can theoretically intervene and keep it alive without the mother. Society wants to make laws, it should stick to areas that it could actually control.",1

"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.   Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?   If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.   You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned",1
"Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing   Never said it was, only the logic behind it. Here is an example:   It is the mother's property   FYI that's the same logic that was used to justify the beating of slaves; it was the slave master's property.   You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself.     That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency. Should I discriminate against you because you are dependent on the local grocery store to get your milk? I think not, that would be wrong.  And finally, did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.",1
"What an ignorant thought. Of course you would have existed. While you obviously wouldn't realize what was happening,   If I had no awareness of my existence before it was terminated, then it is not really a factor to me.    it is still a horrible violation of human rights.    Looks like you got a little mixed up. Not forcing a woman to incubate a fetus she doesn't want is a  preservation  of a human right; the right to bodily autonomy.   Studies have shown again and again that when aborted, the baby is not just a lifeless blob of tissue, it is A LIVING BEING. You jusyt won't accept the evidence. I don't what else must happen to rid you of your foolish thoughts.   Nobody is arguing that a fetus is a lifeless blob of tissue. What they are arguing is that it does not deserve all the rights of a conscious and/or independent human being, especially when granting them such rights would override the rights of an  actual  person - the mother.",1

"//Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.//  Yes, sex is a form of procreation; however, there are points that suggest that sex in humans are not just for procreation. If sex was entirely for procreation, 1) pregnancy would be a direct result every time; 2) we would ""know"" when a woman is in estrus and engage in sexual activity during this time only; and 3) fertilisation of a human egg is possible without sexual activity due to the invention of IVF.  //If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.//  Intelligence has nothing to do with having sex or not. It is natural to have sexual desire and in my opinion, it is stupid to avoid sex when it has many other factors than for ""making babies"". Women are not broodmares.  //What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her?//  Firstly, what child is involved when a woman is considering abortion during her pregnancy? If you are the ""genius"" why do you fail to grasp that ""child"" is the developmental stage from birth to adult?   //Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?//  If you want to take this stance then it begs the question: How do you know it has it's own ""life"" when biologically, it is not viable?

But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   Irrelevant. They knew it is possible and they are at fault for ignoring all the possibilities.   ope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   Well then How does human not equal homo sapien?   I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong.    Exactly. I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.",0

How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion?   Exactly what did I write that gave you the idea I'm ""pro-abortion""? Do you think I want to make abortions mandatory or something? I'm not pro abortion or anti abortion, there are cases where abortion is a good choice, and cases where it is a bad choice; but regardless of the case, it's not our choice. It's hers.   If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose?   If there were two teams, one was pro-rape and the other was pro-arson, which one would you choose? -_-   Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose?   Neither.   Huh... I guess I could say neither, couldn't I. ;)  It's almost as though I have... a choice. o.O   When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please.   When did I say pro-choice was NOT referring to a woman's right to have an abortion? What are you even talking about?

You've been acting like an idiot since the beginning AND you've been acting like an idiot towards others. Or are they all ""low graded"" as well? But even if what you say is true, you'd still be an idiot because that is the only kind of person that would purposefully debate poorly to ""match"" his opponents wit.   Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less.   What means less? You haven't connected this sentence to anything so I have no idea what you're talking about.   You seem to forget that you are debunking without facts so if i am liar good for me.   I'm not using facts... so it's good that you're a liar? You make less and less sense every post.   You seem to think facts are some holy grail and whomever has the most of them ""wins"" or something. Let me tell you, in matters of philosophy logic trumps facts. you can string together miles of facts, if the logic doesn't follow then you're wrong.   Again i will not have you calling me names and if you do not stop then i will restrain you from posting any arguments in relation to my debates because name calling is childishness to me and the same goes for comparing.   I repress nothing about myself. If I feel like calling you an idiot then I will and if you aren't mature enough to handle such criticism then perhaps your better off banning me.  It would only show your insecurities.   I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent.   Once again, you're projecting. If ""judging"" is a ban-able offense in your books then you should of banned yourself a hundred times over.   Let us keep it to a professional level please.   I agree, lets keep it professional. I'll stop calling you names and you stop:  Straw-man-ing  Lying  Red-herring....ing  Appealing to authority  Appealing to emotion  And going off topic  I think this sound more than fair.   My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts?   Yeas, I have you an example where I used a fact. What, you want me to re-type EVERYTHING I've written out thus far and highlight everything that qualifies as a fact???  Look, I've debunked you're conclusions. Now you either concede or go about un-debunking me. THAT'S how a debate works. It's not about who has the most facts, it's about who's position makes the most sense.   Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion.   Inconsistent with what? Do you even know what the word inconsistent means? (rhetorical)  Everything you've said so far has been one of the things I asked you to stop doing earlier in this post. They are all fallacies, so yes, your entire argument is based on fallacy. You've even admitted that your arguments are based on appeals to emotion/authority, so I'm not sure exactly what you're complaining about here...

"Abortion before the fetus can actually survive outside of the mother's womb is not the same as killing Jews or mentally or physically sick people.

"You keep making counter-arguments based on examples outside of what I am referring to. I am not talking about any zygote. We could argue in circles all year with various banter to this degree.  I am referring to the specific zygote that results from the fertilization event after intercourse, between two human beings.   So artificially inseminated women can get abortions and clones can be aborted now. Where's your irrational bleeding heart now?   I'm not talking about an animal or genetically engineered cells or whatever crazy outlandish example that you keep pulling out of your arse.   This isn't 1950, and medical science isn't like the old Frankenstein movies of the old days. Mammalian cloning has been done many times in the past, and cell biology is a maturing science that allows the techniques I disclosed as a matter of common practice. Human cloning isn't special, it's just presently illegal.   Correction: fully grown humans are defined by that. Those humans had to go through a growing stage before they gained all of the abilities that you mentioned. During that growth, they are not fully grown but are still human life.   Again wrong. Babies and toddlers have a very simple capacity to reason, think and grow. This is afterall why they can learn language and our culture.   I am not concerned with it because the premise of my argument is indifferent with relation to the law. I am strictly dealing with morality. It use to be legal to own people. Thank goodness people didn't take the position that you are taking.   Oh yes, I remember slavery. Back in those days the Negroes were considered inferior creations, descended from god's disfavoured, cast-away people. It was thought that our moral duty was to own them because we could elevate them from their primitive culture and bring them some form of civilisation. To do otherwise, to let them have ownership of their own bodies was considered the same as allowing them to return to laziness and unproductivity.  Just another one of history's great examples of what happens when morals are imposed upon people without their consent for their greater good.   You still have failed to disprove what I said. We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware. The exact moment of self-awareness is extremely important if you want to prove your argument, but you simply cannot do so. You wrote a check that your mind couldn't cash.   I thought it was obvious, but I'll try again since you seem to need help here:  At what point does a fetus respond to stimuli? At what point toes it show signs of memory? At what point does it have a central nervous system? Answer all three questions and you have a reasonable cut-off period for abortions, or at least a decent argument for one.   Sure it matters. One method is natural and another method is unnatural. I don't advocate human cloning either, even though that could result in more human life.   I'll repeat myself: unnatural versus natural means squat. Find a logical distinction, and don't rely purely on what feels good.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy   Your argument to my point that all cells have the potential for life as a fetus does, is something like ""but it's not natural!!!""   http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html  (checkmate)  I never said anything about the zygote having a soul. My position is that it is human life, therefore to end that life at any point should be considered murder.    You might want to do more research.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction    http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/                                      3500603.html     http://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm    In other words, PBA (Intact dilation and extraction) accounts for under 1% of abortions as of 2000, and about 5% as of 2003.  In other words your argument that babies' brains are being sucked out is a peripheral one that does not cover the main issue: the vast majority of abortions don't abort fetuses with brains, but instead embryos.   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png     I'm not concerned with you bizarre hypothetical that completely ignores that basis of which we have been debating on. At no point did I say sperm or a woman's eggs were human life. The conjoining of the 2 in a fertilization event which results in a zygote is human life. (Naturally through intercourse)   Your argument that embryos and fetuses are human lives is as absurd as my ""bizarre hypothetical"" and what's more your position is backed almost exclusively by religious agenda and not reason, again like my ""bizarre example.""  I have a question for you: if you care so deeply about embryos and young fetuses being aborted (the vast majority of abortions fall under this, after all) why aren't you setting up adoption centres that give money to couples who choose to have the child instead of abort it? Why aren't you donating time and effort to foster services? Why aren't you looking for research teams, or developing research teams to find ways to emulate a uterus for incubating embryos?  In other words at the moment you're just being an opinionated jackoff who isn't DOING anything to help the situation. You have a feeling, an opinion that somehow an embryo deserves equal rights as a human being, but you're not showing an inkling of care for the women that must suffer if your opinion had any weight.   And I ridicule you and everyone who thinks like you do. You inject new, fabricated, unrealistic hypotheticals into the debate and expect it to make sense. You can try to justify abortion all you want by bringing animals and artificial matters into the discussion but it is painfully obvious that you are searching frantically for an excuse to allow the taking of innocent human life.   I expect it to make sense because I figured that you had the intelligence to imagine your argument taken to its logical extremes. I don't have to wring my hands and sweat over the treatment of fetuses, zygotes and embryos as less than human because I genuinely do not feel anything towards them. Your attempts to elicit emotion by conflating fetuses with infants also does nothing to me because I feel no emotion towards them either. We may as well be discussing the building of a fence.",1

"Pro-choice is full of idiocy because unlimited rights in every situation is, of course, ridiculous. You're right, you're supposed to be able to be punished for your actions if you do something stupid. To have the rights to avoid responsibility for every last mistake you make is an abandonment of logic.  Pro-life is full of idiocy because most of the time it is based on the notion that the second a sperm and egg meet and become a single complete cell, they become a human being with all of the same rights of a human being. That is an abandonment of logic.  Logical, truly moral balance is found on middle ground between the two extremes.",1
What else can I get you? A supporting comment.  Perhaps this is not the place to continue this discussion.,0
"All of us were once a fetus.    Agree.   That is a child.   Disagree: unsupported leap in logic. The organism passes through varied stages of development between ""fertilized egg"" and ""child.""   Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video   Incorrect assertion. Watched it, multiple times, not in favor of outlawing abortion.   We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right.   Yup, that's your right, but since SCOTUS has already rejected ""it's a person it's a child"" not just once but many times, continuing to just assert ""it's a person it's a child"" while citing to a video from 25 years ago is probably not a very strong argument with which to challenge the law.",1
"Taxpayer dollars are used to enable poor women to access the same medical services as rich women, and abortion is one of these services. Funding abortion is no different from funding a war in the Mideast. For those who are opposed, the place to express outrage is in the voting booth.",1
"If you admit that abortion is EVER warranted. Then it doesn't make sense to make it illegal.  I think a good angle for reducing unnecessary abortions, could be to legislate the rights the father obtains during the act of consensual sex.",1
I've never met anyone who is PRO-abortion. No one is pro-abortion. Some people just respect others' right to have an abortion. I highly doubt that even those who get abortions actively promote them.,0
"How can we differ ourselves from murderer if we ourselves are cold-hearted enough to kill an innocent child...one who has not even get the chance to see the world? Mothers should have the love for children...and when you had a child whether born or not, it is your responsibility to raise them up, to guide them to their future. These should be the characteristic of a mom...to raise the kids up and not to give up on them.",0
I think it should remain as a choice for the mother. What if the child is the result of a rape? What if the mother's life is in danger? What if the child is to be born with a life-threatening illness? I think the quality of life should be taken in to consideration and not necessarily the quantity. If the child was going to live perhaps twenty/thirty years with a debilitating disease is it fair to allow him or her to suffer with no prospect of ever being fully healthy?,1
Do you see your own point? Don't post on here any more. It's polluting the debate. You've haven't posted anything of original value here and you haven't even made a very good job of re-writing other's arguments either.,1
"I'll be more blunt. It isn't your responsibility to teach others moral lessons that involve contracting fatal diseases, or ruining their lives. Such behaviour is vindictive and arrogant.   That is your subjective opinion, I on the other hand disagree.  I think my 'lesson' is entirely valid...personal responsibility is very important.   It isn't arbitrary. It aligns with law.   What law, of which nation?  Besides laws can be changed.   Being against killing isn't much of an argument. We kill every day. As far as I and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned, killing a foetus is little different from killing an Apple when you made cider.   Utterly ridiculous.  An apple is a fruit and is not a multi cellular organism, such as a human foetus.  I do not kill human foetuses everyday and that is what we are discussing..not apples or plums or oranges...LOL",0
"And sex cells. ;) But besides that, that wasn't my point.     Then don't make it your point. you were the one that listed ""it has all the chromosomes"" as a reason it was a person. If it's not a reason, don't list it.  Now what am i supposed to think... ""not part of something else"" makes something a person? Do I really need to bother with the tearing apart of that one ? Besides being a silly criteria in and of itself, you do realize that the fetus doesn't stop being part of something else until the umbilical is cut?  There is one defining criteria of people that makes them people. It is very obvious what it is. ""Cogito ergo Sum"" isn't just a catchy saying. You're dancing around it listing these peripheral attributes like possession of chromosomes and structural coherence because you know that the fetus doesn't possess the primary one that actually matters.",1
"""What say you?""????  What century are you from? Oh wait, you're trying to be French in an English kinda way? hahahahahaha  Ok, was that ad hominem? hahahaha",1
"Please not that this debate has nothing to do with the legality of abortion. I believe that it is better off being legal, but moderated as well. If the mother wants an abortion bad enough she shall get the fetus out any way possible, but if it were illegal she would be going into dark alleys to get it done.",1
Exactly i know why i made that statement. If the fetus does not have life then why does the state and the federal government institutes a charge of double homicide if the fetus dies through the death of the mother because according to those supporting abortion the fetus does not have life. Are the laws therefore wrong?,0
"I'm a moderate on this issue. I believe abortion is 100% okay up until a certain point in the pregnancy, but during and after that point in the pregnancy, it's 100% wrong. Both radical sides of this argument are stupid; sorry. There won't be a solution to the abortion issue until people take a stance that isn't stupid and/or insane. Compromise on subjects that are not inherently black and white is the only want to go withing being unproductive.",1
"why shouldn't it matter? Doesn't everything deserve a chance? The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it. That's not fair to just say ""I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it.""   And you still didn't answer the question.",0
"Did you forget the following examples?  Hosea 13:16 (King James Version)  16Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.  Numbers 31:15-18 (King James Version)  15And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  16Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.  17Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  18But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  Hosea 9:11-17 (King James Version)  11As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.  12Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!  13Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  14Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.  15All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.  16Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.  17My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.  Judges 11:30-40 (King James Version)  30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,  31Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.  32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.  33And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.  34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.  35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.  36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.  37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.  38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.  39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,  40That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.  2 Kings 2:23-24 (King James Version)  23And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.  1 Samuel 15:2-3 (King James Version)  2Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.  3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.",1
"So basically you're saying: ""Let's be neutral about this issue and accomplish absolutely nothing. Taking a stand on what you believe in just causes problems no matter who you are, so it's best to just pull a Switzerland and not do anything."" Not only that, but you say that neutrality is the best morality as well? So when you have kids and they hit puberty, because of your ""neutrality"" mentality you'll tell them to do whatever they'd like, regardless of what's smart, responsible, or sensible? Good luck making tough decisions in life, my friend.  You seem to base your argument for neutrality off of logic. You say that neutrality is logical. I disagree. In an earlier post, I made a spirited argument of why logically, abortion is wrong, because according to the laws of reason that govern this earth, every action has a consequence, and to say that just because you don't want to face that consequence does not mean you don't have to.",0
"In your hypothetical, the woman is not aware of the impending accident. If a person goes hiking, they aren't expecting of an accident to occur, or they would not have undertaken it in the first place. Pregnancy is different because it requires sex which is a decision that everyone knows may result in pregnancy. Now you may think, ""Taking a hike in no man's land is also a decision that includes risk"" and you'd be right. But I believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion. I am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent (by deliberate decision or otherwise) they are responsible for the safety of that new human. Even to the extent of risking their own lives. That is my definition of assuming responsibility for the risks. That being said, I don't think there should be laws in place to  force  people to carry thorough a pregnancy, or donate blood to their injured child. But I believe it to be immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over that of their children. Born or not.",0

"//Abortion should not be legal for the simple reason that the baby that they are killing, is a person//  This argument is void because: 1) Abortion kills a process only; 2) A baby is the end result after the process has been completed; and 3) Personhood is a status that one is given upon birth (example: it's a birth certificate not a conception or fertilised egg certificate.)  //how would you feel if you were aborted//  If I were aborted, I had no consciousness to form a thought. To truthfully answer your question, I wouldn't care.  //...and dont say fetuses dont have feelings//  Ok, I won't, but let's see what the experts say:  ""there is increasing evidence that the fetus never experiences a state of true wakefulness in utero and is kept, by the presence of its chemical environment, in a continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation. This state can suppress higher cortical activation in the presence of intrusive external stimuli.""  http://www.rcog.org.uk/ fetal-awareness-review-research-and- recommendations-practice",1
"A fetus is not a parasite. Its an undeveloped human. No skin cells, hair follicles or any other bunch of cells. A undeveloped human. A woman has eggs for reproduction. These eggs have to be fertilized to create a fetus. If left unchecked as long as the fetus is healthy a human being will be formed inside the womans womb. If a woman doesnt want a child its her responsibility to prevent it from getting started. Women have plenty of ways to prevent unwanted prgnancy. Killing a fetus is wrong. Its a very young human. You can argue details but bottom line is it will one day, if all goes well,become a functioning member of the human race. Terminating this is murder. The question we need to ask is why do we have this problem in our ""advanced"" civilization. Most abortions are from unwanted pregnancy not rapes or medical conditions. Are women not ready for their rights? Mass murder of undeveloped humans because of irresponsibilty. We shouldn't condone this behavior as a womans right. WE should condemn because its a womans responsibility to be a mother when she decides to create a fetus.",0
Have you ever seen an ultrasound?  Have you ever seen a desperate teen change her mind to have an abortion after seeing her ultrasound?  Have you seen a 3-D ultrasound?  All these moments are life changing!,0
"Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.   I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion.   According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.    I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in  literally  every post since the issue came up. If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.   Abortion is legal.  Murder is not legal.  Therefor, legally, abortion cannot be murder.   And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus.    I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability.    Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.   Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you. An aborted fetus is equally incapable of developing into a human.",1
"I don't think that it should be completely pro life, but rather what the circumstances are. For example, if the abortion is because of rape, incest, mother's life is in danger, then I completely understand the reason. However, if abortion is done because protection, either a condom or birth control pills, were not used, then abortion should not be allowed. Be responsible for your own actions.",0
"I do not believe in abortion. You are killing a living breathing human being. I understand why certain people might want to get an abortion, i.e they were raped or can't afford to take care of it, but if that's the case then just give the child to someone else.     This is a human being:   http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring08/ images/amazing_human_being_01.jpg    This is a foetus:   http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/06/ foetusREX010606_228x188.jpg    It has no mind. It has no awareness. It is a burden to someone else. This is why abortion exists.",1
"As I said, some debates have much stronger arguments to one side.   1 is not 4.    I agree. If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4. 1 banana is not 4 bananas. One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4... For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it. In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people). But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.   If you have your arguments in order, every issue is debatable. It's just that some are closer to a consensus than others...",1
"No, you are way out in left field. Stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic. What does Hitler have to do with abortions? As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself. Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right? What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?  You stand by and watch people kill each other during war. What kind of love is this? Yes, you can do something concerning abortions. Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this. That is the main point of my argument. I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.  What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'? Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion. Apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin. Also, I need to know what your definition of judging is, since you disagree with mine.",0
firstly Is it not legal in the US ??   in Britain it has been legal for along time. and i know i sided with the YES however most valid points have been made and i would just like to say i believe that the time period needs to be properly looked at. 24 weeks and a baby is well a baby... not a feetus. and the abortion process at that stage is horrific. chopping up the baby to get it to fit our of the whom.... i do not want to go on.  but i think there should be a shorter limit on it. also if someone take so long to decide then they may be unsure or be being forced into it (may have been hiding it)..... should defiantly be more regulations. ect to ensure a safer system,1
I don't see anything wrong with abortion =/  --------------------------------------- ----,1
"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?  Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?  You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.  If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.  Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.  Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.  It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.  Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?  I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.  Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.",0
"Your link is the second step in my argument. I'll get to it soon.   But how...   Simple, the same reason a single sperm or a single egg cell are not human beings.    It seems to me...   Well that's how it seems to you. It seems to me that just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it human.   Just because...   Actually, depending on the stage in the pregnancy, it isn't a human being when the heart isn't beating. Then again, I believe the heart starts beating after it's become a human being during the pregnancy; I'm not exactly sure of the minuet time-frame specifics of most pregnancies.   By that logic...   You're assuming I'm totally pro-abortion, which I am not. My logic is not yet fully explained to you. Very simply, do I believe that fetus in the photo is a human being? Well, I'm fairly sure it is, but I'd need a doctor with a very expensive machine to tell me whether is it or not.",1
"Presently actually means ""soon"". Thus the sentences are practically the same.    Presently in my recollection of English means at the current moment. However, even if we borrow your meaning to read  ""It doesn't matter what it could become. It only matters what it will be soon.""  It follows from context that I don't care for the near-future but the more distant future, since that is when birth happens.",1

"Has teenage sex been rising or falling since sex education has been introduced?  Yes, there are tons of other reasons for this correlation. Sex is everywhere. Should it be in schools too? Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex? If you're going to start teaching them atleast do it once they're legally allowed to have sex. Maybe sex education could lead to a decrease in sexual activity - but with a conservative, not a liberal attitude.   I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.   You're wrong. They do it again all the time.  Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays (that's not including rape). Because of the attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them. But we all know that until the age of atleast 19 (and that's still young) nobody understands love. In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'.  Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex. Maybe that's because it was different times and there weren't tits in their face every other second. But atleast if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.",0
"So I do agree on what you say, ""society be responsible for a females irresponsibility"".  I wasn't making a statement. I actually disagree.  Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive. I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that. lol. We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity.  People should learn from their mistakes. If I killed someone - should I not be put in jail? As punishment - time for reflection etc? Or should I be allowed to continue because going to jail puts a burden on society, doesn't actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job etc. would be much harder?  You're right however. People born in poor conditions (which abortions tend to negate) tend to get caught up in the cycle. Abortion isn't the answer. Less sex - or sex only with the right people is.",0
Abortion is killing a life. Why is it illegal to kill a human life at 1 years old and it is legal to kill a human life before it is born before it has a chance to see the wonders of this world. Those who support abortion are just as guilty as those who go through with abortion! I REST MY CASE,0

"1. At this point in the baby's life, it does. The fetus is an individual human. A fetus is just a term for a body in the womb of a mother.  2. It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother. It is alive and an individual. Again there are people born who are never self-aware, some who never feel, so on your view are they not people? The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival, but so is a newborn, so is an infant, and so is a child. These are all different stages of development of an individual human being. It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life.  3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans. I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings; it gets us nowhere. Let's stick with medical facts.  4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you. In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism, akin to poisoning you to death. Not your nails or hair, but your entire self. If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded, comatose, and senile elderly. Moss and insects are a red herring.  You're getting too emotional with the argument. I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you. The fetus is a separate human life and deserves protection if any human deserves protection.  Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes?

"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws. Selling sex has to do with whether one has the freedom to choose in regards to their body which is however prevented by the laws.  You keep saying that the mother fetus relationship is parasitic but you are still failing to produce proper proof. The first evidence you produced is a blog. Who cares about a blog? Ablog is the exchange of information between people who talks about a subject. In the dictionary the term parasite was defined. Again anyone knows the definition of parasite so prove to me or produce any scientific findings that proved the fetus is a parasite. So far, you have failed to produce any proper evidence to prove that. All you keep doing is defining what the term parasite means and then applying it to the term fetus because of the existing relationship.   Source:   http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html                                           You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being. The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?  It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   Abortion again is the taking of a human life. Why do people not want to get pregnant? Because they are unable to accept responsiblity of the unborn for some reason or the other. So it is the process whereby the fetus is killed in a procedure.   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.",0
"how can you compare a spider to a human life!   Both are equally alive. Both have their own respective niches. For example, can you make your own webbing, or inject venom?   a spider is not creative, a spider is not capable of love or emotion, a spider is not very productive, and a spider is an insect not a human.   You're arguing that a spider is not a human, not that a spider is less alive than a human.   plus a fudus if you want to call it that does have a mind or else it would not be able to curl its toes and suck it's thumb nor would it be able to grow!   A foetus has a brain, but it has no identity yet. A foetus is incomplete, like an empty shell.",1
"The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime..   Let me ask you a question. Are you aware of foetal development? The first four weeks after having unprotected sex, there isn't even an embryo yet. Once you have the embryo it's weeks before it even develops into a foetus, which means it is a few cells with no mind or organs. 50% of abortions happen before the woman even has a foetus inside her. Once it becomes a foetus, it's another 7 to 9 weeks before it even has a heart pumping blood. The brain is still in the process of growing. 40% of abortions happen before this point in foetal development.  You are acting emotionally when you should be detached. This is a rational situation, not an emotional one.   It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.   The unborn baby has no rights at this point. It isn't a person yet. Maybe it bothers you to think of people in a way that allows them at some point to no longer be people. Humanity doesn't suffer from abortions, the only way it could suffer is if abortions were so common that our death rate exceeded our birth rate, but this isn't the case. Morals and god are irrelevant, because those are beliefs and values that belong to you and only you, they aren't exactly shared by the women having abortions so it is a case of you imposing your god and your morals upon someone else against their will.   Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?!   The woman is taking responsibility by terminating the pregnancy. In her case it would be irresponsible to have a child that isn't wanted and would grow up lacking the support it needs.   Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?!   Protected sex can lead to pregnancy, depending upon the failure rates of the contraceptives used. Also bear in mind that the religious groups you're supporting by bringing god into this are often against contraception, and spread misinformation about it, such as ""condoms contain holes"" or ""condoms have HIV inside of them."" In this respect they are against the methods that prevent pregnancy and are against the tools that stop pregnancy as well, they seem to want women to function as baby-factories, or live a celibate lifestyle.   In the case where you were ""raped"", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever..   And then she has a child who is a reminder of the man who abused her. The child will suffer for this, and that's how you end up with a more dysfunctional society: children neglected by their mothers who wind up on the streets as thieves or gang members.   In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?!   If it's unexpected, it could be that the child will be raised in poverty because the mother can't afford it.   No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...   Yet you're here telling pregnant women what their fate should be.",1
I agree with you. We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.,0
"You know what puzzles me……?  Here we have a picture that the pro-abort side DOES NOT WANT SHOWN. It factually is true and this is how a later term abortion happens. It happens the same way however in earlier abortions…the baby is just smaller. But never the less body parts still are dissected and torn from the fetus alive…until it is dead. So this is the face of abortion…FACT.   What gets me is this. Most everyone here I presume is pro-choice. Why?  They believe that the woman should have the rights to her body and that its a personal decision that only she can make. She should not be burdened by carrying something she does not want…and she may do this for any reason. Abortion should be legal so that if she decides to kill her baby she can.   So why does this picture…upset pro-aborts/choicers? If they embrace abortion for all the right reasons….then what is so wrong with it?   Is killing a living human being bad? No says the pro-choice side. Why the emotion from this side for being called pro-abortion? Is there something your not telling us? Certainly you don't advocate something you find immoral..right?   If abortion should be legal…because its the woman body her decision. Then how many of you would agree that even late term abortions like this….are ok?  LOL  How many of you would want to enslave her in later terms just because you find late term abortions repulsive and wrong. The baby looks more like a baby….and gee, just tugs on your heartstrings doesn't it…..sigh.",0
Choosing adoption as an alternative to abortion would give the baby its right to life.,0
Like i said you need someone to interpret the Bible for you so...  Here is a link:  http://www.godandscience. org/apologetics/ notkill.html#r0N2AWDBfggn,0
"When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant.   Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?    You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do?   Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.    Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong?   No, I wouldn’t want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it (assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception). Religious ethics based on the idea of ‘sin’ or ‘evil’ has no effect on my decision; it’s about how I was raised.   What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Abortion is a murder.   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   But everybody has a right to be wrong.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.    Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion.   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really  fix  it?   How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.  I am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place. As for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control, i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want's to be a mom or have an abortion. I don't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions. If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.",1
"So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY   You really are a sexist pig. The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy. It's not solely a woman.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion   Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that. I'm not saying you  should  abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do.   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die?    You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever. I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people  should . But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does.   .Hitler had the same idea did you know that?   Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler. It's so rude.   You are making excuses for the killing.   I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations. Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks   I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low. Hence I said ""life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)"" Oh and in response to your question about I meant, I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish. But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so. And don't call me a hypocrite, because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances.   What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time   This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all? A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort. And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active, and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception. If you couldn't be bothered to read it that's your problem.",1
"Alright, I can tell you are either very young or have some kind of mental handicap as you have great difficulty grasping the subtleties of language that aren't explicitly explained to you.   I called you a hypocrite because you believe you have the right to force others to conform to your preferences while I don't regardless of the fact that the body in question belongs to neither of us.   I don't care about your sob story. I really don't. If you can't debate outside of emotional appeals then we are done here. You lose.",1
"Furthermore,, the verse in the Qur'aan that u referred to has got nothing to do with abortion.. it has to do with Christians..   Both the Koran and Bible verses support killing, in a manner that is illegal and therefore murder.  This contradicts your statement of   There is no religion that approves of murder! And it does involve a life that God and only God created.. so who are you to take away this life?!    Yes i did read the Qur'aan.. unfortunately though, when i came to read the Bible,, i didn't know which to believe because they each said something different even though they were supposed to be the same verses.. How can you have a New International Version(aka New Testament) of a HOLY book that was written by God in the first place and there are no messengers left in the world to reveal it??!   They are translations from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek or Arabic depending upon the verse. Those languages are not divine, however, they are human.",1
Do you have any evidence to suggest that the fetus is more of a parasitic entity?

"""Atheism is a religion""  No it's not. I view atheism is the theory that there isn't a god, and under those contexts it isn't a religion because it doesn't group in any way shape or form.  ""I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....""  Yes I dropped the fear of being open in my views no matter how extreme they are. Cold, maybe, but compassionless? No, at least not by the standard I hold myself to believing that it helps society. Empty? definitely not, my view has a defined purpose that only seems wrong by the dim standards developed by the main religions of the world.(you will hear me criticize religion whenever I see logic spawned from religion born patterns of thinking.  ""I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.""  I respectfully agree.  ""Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close.""   I respect Hitler's ability to have fixed the economy of Germany, yes. I don't care for the extermination of a race, no. I don't believe it's wrong to admire the positive side to a negative situation.  ""They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb""  I do believe it's right(womb not the killing of functioning members of society), Im not going to play the shifty democrat here and change my positions constantly which will appall you in the coming comment most likely.   ""Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated?""  Yes I do because that is a solution to quell inheritable diseases in our species that produce members that cannot add anything to society, let alone enjoy a standard of independent life(this view applies to major disabilities, I am undecided on minor diseases that produce somewhat capable members.) As of IQ, I would love to be rid of stupid people but stupidity supplies the labor of current society I guess so not much can be done there.  ""Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.""   And there are children that grow up in an orphanage, tormented by the fact that not only did their parents not want them ,nobody else did either. That is a foundation of an unstable mind that could result in something very bad.  ""Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone. ""  It increases happy family rates by keeping the family unit at a desired number.  ""Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share""  The stigma you refer to only exists due to the unfortunate inescapable entity that is religion. And if living with an abortion is hard, then living with a child you can't take care of is harder. My evidence for that last statement being me and my mother.  ""Studies show that what I am saying is true.""   Not disputing what you are saying is true, just disputing the meaning and reason behind it.   ""If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over""   The statistics however few I have presented are more or less citations from my private political theory professor Hollis. Wish I knew her first name but never felt the need to until years after being taught.   ""Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education?""   Again a loose citation but this one is more obvious. In countries with a higher reproduction rate then normal almost always live in poverty or at the very least a low standard of living. Bangladesh anyone? However, in countries with a normal or even lower then normal reproduction rate, the level of education is much higher, and that isn't by any means hard to justify.   ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24&#xNo;w this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  Okay? I also believe in using abortion as a birth control, although the pill seems a much better option to me.  ""Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion""  Well repetition is the way to learn i guess.   ""Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up?""  No I said the educational level of the family unit goes up, which is true, due to the fact that when you aren't forced to pay for the schooling of a kid you didn't want, then you have much more to get better schooling for a kid you did want.  ""Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically. She talked at KKK meetings encouraging its members to target blacks. The Negro Project, Eugenic plan for Blacks....read them they will tell you all about her racism. ""  I don't care about her being racist. Racism is just a held view, no different then holding a preference over pulp or pulp free in your orange juice. In the field of political theory, in which I have a considerable holding, racism doesn't exist, only racial preference which actually for the sake of argument increases effectiveness among a people. Attack that if you must, but bear in mind I still have not indicated whether or not I have a preference, so don't waste too much time on it.  ""The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order,"" Sanger said.""  It is quite the negative influence when we consider the very structure of the human mind mixed with the animalistic side of our species that society strives so hard to contain, but that is a part of society not likely too change.  ""She was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks. She was an inspiration to Hitler...and obviously her views still guide PP and others like you today.""  I am not for forced abortion or mass sterilization of blacks, I merely hold that abortions are a greatly positive thing in society and shouldn't by any means be discouraged. I don't care much about racial differences except how they pertain to statistics involving the economy. And like I said before, I may agree with some parts of a persons beliefs and not the other. Just because I may or may not agree with some similarly held beliefs of Margaret Sanger does not mean I by any means am inspired by her.  ""Your thinking is dangerous to society. You presume to know what is good for society...and that good has all to do with killing. Both Hitler and Sanger believed what you are saying. Look where Hitlers worldview took him.....and the others he mass murdered.""  Dangerous? No more so then religion is. At least my ""danger"" is in the name of logical progression of society and whether or not you see it that way is irrelevant. You seem to refer to Hitler in most of your debates, I believe Mao Zedong would be a much better example for the logic you are using, just a suggestion.   ""I find what you say about men and abortion commical. I am certainly praying at this point you have no children and won't. I can only imagine how they would be raised.""  I be a wonderful dad, I would let them grow their own beliefs on god and structure, those things are up to them to figure out. My duty would be protection and learning of basic functions. It is not my place in my standing to dictate how my child views thing in the world around him. If he wants to be pro life, all the power to him, as long as he(or she) truly believes in what the hold I am fine.   ""You say the woman should have the say.....and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby. Ahhhh you poor thing....not included.""  Yes i do believe that. I don't think he should be able to back out if he decides to pay child support, but I do believe he should have a choice. That is probably the most destructive belief I have portrayed, but to win some you gotta give some, and the women won rights to chose whether or not they have an abortion.  ""Libertarian worldview.....all about themselves, nothing about anyone else...a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life. Liberty for your kind is slavery, killing those they think are unworthy to live. Freedom of expression for you people is the gun....pointed at someones head. No absolutes....people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society, even if it hurts their own family. ""  That is incorrect to the extreme but I am not here to argue my party standings. I could go on about your religion and get quite insulting, but for the sake of argument I hope you will drop your attacks on the Libertarian party and respect us for our views as I have respected you without insult(if one has slipped through the cracks I apologize, but I don't remember making an insult).   ""Your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral...that speak to your conscience and lack of one. For you rape could be good in some circumstances....and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live. God only knows who is in that group.""  Yes they are radical, I am not going to deny that. And there is no such thing as moral or right or wrong. I think in terms such as beneficial and destructive. And god doesn't know because he doesn't exist. I may seem colder then usually imaginable, but when faced with issue such as abortion we must think about what is best for society. And I am actually quite the party animal, but here I am here to be logical and maybe have a beer when done.   ""Your worldview is not logical at all in fact I find it hidiously evil and dangerous. It strips away the preciousness of life and living. What a sad world you live in. Which is why those that value life....need to keep you close.""  It is logical as all my views come from a deep understanding of political theory and my understanding of what makes the human mind and what differentiates it from that of an animal(not much). No such thing as evil, said that already. And you misunderstand my intentions. In benefiting society we promote what makes us human.

This scenario does happen, however, it is much rarer that most believe, most abortions are from irresponsible sex but regardless it is still no reason to kill a human.

"Per EHow.com...""The are five methods used when performing an abortion. The first is called Manual Vacuum Aspiration and can be used early in the pregnancy. The doctor inserts a thin tube into the woman's uterus and sucks the embryo out with the syringe attached at the end of the tube. The second, Suction Curettage, is the most common kind of abortion and can be performed later in the pregnancy. The doctor must stretch the cervix with rods, due to the size of the baby, and then inserts a plastic tube that is connected to a suction machine. Once inserted, the baby's body is and suctioned out in pieces. The third is called Dilation and Evacuation and is considered a second trimester abortion. At this stage, the baby is too big to be broken apart by only the use of suction. Seaweed rods are inserted into the woman a day or two before the procedure to stretch her cervix. The doctor will use forceps to pull the fetus out of the woman. A looped knife called a curette is used to scrape remaining fetal parts out of the woman's body. The fourth method is called a Dilation and Extraction, and can be through full term. This procedure takes three days, and during the first two, seaweed rods are used again to stretch the cervix. The doctor will then use an ultrasound to locate the baby's legs, taking them with forceps and pulling every part out with the exception of its head. He will then make a cut into the baby's skull, suctioning out its brains which, makes it easier to pull the baby out of the woman's body. Finally, there is the development of RU 486, an abortion pill. Early in her pregnancy, a woman is given a pill in the doctor's office to abort the embryo and is sent home with 2 to 3 pills to be inserted vaginally. This will induce stomach cramps and expel the embryo.

If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain. And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection? No. Made it rare? most certainly. And what happened after Roe vs Wade? abortions went through the roof. Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite. it sanctions it.   Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group. Why? Zero Population growth. They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it. Europe will be a Muslim nation within our lifetime, Why? They're having families.   So please tell me why we should follow the Europeans into extinction?",0
"A fetus does not have an informed conscious(at least there is no scientific proof) and thus it could not make a choice of death over adoption or life and thus it means nothing to ask ""What choice do you think the unborn babies would make"" as this is an appeal to emotion.  Also to complain that governments force people against their religion to pay with their taxes for abortion seems hypocritical and naive. If you don't want government to use your tax dollars for abortions because it is against your religion why should the government support tax breaks for religion and your church? because not everyone follows a particular religion yet they end up paying for it. Also don't forget that some churches of various religions work very hard to impose their doctrine/beliefs on to others of which they have no right.   Also all of your sources are biased towards pro-life where their mission is only to support pro-life so how credible is it?",1
"No answer to my retort, just a down vote. That helps alot!?",1
"Honestly, your statement is both unintelligible and unintelligent.   No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it. If you think that being insulting is a fitting way to encourage in depth reasoning you are to say the least mistaken.   What are you saying here? Are you actually suggesting that the baby has a choice in the matter?   How in the world would you come up with that based on what he typed? Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion. Do a poll at the site and I bet most people would agree that YOU missed the OBVIOUS here in your rush to ridicule.   An unjustified assertion.   He did too justify it. He presented an alternative that doesn't involve an unnecessary surgery and in which the life of the developing child is cherished instead of treated like trash.",1
I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is:  abortion takes the life of an innocent human being  That' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it? And genetically it is human. It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it.   Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.,0
"Yes I do, because I think clarity is more important than agreement and I'm trying to be precise in my thinking. I don't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates. I ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of. Asking the question of personhood doesn't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is. They tell us something about the thing but they don't tell us what the thing in question is. To know that requires an ontological question and that's why I ask; what is it? And you are correct, it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood, assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is. And humans are the sort of things that have personhood; it's not what they are but a characteristic they posses.  Now I think the question, what is it, is one you would ask instinctively. What do I mean. Assuming you have a child, what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked; can I kill it? I'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be; what is it? And if it was the fly that's been bugging you, you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no. You see your answer hinges on the question; what is it and no other question. I hope you can see that. And the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know, instinctively, that humans aren't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly, it requires proper justification. That's why I oppose abortion. Killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil.   BTW insult is not an argument, it's what you do when your position is unsound. You try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good. But notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand, it has no bearing on it. That my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an Ad hominem. You don't actually answer the question, you just obscure it and that's the opposite of clarity.",0
"Ok, let's just agree that ""one man DOES make a difference"". That difference however, can be positive or negative. I have already said that he could turn out to be a peace loving buhdah, or he could be worse then Hitler. It's all a possibility... Let's not get into possibilities... we could be here forever arguing about things that will never be.",1
"Old age? How's that work? No ""human being"" is going to be dependent on the womb of another for more than about 10 months. Once it's out of the womb, it is by definition no longer dependent on said womb for survival.  The standard is flexible, not arbitrary. It is flexible to a certain defined degree (as it should be) and that degree should, to my thinking, correspond to the level of prenatal physiological development. In other words, rights vest as the being grows and matures.",1
And also if you define the term law then you would see that the definition of law is different from the definition of politics.,0
"I am surprised you say that you don't care about what the laws say. Try telling that to a trial judge. Anyway, it is good that you made that point because a fetus is at a point where the brain is now developing making them unaware of the surrounding which is why people refers to them as being in the baby stage. But you are failing to understand that because of the destruction of those cells, the life of the person might be in danger which is why a criminal charge has to be instituted. The type of cells and tissues however that we are referring to is referred to as a developing human being who is growing into complete human form with a complete DNA and blood type. But didn't you say that what a woman does with her body is nobody's business then how come there are laws to prevent her from prostituting her body?  Okay. According to statistics released by the WHO in terms of abortion, the number of abortions that performed for the year 1995- 45.5 million of which 19.9 million were illegal.  According to a report from The Guttmacher Institute, Unsafe abortion causes an estimated 70,000 deaths each year, and an additional five million women are treated annually for complications resulting from unsafe abortion. Approximately three million women who experience serious complications from unsafe procedures go untreated.  The following methods describe the different methods of abortion. Since you are also a person of science read up on horrifying methods of abortion in which we do not even do this with animals;  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068  I agree but the only purpose abortion serves is to kill the fetus, a human life or organism. Condom does something better than what abortion does. Condom prevents the spread of diseases. And i also agree but how can it be explicit language when i have proof to back up my opinion released by the U.S Gov? Are we aborting a fetus because of fear of infection?  That i will agree with you. I am but a teenager not a child. There is a difference between a teenager and a child. A child is an individual who has not meet the stage of puberty. A teenager is an individual who has or is already going through the stage of puberty. And i also agree with you that there many things i can learn from adults, as long as i am learning it from the correct source. Well we are not discussing a debate based on politics; we are discussing abortion and the law. And i also agree with you that i do have a lot to learn. Oh and by the way now you are starting to use your critical thinking skills. I love that. Now i feel tha twe can openly discuss any topic.",0
"I know the way I would state my opinions would not prove helpful towards this discussion, so here is a quote, in place, by respected novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand. I find that this quote, in the end, sums up my opinions on this matter.  ""An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn). Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?""",1
"It would be really unfair if the mother was raped and she has to bear the emotional pain of having the child. If the mother was careless and say she was in high school, she would have to drop out of high school to take care of her child. In this cases I think abortion should be legal. Its true that the mother should have been more careful but should she ruin her whole life with one mistake? Through all this what about the child's feelings? If the mother was raped would she be able to take care of the child properly without having a emotional grudge against the child. I heard that the pain from rape never truly leaves you, you move on but you never truly get over it. The child would also have to grow up without a father. If the mother gave birth to the child in high school, she would have to drop out. The child will not be able to receive the full attention the child deserves from his mother if shes trying to take care of the child and study/work at the same time. It would be even worse if the father did not take responsibility like in some cases of teenage pregnancy. In other cases where women of any age are pregnant but are not prepared to take care of the child they give the child for adoption. The child would grow up in an orphanage without ever knowing his real parents. If the child is adopted, how would the child feel? The child might live with hate for his biological parents for as long as he lives and if he is not, does the child deserve to grow up in an orphanage without parents? So this is why I support abortion.",1
"If I masterbate into a woman's vagina instead of the shower drain it's ""potential life"" as well. Yet the bible says ""it's better to spill your seed on the belly of a prostitute than to let one drop hit the dirt""  So basically it's okay to pull out, therefore it must be okay to wear a condom, therefore it must be okay to get rid of a cluster of cells (sperm's a cluster of cells just like that virus in the woman's belly before the third trimester).  Really the only lesson your silly book teaches on this is that hiring a prostitute is healthier than jacking off all the time... which I agree with by the way. If only Christians knew the bible as well as atheists I might get along better with you idiots.  Anyway, once again this is a case of religion creating a boogie man to control the masses through fear, and everyone forgets what it was like when abortion really was illegal because crazy ass stories are easier to remember than history apparently.  The only thing making abortion illegal decreases in the entire history of mankind, is the number of women who have safe abortions. It doesn't decrease the number of abortions, just the number of safe abortions.",1
"I said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. But even rape has neutrality in it. Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler, a murderer of innocent people. Is that evil? No. Fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral.   There is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. You can't, I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you.  It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? No. And yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. Have you no imagination? Here's a scenario: You are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. Is that love wrong? Just because there is an age gap? Not necessarily. Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are.   What Hitler did WAS wrong, did I dispute that it wasn't? But in fact, it was gray in some areas. Why? Because he saved Germany. He did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil.  The 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. Yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. Even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil.  It's meant to be contradictory. I don't believe in either radical, I trust in the balance between the two which I explained. Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time? I'm not pro-choice, I'm just on this side of the debate. The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point.  Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Also, yes, I am God. I am a Pantheist. But that has nothing to do with this debate.  If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist. Duh.  No, I am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. The point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human.  Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. So no, I am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean.  Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. Though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. What is wrong with you?",1
"Like i said you need someone to interpret the Bible for you so...

"Oh, had I been aborted, I couldn't have imagined anything. But then your intellect should have provided you with your own answer.  Abortion is over very quickly indeed, and completely painless in the first trimester and a month and a bit after. The nervous system has not yet been totally formed; thus, according to medical literature, the zygote feels nothing.  Had I been aborted, I would have been spared the agony of dealing with hypocrites--the most prevalent and destructive types the human race has ever known.   I think the best piece of advice I could offer anyone is that they live the best possible life doing the least amount of harm. Although, having said that, if you really mean well to others, climb aboard the band wagon that's headed towards the non wholesale slaughter of human beings. Can you say, ""WAR""?",1
"Because sexual activity is awesome and a sign of good health. It is a primal action that is at the foundation of humans' hierarchy of needs (according to Maslow:  http://www.colinchristianson.com/ wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ 800px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needssvg.png)                                         ) So stopping sex is not the solution to the abortion debate. People do need to be careful and do need to be held accountable for their actions, but accidents happen and shouldn't people be able to have a choice in how to deal with such a life-altering event?",1
"Am I to gain from this the understanding that you believe abortions are acceptable in the occasional case that the pregnancy is harmful?  If so, if the fact that the fetus is not a child 'makes no difference to the morality of the action', then why allow would you allow abortion in any case, ever? There are no cases in which the murder of a two-year-old is permissible and if a fetus and a two-year-old are interchangeable, what is the difference? If the end result is identical for the fetus, why would motivation make a difference?",1

"Maybe the one who referred to the Freakonomics theory of abortion never finished the chapter, because at the end he goes on to compare how many deaths were spared by allowing abortion, vs how many prebirth baby deaths were caused by abortion.

"It doesn't matter what it could become. It only matters what it is presently.   That is the problem with people like you isnt it?  You don't see the bigger picture.

You remind me of Hitler in fact...he destroyed human beings he did not consider human too....perhaps you will meet him in Hell.....you could be lovers ;)",0
"The question is not what makes us a person. The question is; what is it?  Genetics tells us that it is human, although in the early stages of development.   An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people   This argument had some weight before the ultrasound. But in this day and age with 3D and 4D imagining it is simply naive.   But let's say your right and we don't know at what point the unborn embryo/fetus gains the rights of a full grown person. Why not err on the side of life? If we don't know it would seem wise to use caution and restraint. Therefore to allow abortion on demand would be the height of folly.  So in conclusion; if we don't know when a fetus becomes a person we should ban abortion because it might take the life of a person.",0

If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.   Yes, human lives are valuable, but like I said, we're in no danger of extinction. All these measures such as laws against murder, hospitals, national health care, etc... are preliminary steps. Laws to mandate the saving of every possible human fetus would probably be the last thing to do... This may be necessary if something all of a sudden killed 90% of humans on Earth, for example.",1
