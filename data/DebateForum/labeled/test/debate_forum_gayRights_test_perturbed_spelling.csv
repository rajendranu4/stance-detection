117,Well considering we hvae a OVEt populated planet already instead of having to rule how many children a family is allowed to have like China. Why is more gays a bad thing if gay marriage will lead to a slow down in population growth then why hasn't it been legalized sooner? Would you rather have no gay marriage and a over populated plant where children are starving due to having a insignificant amount of food because that is where we are now and going more so to in the near future.,1
60,y not!?!?!?!! marriage makes a libk between two people. let it be a man and a woman. a man and a man etc etc. if two males are happy to be together then y not make them happy. y should we be a hurdle. this is a natural phenomenon and if such a thing happens we as humans shoulf support them. its none of our business!!,1
94,I don't think  any  couples without good moral stnadards should asopt. That includes homosexuals. If it makes you feel any better that also includes a  whole lot  of straight people.   I believe the sexual orientation does bare on one's moral standing. Why am I a fool for thinking that?,0
181,OH food grief How close mnided can one nutter be? Someone that chooses to be gay does it on their own one way or the other. Its not your business who someone finds attractive or falls in love with.,1

178,"I do believe that gays should adopt children. In my lfie I've swen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have...and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world. I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing.  I tell you what I've experienced personally and do not resort to the ""fact"" sheets. The facts are not in yet to any great degree in either direction. In 5-10 years we will have a greater amount of statistics to go by.",1

If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.  I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.",1
56,"but a divorced, widowed, or adopted fmaily is not as strobg as a traditional home. This is just the way it is, however unfair. Children from these families are more likely to struggle.  Unfortunately, the govt job isn't to make sure everyone is treated fairly. This would be an impossible and expensive task (this is where we probably will disagree if you don't believe in very limited constitutional govt, which very few people believe in anymore). Besides, right now marriage IS equal: everyone can marry a member of the opposite sex. There is no inequality here. If we want to give people the right to marry members of the same sex, then let's do it, but this is, in fact, a change.  Before you call bigot, I am, in fact, not very religious and literally DON'T CARE if gays marry. It doesn't affect my life at all. I have two friends, a gay couple, who would make a perfect marriage. I just think people need to step away from their high emotions and look at this issue from the larger perspective. Also, everyone has a right to their own opinion and religion isn't bigotry. Even though I don't agree, if you don't want to vote for gay marriage because it's against your religion, congratulations, you have that right. In fact, this right actually IS a right, whereas marriage is nowhere in the constitution and not guaranteed to anyone. Don't like it? Change it! That is your right!",0
97,"I don't think the religious world shoulf have to alter their views on gay marriage at all. I think they should ignore it entirely. I don't think religions are outdated either. Christianity, for example, is based on worshiping a God who sent his  son  (male) to Earth and his  son  picked 12  men , the apostles to be his advocates. There were many more prominent men in the Bible, not because of today's society, but because men were higher than women in that time period. The time period has influenced many practices that remain today. Well that was a nice little side-track from the debate topic. :)",1

I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with me, but I think there is a baseline group of gay people and then a huge amount of other people who are gay because of peer pressure, insecurity, and/or because it's the popular thing to be right now.

119,"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree witg you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed.   Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing.   Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation.   Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption.",1

155,"No, you're telling gsys to stop fighting for equal marriage rights, and maknig the assumption that gays  aren't  doing the other things you mention like fighting for domestic partnerships or civil unions in places where there is no recognition of homosexual couples. You also seem to imply that there are homosexuals who have put their relationships on hold until gay marriage is legal... which, is obviously ridiculous.  First: the vote was 57% for the ban on adoption, and 43% against, so in no way is it an overwhelming majority of the population that is against homosexuals adopting.  Second: I'm not saying necessarily that people despise homosexuals, only that they want to stop them from getting married. Most of these people probably wouldn't be outwardly hostile (though some might) but instead just avoid them. Most of these people clearly have been taught that homosexuality is wrong and that the  right  thing to do is to outlaw the marriage.  Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?  Fourth: Things like racism or prejudice against a group tend to be because someone has never met someone from that group. By forcing people who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance there opinions will change. At the very least, those children who might have grown up to be intolerant will be more used to the idea of gay couples.... especially if their friends have parents who are gay. Just look at the progress that has been made as far as racism since the 1960's. People were against the laws that ended things like segregation. In some southern states it was even the majority that opposed an end to segregation. Go down there now and see how many people would support segregation. Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights, because no one should have their rights stripped by popular vote.",1

Before individuals start accusing me of being homophobic, homosexuality should be accepted as part of life however the raising of children in a same sex household has many questions unanswered.  Dr Albert Dean Byrd a well educated child and family pyschologist has researched this topic for sometime and he found that children throughout their developmental stages need a MOTHER and a FATHER.   He states  ""Children raised in homes with both mothers and fathers navigate the  developmental stages more easily, are more solid and secure in their sense of  self and in their sense of gender identity, perform better in the school system,  have fewer social and emotional problems and become better functioning  adults.""  He further points out the roles the Mother and Father play in the up bringing of a child.   ""Mothers use touch to calm, soothe and to bring comfort to children. When mothers  reach for children, they frequently bring them to their breasts to provide safety,  warmth and security. Father’s touch is most often described as playful and  stimulating, bringing with it a sense of excitement to the child.""

156,"Helko,  Pardon the delay.  Is sex a criem? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual.   All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire.   The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.  All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful.   The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:  1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person.

104,"All homosexuals, male or femael, who woukd adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females.   In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.  Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.",0

If God didn't plan for gays to exist, they wouldn't exist. Also, plenty of people don't really care what you think God wants or doesn't want, and you have realize not everyone is a Christian or chooses to follow all Christian ideals. By no means should a purely religious restriction  ever  be legalized.    Plus, you need 2 different sexes to make a normal family work, you need breast milk, you need sperm cells, you need egg cell, you need both the female and the male to function as a normal family, and in my opinion, gay married couples are not a normall functioning family.   This logic would make it illegal to be: an infertile married couple, a single parent, a married couple that adopted children, an elderly ,married couple, a married couple that is childfree by choice, or any other situation where a family consists of something other than a woman legally wed to a man and raising his kids.

143,"""If there's a gene that ramdomly causes homoseuxality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""   I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.  Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.  Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.  This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.  I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene.   The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool.",1

1,"First off sharpiron, I don't hvae anything against you as a pwrson. But have you looked at the world lately, it is already to the point that sexual deviants thrive in this world. That isn't gay peoples fault. The fact that molestation, insert, rape and child pornography and adultery happen is proof of that. Very few are ever held accountable for their actions. Politicians are caught doing it all the time, and its passed off as a ""simple mistake"". Especially if it is a heterosexual act.   The act of allowing two men or two women to marry does not hurt anyone or even family values, because we just want the same thing straight people already have and take for granted. Acceptance in this world to be able to love whom we want to love. Monogamous, loving relationships with someone of the same gender. We want families and children and the love and respect and adoration from someone who pledges their life to us as we pledge our life to them.   I was raised in a loving Christian home, my grandmother was my preacher until I was 30. I love God and always have even from the time I was a small child. I was raised to believe that all homosexuals were going to hell and that the only cure was a good woman. So at the age of 20 I married. I cried and prayed many nights for God to make the thought of a man be repulsive to me and after 11 years of marriage I finally realized I was gay and had been all along. My feelings for men had been with me since I was young, the first memory I have was at the age of 11. I so desperately wanted to fit in, to be accepted by my family, to go to Heaven. It took me 19 years to realize that I am still God's child and he loves me, even as a gay man. It was definitely hard to understand after years of being told how horrible and wrong all gay people were, only to realize I had been trying to be something I wasn't and it was slowly killing me from the inside out. Many times I just prayed for God to kill me. But it never came. Once I finally accepted who I was, who I had always been, God gave me the peace I needed.  My own mother stated she wished she had never had me and most of my blood relatives have nothing to do with me. You know the scripture that says to not be unequally yoked, well apparently my love for God wasn't enough. I was escorted from my church and told not to come back until I was ready to renounce my sexuality and come back to the fold. I don't blame God for what others do in his name. I am sad that my family isn't judgement free like they claim to be. I am sad that they will never know the man I love and have loved faithfully for over two years. I plan to marry him, with or without a marriage certificate. The way I see it, Adam and Eve didn't need a piece of paper to be married, and neither do I. Marriage is a state of mind and a way of life. Even the most married people fall into infidelity because the words they spake didn't mean anything. So gay or straight if your heart isn't in it, is it really a marriage.   I wish everyone would just worry about themselves and recognize the hurt they cause by telling others to do as they say and not what they do. I hope everyone out there that may read this can get the sense that I am Gay, I am in a loving relationship with a man, I am a God fearing and God loving man. And God loves me for who I am, not what the world thinks I should be.",1

135,"Well thanks for the advice srraight boy but qutie frankly, you don't know your ass from your elbow when it comes to gay rights, what we want or what we deserve as human beings. It's not the word they object to...it's the entire concept. Your analogy of the homeless guy needing a bed to sleep in is about as demented as you are.   Joe, I don't give a twaddle if you agree with me on any issue but the one thing you're wrong about is that I ever expected you to share my views nor do I expect that from anyone here or in my life. That's not friendship, that's being a puppet at someone else's whim. Being a friend Joe means that one must choose words carefully when you know that the other person is offended or hurt by the subject matter. You don't make a joke about it, at the very least! Think about what I said on the debate when that person was looking for your retirement from this site. I said what I did because it was wrong and you were my ally even though I was still bruised from the last brouhaha regarding Repubgal. You were so busy trying to think of unfunny things to say you couldn't think for one moment that I may have needed some words of encouragement from you on that board! And another thing....you seem to think you have to accept MY decision to relegate you to the cheap seats and name you an enemy. I don't need your permission to do that and I don't care if you like it or not.   And if you're going to quote the Serenity Prayer, why don't you try and get it right. Perhaps the real prayer will mean more than Joe's version of it. It goes like this Boffo:  God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference.  I don't need to feel better but perhaps you do. I can only hope that someday you can comprehend its meaning.",1
107,"I never thouhht for one moment taht you were different in any way shape or form. I have had, and have to this day, gay friends that I never thought were any different. And since I have friends on both sides of the fence, I feel more like someone in the middle of a battle field. I hear both sides and figured I may be able to get one group to bypass the other. However, my solution falls short in that, although it gets homosexuals the rights they're after, it doesn't buy them acceptance. For example, it doesn't get them religious wedding ceremonies from some religions.  BTW, a little more about my personal life, if you're interested. When I was a child I loved to play with toy soldiers. I would spend hours setting them up. Once I asked my sister to play and she immediately started a battle. I said, ""What are you doing?"" She said, ""Well...., they're soldiers. They are doing what soldiers do."" I said, ""No! they're supposed to make treaties!"" She said, ""That's boring!"" and left. Later that night my grandmother said that it was time to go to bed and that I had to clear the soldiers off the bed. So I had a small skirmish so that I could go to bed and not have to put away those soldiers that were under the bed. In the morning I continued playing but I don't remember if the survivors had a funeral for those who died the night before or if they managed to resurrect them somehow. I guess that little boy that was always wanting to make peace is still alive and well in me. ;)",0
176,"Syas who? There is no written protection anywhere in the constitutiom saying so. It can be inferred, perhaps, but it is not a guaranteed right. As such, the majority can vote on this issue any way they like until the constitution is changed in a legal fashion (i.e. the legislative branch).    1. Life - (cf. right to live, right to life)   2. Liberty (cf. freedom, personal liberty)   3. the pursuit of Happiness (cf. personal fulfillment, professional accomplishment, basic comforts, human pleasures, luxuries, vices)   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   OK I do agree with you here morality can be subject to opinion but in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it does say:   All human beings are born free and  equal  in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of  brotherhood .     Everyone  is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.   It is only because of the time when this was written that it does not state Sexuality as it was written in 1948 and Homosexuality has only become legal in most countries since the 70's.   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist   See first right from Declaration. OK I agree again with you that the specifics are vague and do not include marriage, in countries where Gay marriage is legal those people have their rights.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   It was because of the name calling that I got involved in the first place, as I have said before it is everyones right to religious beliefs and I believe that if they want to go about celebrating their beliefs then that is OK too, where it stops being OK is when they try to use their scriptures to affect laws in secular societies by demonising Homosexuals and trying to change the attitudes of the people. I also have gay friends and family and I coming from a strict Roman Catholic house have witnessed the devastating effect these beliefs can have on a persons mentality and general well-being, there is a friend of the family that was beaten so badly for being Gay that he had to move away.   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder?   There is no logic in the equation as the two are far from equal, murder robs people of their dignity, right to life and robs families of loved ones and causes nothing but pain it is a heinous act. Homosexuality creates no victim or pain or loss of dignity, etc.   Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   Many people don't and religious people are entitled to vote just the same as everyone else, it would be that if they kept to this right and not infringe on the rights of others that their case could be respectfully considered. I can empathize with people from a religious community, I was one as a child, my own mother would rather die than give up her beliefs.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?   Again I agree with you on the rights of everyone to vote. I have no right to force my morality on anyone, I am not trying to do that. What I was trying to get across was the fact that not all is known and what is known is constantly being questioned, religious texts can be interpreted to anyones avail, and it is proved that they are massively edited, the problem comes when secular societies and religious communities clash.   Surely if no-one is being hurt then there should be no problem, if religious people believe it is wrong then they should consider the fact that a civil union is not a religious one, and therefore void in the eyes of their creator.   As for the fear that God destroys cities that permit homosexuality, I believe you are referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, did God not remove his faithful from these cities before destroying them and did he not pledge that he would  ""never again curse the ground on account of man""  after Noah's flood so there is nothing to fear.",1
52,"No comtradiction. let me rephrase waht you said so as to clear up the confusion;    Their lifestyle robs them of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.    If they want to do that fine. No one is saying homosexuals can't, they're free to form relationships, set up housekeeping and whatever their relationship demands.  What we are saying is if that's what you want to do fine, but don't ask us the American people to support you in that decision. Our Government was established to support Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Anything that works against those goals, like homosexuality, is well, against it and not in support of it. It's their choice that denies them these things, not the lack of our support of that choice. Or to put it another way, We are against it, homosexuality, because we want them to have these things, not because we want to deny it to them. Hence no contradiction  In regards the abolition of the things you mentioned. One of the purposes of government is to promote the common good. If those things aren't good for society then government shouldn't promote them and should in fact work to discourage them. Will people still do those things? you bet they will. But most people will respond to incentives and discouragements. If you make it easy more people will do it and if you make it hard less people will do it, it's really that simple. But some people are so thick headed that they love to do what they know is wrong. That's why we build prisons. Is it a perfect system? by no means. Is it the best in all of human history?

Don't recognize a person's right to tell you ""no."" If you stand there and argue with that person, then you have just recognized their right to tell you ""no"" and you are now trying to change their their mind to say ""yes"" so that they let you do whatever it is you want to do.   Basically what I'm saying is that the way gays have been going about fighting for their rights recognizes the opposition's right to say ""no.""  Now, I agree with and support this:  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.  I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on and they will therefore fight back. In other words, it legitimizes their right to oppose same sex marriage and gives them reason to fight back.  I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights. The federal government has way too much power.  Now, I did not say that gays are unreasonable for wanting same sex marriage. I am saying that if they are trying to follow scenarios one and two above, they are being unreasonable in the way they are pursuing it.   The argument that ""it doesn't affect any straight couple"" doesn't work because anyone could say, ""And? So what? Who cares? The majority has voted. They don't want it!""  The whole ""African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted"" doesn't work because the word marriage has a religious aspect to it that needs to be separated from the legal aspect. If it can't be removed, then another word needs to take its place.  You ask, ""What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?"" The answer is: Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so. By arguing the point you are admitting/recognizing their right to oppose you. If your stance is that they have no right to oppose you, then you need not argue the point; you just figure a way to navigate the system or go around the system.  Now, lets see how ridiculous you sound when you say that gays have never been able to find an ounce of happiness because they don't have a piece of paper that says that they are legally married. What a bunch of crap. Do you actually expect me to believe that a piece of paper is going to magically make them find happiness? Come on.  Gays have been living together, spending the rest of their lives together, loving each other, expressing their love for each other in front of friends and family for ages. If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again. Those people who hate gays will always hate gays regardless of this piece of paper you so desperately want.",0

144,"Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? Waht do you mran when you say ""homosexuals are not wrong""?   It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct. Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the ""truth.""   I thought it was clear when i stated that homosexuals are not wrong. What i meant was, in a simple perspective, that being a homosexual stops the advancement of human growth and advancement. This perspective is not being able to produce children.  The truth is contradicting. Evidence that supports the previous sentence is the fact that homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation. This is another perspective that makes being a homosexual naturally right. This evidence supports advancement of growth by controlling growth. That too sounds contradicting but if we overpopulated, then it may be hard to sustain life. If we can't sustain life, then we can't advance the growth of humans. Now, i am not too educated in all the problems that may happen due to overpopulation. However, i do think it is bad to use up most of earth's resources. We need earth's resources to sustain life.    Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you ""believe"" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   I understand what you are saying. However, you implied wrong. I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument:   1. Fearing the tip blade touching our heart because we don't want to die. (lol i said blame)?   2. We go to school to better ourselves.   3. Not wasting my life playing on my Nintendo Wii if i had a billion dollars.   I believe morality plays a part of evidence that supports the purpose of life (I can be wrong about this) :  1. Killing one or multiple people of your own race, human race, is wrong. Why do we hate or cringe our face at the thought of killing one of our own? I believe (but i think it is face on some levels) that it is wrong because killing your own kind is against the purpose of life.   However, this is contradictory. This is contradictory because we had World War 1 and World War 2. We kill our own kind in that race. However, i think that the truth can be contradictory. We had to fight in World War 1 and World War 2 to sustain America's advancement of growth.......I not to intelligent in history. However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us. Excuse me and correct me if I'm wrong.    How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?   hmmm. I stated this before in another person's comment but i believe i went off topic with my entire comment. When shadowwolf stated that men and women should fall in love, i took it as that men and women should be attracted to one another. That is why i went into the discussion of children and the purpose of life. I went into that discussion because the purpose of life is supported when men and women have children. If the author of this debate didn't imply ""producing children"" to ""married"" then my argument should be dismissed entirely due to the fact that i went off topic.   I'm not realizing this mistake.",0

25,"No, this doesn't porve the scenario wrong.   Why does it hsve to be only female homosexuals? I stated that it is mostly female homosexuals. The scenario is filled with mostly homosexuals because well:   1. That is my scenario and i created it.   2. It is going to prove WHY homosexuality is right.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------   By legal definition, there is a small gap between society and population. However, i am putting them in the same category because the gap is small. According to google definition, the term society means the aggregate of people living together in a small or less ordered community. If people wasn't in a society, hence society will not exist because  1. People create society.   2. The term people is in the definition of society.   You stated: ""According to the OED, ""society"" refers to the 'Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.'"" Without man, this association or society won't even exist. If man died, who is going to continue this association or companionship? Nobody would. Hence, no population means no society.   You stated: ""Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesivness and tolerance..."" First, that is a contradiction. You stated that a society is the association with one's fellow men. So how can it grow independently without man?   I am going give you a task. Build a house and don't allow no family to move in. Nobody is to ever live in that house after it is built. Is that house going to somehow, out of the blue, create family rules or laws? People create society. Society doesn't create itself.   You stated: ""It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow."" I agree that i can't say all societies have that desire. However, you see many times in history books the desire to be free, to work, to live, etc. Im not a historian with all the history classes i took, there were many times when mankind ""didn't want to stop."" They want to continue and grow through science, and technology. So i don't think it is a hasty generalisation. And when i stated ""conquer"" i didn't just mean violence. I also meant growth through science, technology, etc. That was my fault for not being specific.

Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals. I haven't read of any society that composed of mostly female homosexuals in history books. It is a thinking scenario. A ""what if"" scenario.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   And this about it, how can a society survive with mostly female homosexuals? No children is ever going to be produced. This is common sense. Yes, they can adopt children but im ignoring that. Why?

I can't prove morality but morality exists. And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   And im not saying that they are completely wrong and completely right.

137,"What people like you don't get is thay poeple who are legally married to a member of the same sex usually want to adopt. The child of the couple is going to be hurt mentally because it is healthy for a child to grow up in a household with one mom and one dad. The mom and the dad each contribute something to how the child acts and feels. Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt because they do not have that influence. I am not saying the child is mentally retarded, but it is much more healthy to have one mom and one dad. I sometimes will say that I support the right to marry but not to adopt.  My problem with that statement, though, is that the bible makes references where it says that a marrige is to be strictly between only one man and one woman.

66,"I agree with you that words evolve wtih timw as societies evolve.

Now, if some time in the future this picture comes up in my mind when I attend a gay wedding, then I don't even need a dictionary to tell me that a marriage is not just for straight people, the same way I didn't need a dictionary to tell me what a marriage is now.   Geriatrics marry young perky girls all the times, but don't ask me to accept that as a marriage. People do what they want and they're free to do  it  and I will not stop them, just don't ask me to accept that their idea of  it  is the same as my idea of  it .

Isn't it kind of ironical? I mean, so what if they're of the same sex? Aren't they entitled to love each other?  - No religious books (as far as I know) have ridiculed the whole notion of homosexuality. On the other hand, all of them have a common theme, that is, accepting people as they are, loving them as they are, and that everyone deserves to be happy.  - It has already been legalized in many countries.

6,"Hree is my argumemt and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)   If your thinking has changed, you're admitting that you are wrong, as I have shown. My thinking is iron clad and my position has not wavered throughout the debate. Your thinking on the other hand seems to be arbitrary. Thus, it seems like either you are too stupid to cling on to a position or that you have been proven wrong.   belief is knowledge if it is knowledge   Which obviously makes no sense as a statement  at all  since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true.   Wrong. It is an opinion that  has not been proven  to be true or false.   Knowledge is truth.   Wrong. Knowledge is  justified true belief . It is not merely that it is true. It is also justified. To be considered knowledge, a belief  must  fulfill three conditions:  1. The statement must be a statement of ""belief"".  2. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""  that is true .  3. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""   that has been proven   that  that is true .   Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.   Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"". Population growth exceeds ""the normal amount"" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there  is  overpopulation. Population growth  might lead to  overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation  immediately . Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I  know  that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.  Gosh, you don't seem to be too smart. Check the dictionary if you need to.   Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.   Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   Im not whining.   And yes, you are whining. You arguments aren't iron clad. In fact, it is a sieve with huge holes. More accurately, it is like a tower of cards that falls at the slightest challenge.   What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals?   Since you  claimed  that it is ""mostly female homosexuals"", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   It is a scenario. I created it.   Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a  FALSE ANALOGY  and you haven't disputed me.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.   I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.   Yes you have so my argument holds true.   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size.   I didn't say that. I said that population  growth  means blooming in size. Learn to read will you? What a prick.   When i say population, i simply mean people.   Which is ontologically wrong.   And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture.   Since you're an ignoramus, I didn't expect you to.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    DUH...    In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.   Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.

112,"Brfore I begin, the fololwing reminder is in order :  In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution   I suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.  The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.  My response:  Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.  If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.  We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual?   The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:  The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.   Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.    If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.    I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.)   Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.  One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.",0

Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word.

167,"Yes, you have rightly undersotod the conclusion of my recent argumebt with which you do not agree.   Next, you stated in the second paragraph,” Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in.”  My response:  The premise posits that the term parenthood has, ’many definitions’. It also, propositionally, establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term. (This is a non- discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion.) The introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term/s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion. And moreover, the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument. However, disregarding what your intent may or may not be, I will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree.  You stated:  When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   My response:  If what you claim is true then let’s test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle. The principle: When a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs, they no longer have rights to that which is theirs. (Lucidly stated for the debate)  A. A husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house.  B. A husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free; they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car.  C. A husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets.  All three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership. Albeit, a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person. For the thief presumes it is now his/her property for the taking.  All parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children, vehicles, houses, or pets. Let’s move on to the next statement.   You claimed:   Since this, (to raise or nurture), is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent.   My response:  Children of the age 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature; therefore they are possible targets to be parents. Individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria. Should they too be allowed to adopt? Pedophiles exactly meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt? The most hardened criminals meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt?  The ultimate conclusion, logically deduced from my arguments, is that no man, woman, or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with, including myself. No one in the world has a right to adopt. No institution in the world has a right to adopt. For if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person.  A homosexual has no right to adopt. However, the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling. No right is necessary. And the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority.  Therefore, no gay has a right to adopt. Which is the actual question of the debate.",0

Studies have been down that show a child of a heterosexual couple is no better off than a child of a homosexual couple.   Even if this were true, do you really think a child with no parents is better off than a child with two homosexual parents? Such arguments have been rendered moot, long ago. This is merely a rationalization for prejudice.",1

53,"Wwo!   Yiur right, I am not an authority. Just a parent as I am sure you either are or aspire to be judging by your passion..  That was an attempt to show that it was meant to be a light hearted poke at the wording.  But I am curious, why so intolerant? Why just jump right to the ""authority"" sarcasm?   Well, as long as we are at it, and as a non-authority...I disagree for the block! The differences go way deeper than trivial or cosmetic.  Women cannot pass masculinity to a male child. A boy cannot learn from a woman what it means to truly be a man just as two men cant teach a young woman what it means to become a real woman.     Two women cant do any better raising a boy to be a man than a single mother can, and we all know what that has done to entire generations of young men.   The damaging effects on children from the absence of a father in a family is well documented.   When it comes to the matter of masculinity its just not possible. Its not that its wrong...its just not possible.  Truly I am sorry. I didn't mean to step on toes. Just my non-authoritarian opinion.",0
127,"While I thnik that it could bring sbout a whole new class of social implications, I don't believe that any of them have the inherent ability to hurt anyone.   It's like the prohibition of marijuana on the bases that it's a ""gateway drug"". It may be true that people that are now on heroin have tried weed, it doesn't mean that it lead these people without control, to heroin. The same as saying people that do drive-by-shootings began their vehicular criminal life by driving to the mall, or at the DMV.    The theoretical implication to marriage between a man and man or a woman and a woman are the same as a man and woman. Then again, maybe you should be so bold as to ask a more correct question ""How can marriage, in general, hurt anyone"".",1
183,"Unmarried peolpe can adopt, at least in the UK and US, but foogle tells me it makes the process a little easier, so that's a good point that I hadn't considered.   oh sorry, I wasn't aware of that.  Where I come from you have to be married if you want to adopt, and you can't marry the same sex.   Depends. Two men kissing is fine but I wouldn't really want to see them getting up to their private business. With women, I'd be quite happy to watch that all day.  Even kissing does bother a lot of people though, and I see that as being their own fault. Unfortunately, the majority of voters seem to be in this category. And democracy is founded on the voters wishes.   I don't get what you're saying here, and I have no idea what difference it makes considering what you want to watch, and what you don't.  Are there men/women doing their buisness outside you're home? or in public? I don't see alot of that around here, but who knows.",1
159,"I want to ponit out a seldom talked about but nevertheless very important poiny:  Gay marriage absolutely does erode ""family"", and here is why: the church - the summation of all religious institutions - wants to control the relationship between children and parents. This is of utmost importance to the church, because parents are the most reliable tool of mass religious indoctrination; and because much of the ""sacred"" beliefs are delivered as interaction between parents and children, which the followers are supposed to model. This is why the church seeks to control both licensing to procreation (marriage) and procreation itself (promiscuity, abortions, gay marriage). Anyone who treads on these interests of the church is opposed by the church because losing any of these defense lines directly reduces the church's market which is never going to come back.   Gay marriage does exactly what the conservatives are complaining about: the necessity to allow gay people to marry means taking away the marriage prerogative from the church. It directly results in less believers and thus harms the religious thought as a whole.  Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing.",1

19,"The argument yhat ""epople may bully or harras the child"" is flawed. However how about the development stages of the child. Studies have shown that a child needs a mother and a father to develop..... both genders do have specific roles to play.

172,"Words are very powerful Jessald. Try walknig into a crowded toom and yelling fire, or walk through Watts, Los Angeles and yell out the ""n"" word.   Homosexuality is an act of gay sex, not gay love. Two men or women can love each other and not engage in gay sex. I have many male friends I have known for a long time that I love very deeply however I am not sexually attracted to them.   Men sexually attracted to other men and vice versa is a type of sexual disorientation. It happens all throughout the world in many different species however humans have the ability to correct behavior as apposed to the animal kingdom which is in some ways what makes us stand out. It can be the result of childhood or adult trauma, genetic hormonal imbalance's, environmental variables, the list is endless.   Forget throwing fuel on the fire, lets start researching the causes of homosexual behavior and find ways to treat the condition instead of pretending like its a matter of choice because to be honest, I dont know any Gay men who would choose to be gay in todays social climate.",0

""a and b above are the main elements to a marriage.""   The ""upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries"" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the  legal  sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate.  This debate is really about one question: Is homosexuality ok, or is it not? And if you leave religion out of the picture, as you should, the answer is inescapable: Yes, it's ok.",1

It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.",1
41,"It'a arbitrary becasue all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent.   Preference and the ability to consent aren't inclusive. That, for example, the age of consent might be lowered or raised has no bearing on the legal definition of consent.   The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences   The law has only broadened which  consenting parties  can be married, the issue of express consent would still need to be addressed if your slippery slope is to be accepted.   If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference?   As long as there are two expressly consenting parties, then nothing should stop us from allowing other people to get married. An animal can't consent. And despite your efforts below to show that your cat can, it's  you  who's saying it's consenting, not the cat itself. You can't consent on behalf of another unless that  legal  entity legally acquiesces to your authority to do so.   Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.   You're purposefully ignoring the issue of express consent to continue your argument, and it's simply becoming disingenuous at this point.",1

191,"The problem is that basing the neaning of a word on its hsitorical usage patterns leaves no room for evolution. When the legal definition of marriage was first established, it was, as you say, based on the views of society at the time.  But the views of society can change, and word meanings change along with them. And our laws should evolve to reflect these new meanings.  There was a time when black people didn't legally count as persons. Not too long ago you could've made the argument that the word ""man"" shouldn't include black men because generally when the word ""man"" was used, people thought of white men.  I still don't see what's so horrible about tweaking a legal definition.",1

By that logic we should get rid of marriage altogether, this way none of that can happen.  Just because an institution is old doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. Actually, the fact that it is so old is even more of a reason for it to change. Our thinking has advanced since then and our institutions should reflect that . Homosexuals aren't asking anyone to change their way of life...they just want the same rights that everyone else has: the right to marry who they love.
