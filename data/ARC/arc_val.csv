417,"I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator. Every time energy changes state, there is a loss: fuel to heat, heat to steam, steam to mechanical energy, mechanical to electrical, and in the car, electrical to battery, battery to mechanical, mechanical to tires, tires to motion. Add that to transmission losses, and you end up with a lot of waste instead of savings. Plug-in cars will add to the problem, not solve it.",1
472,"Part of the problem is the way this whole thing has been planned out. The state of California owns, and Amtrak operates, the Capitol Corridor between San Jose and Sacramento. Why couldn't the money be spent upgrading that line, building exclusive grade-separated and electrified tracks for HSR? That way, there would be true high-speed service on one of the busiest passenger rail corridors in the country and also a demonstrator line that could put to rest a lot of the disinformation spread by right-wing think tanks funded by the oil industry.",0

33,"Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets.",0
396,The government has a right to expect some measure of a return on the billions paid to institutions in the form of federal aid. Educators should be expected to be held accountable for some minimum degree of achievement from all the federal dollars they receive. Why throw good money into institutions that have a high dropout rate. We need to force these institutions to have 'some skin in the game' as this will force colleges to have a stake in a students outcome.,1
360,"Gillers' reasoning and the title of his piece don't compute: 'The Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges says that judges should not 'make speeches for a political candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office' or 'engage in any other political activity.'

Hmm, call me crazy, but Facebook shares some of the responsibility -- does it not? It's like refusing to assign blame to gun dealers and drug dealers. They increase accessibility to illicit materials, which essentially furthers the end goal of usage. Now, this isn't to suggest that Facebook is entirely at fault, but it does play an active role.",0
271,"Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.",1

673,"What a silly line of reasoning. We have to stop thinking about immigrants as people who simply take our stuff, as if there were a finite supply of 'jobs' piled up in a warehouse somewhere, the distribution of which is a zero-sum exercise. Immigrants are people and people are assets; they bring their creativity, energy, and culture to America for everyone's benefit. If that needs to be stated in terms one can measure with a dollar value, think of immigrants as sources of customer demand, stimulating employment. Immigrant-run restaurants and shops are a perfect example. Would native-born Americans be working at Chinese restaurants or Mexican bakeries if not for immigration? No, because those businesses wouldn't exist in the first place, and we'd all be worse off as a result. If those who call for America to exclude immigrants get their wish, the immigrants will benefit some other country, at which point these same pundits will predictably get their pants in a twist because 'Country X is beating us' in education, employment, creativity, etc.",1
563,"If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.",1
232,"The supposed inequalities are phony issues. Its not 1865 and the vast majority of African Americans have photo IDs, otherwise they would not be able to do ordinary activities like buy beer or cash a check. Its also dubious to claim that same day registration and early voting impact one group more than another. It was not all that long ago when there was no early voting or absentee ballots, you had to show up on that day in November. Those are minor issues about convenience and reflect the soft nature of our modern society where people simply can't be inconvenienced by having to show up to vote on a certain day. I've used absentee ballots and appreciated the convenience, but its a minor thing and has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.",0

185,"This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.",0
97,"Legal immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is the issue. Arguing that legal immigration and illegal immigration together sometimes produce positive results is irrational. We can have legal immigration without illegal immigration.

Having foreign and out of state students paying full tuition seems like a good response, but it becomes a chicken and egg situation: which caused the other? What has caused the administration outnumber or nearly outnumber teaching staff? I especially am unhappy with large increases in foreign students because they can use the state-side degree to help short-cut visa rules: foreign students are effectively paying tuition as a penalty or fee to get access visa ahead of less wealthy applicants.

Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip.

It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.",0

It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted.

I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain.

And no, we don't look like grizzlies, but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and 'digest the raw innards' just fine. Please don't base your argument on 'the logic of the animal kingdom' when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution. You're a chef, so you presumably know a lot about food.

The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession.

I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near.

It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction.

Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).",1

Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.",0

My advice to you is to limit your exposure to Fox News, quit watching reruns of 24 and Homeland, and think about what Jesus would do.

Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades.

Her frank acknowledgment of her own mortality and that of her fellow Justices is almost a sad metaphor for the rule of law in this country should Trump come to power (i.e., its days are numbered).

The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers.

The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence.

In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors.

A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration?

Too many of the students vote for what they think sounds cool. They don't think about or care about the consequences. It's easy to vote for a new tax or bond when you aren't the ones paying for it.

136,">> 'Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children.' That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means.",0

I went back to the rescue ladies who were strong animal advocates and they were supportive of my desire to declaw. So, it was done. My cat and I had ten great years together and her inability to scratch me when holding her or playing with her endeared her to me all the more.

It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession. But the no-tipping system does remove considerable uncertainty as to whom and how much to tip, which I think is a source of resentment for some people.",1

On occasion, I've attempted to read comments on other news sites and find that many of them contain back and forth banter for lack of a better word between two people with little input from others. This gets old rather quickly. I choose to read the intelligent and well thought out comments both from the left and right. I do lean more to those comments that lean more to the left. I subscribe to the paper but do check out the editorials and opinion pieces on line just to see what some of my favorite commenters have to say.",0

As long as I can remember, this elite liberal arts college in Oregon has advertised its non-participation in intercollegiate athletics, offering only intramural sports.

Make sports part of the community, as is done in places such as Germany.",0

What every curriculum needs is more discussion of Thomas Jefferson's love life, for instance, or alternative theories of how Warren Harding met his maker (some say his wife had just had enough). Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' they must refer to it as 'Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin,' because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list.

We know, for example, that anabolic steroids make people more muscular and larger. They are also associated with more aggressive behavior.

The drug user is often risking the safety of those around him.",0
644,"While many science and technology workers around the world speak English, certainly not all of them do. There are software companies and engineering firms all over the world where having Americans who speak these languages -- along with being able to communicate in the cultural context in which these languages exist -- is an advantage, or even a requirement to do business. Berlitz doesn't teach how to communicate engineering concepts in German, or how to sell email marketing in France, or how to gain competitive advantage in Hong Kong by knowing the language and culture. While some do feel that we should be turning out nothing but professional vocational degrees from colleges and universities, I would like to point out that my colleagues in science and technology are often terrible at communication -- language, context and culture (including American English) -- unless they study it.",0

During the American occupation of Iraq, Assad sent thousands of Jihadis to kill US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. These Jihadis were responsible for the worst atrocities of the Iraq war. Only last year, Assad's chief Mufti threatened Europe with 'suicide bombers'. His father Hafez was responsible for the killing of 241 US marines in a suicide attack on their barracks in Lebanon.

For that $40k I get up in the morning, drive to the office and work hard for eight hours every day. For that $10k in capital gains all I do is spend thirty seconds a month transferring money from my checking account to my mutual fund accounts. In my opinion it's offensive to tax money that rolls in with almost no effort at a lower rate than money you have to earn by hard work. Don't tell me that the rich work hard for their capital gains. I know how hard I work for mine and the answer is thirty seconds per month. Tax the lazy.",1
269,"When Dupont refers to 'research,' I assume he's referring to his linked report, 'Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,' and to Figure 7.10 in that report, the pie chart labeled '20.2 million needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use,' which says that 95.5% said that they 'Did not feel they needed treatment.' Among the problems with that chart is (1) they don't tell how they defined 'needing' or determined who 'needed' it (2) they they include marijuana in the category of 'illicit drug.' The bulk of those 20.2 million could be marijuana users. Even with heroin, amphetamines and cocaine, you can't just assume that because somebody is using that drug, he or she is abusing it or 'needs' treatment. Many people function well even while using those drugs. For example, Ayn Rand used amphetamines. Allen Ginsberg used amphetamines. You could spend a whole semester course reading books that had been written on amphetamines. Should they have been forced into treatment?",0
473,"The English language can be very precise when the correct words are being used. After reading this work of David Dyssegaard Kallick I am confused over the repeated use of the word immigrant. Does he mean a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence of which the US government allows over one million per year or is he referring to those who have entered or remained in the US in violation of law? By the very unlawful nature of their entry or stay we can have no precise number of how many are already here. Unemployment in the US amongst its citizens and lawful immigrants, especially those working in the trades or service industries, is high, too high. An influx of uncounted numbers of unskilled foreign workers illegally here cannot help reduce that number.",1

678,The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past.,0
676,"I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day.",0
180,"Gaps in European military spending for what threat? Terrorism, by and large, is a law enforcement and intelligence agency problem. It's been used by those who didn't know what to focus on after the end of the cold war as an excuse to continue to play the same old games they were familiar with from the cold war. The USA can no longer afford to p,at the role of world policeman, and Europe - which faces no credible threat of military invasion-can and should provide for its own military needs. The cold war mentality got the USA into too many problems it should never have gotten into - Korea, Vietnam, desert storm, and the two Bush wars. We should disband NATO and while we are at it ask ourselves why are we defending south Korea and Japan? Like Europe these are two rich nations that could defend themselves. Besides the endless waste of money, would anyone reading this think the lives of their son or daughter is worth defending south Korea? It's not 1950 anymore.

Acceptance of court rulings is undermined if the public believes that judicial decisions are politically motivated'. That boat left the port a long time ago. Certainly after Gore v Bush.

Acceptance of court rulings [as if they were above politics] is undermined if [we acknowledge the truth of the proposition that] the public believes that judicial decisions are politically motivated'.",0

I support due process, but then why do teachers in NY who have compromised their responsibilities sit in rubber rooms all day? Why do administrators and school boards say the only way to let go of a teacher is if they harm a student or break the law? Administrators quite frankly do not do their jobs well.

The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, 'You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it.'
