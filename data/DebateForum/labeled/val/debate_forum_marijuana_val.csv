"I agree with you until your getting high poses a threat to others.  For instance, I think it's okay to take drugs in the privacy in your own home without an intent to hurt anyone else.  However, if you were home with your family, got high, and began to do dangerous things or hurt your family because of your getting high - that's not okay.  As long as the only 'victim' - if there even is one - is yourself, I don't think anyone should really have a say in what you do.",1
Did you forget to say you do it on weed?  Did you forget because of weed?  Do you have any weed?,1

"What evidence do you have to support the statement ""Weed is a bad substance, just as bad as alcohol""?

"While you've presented some valid arguments, if this topic really upsets you that much, the best course of action on your part would probably be to ignore it. This would help your peace of mind and would avoid conflict with those who vote you down for being off topic.  This is a site where everybody can create a debate about anything, inevitably someone will create a debate about some topic you really can't hear about it anymore. I've encountered some of those myself. However, the people that choose to participate in the debate have every right to do so, that's what this site has been created for. If, instead of just ignoring those debates, people would constantly jump in to complain about how they can't hear about it anymore, that would strongly deteriorate the quality of the debates. Looking at your first couple of posts, they did not add anything to the debate, only later did you write a good argument.  Yes there are more important topics to discuss, does that mean that people should only discuss those topics? No, everybody is free to discuss what they feel like. Some people feel strongly about this topic and some people are out there actively campaigning for legalization. If you count yourself among those that have made up their mind, and don't feel like discussing it anymore, then the best thing to do is probably to just scroll right past the debate.  Lastly I would like to add that what I just said applies to a range of comments on various debates. I decided to specifically comment on your arguments, because it seems to me that you're actually interested in conducting quality debates.",1
"What is your problem with the Herb anyway   The way it effects the brain and mental system.   you agree it is better than a lot of what is Legal already   No, I agreed that in  some  cases there are drugs that have more severe effects (ultimately it depends on the amount consumed and the at the frequency it is consumed).   why should it be illegal for someone who wants to get to get stoned on Marijuana to unwind but OK for them to get drunk which has a lot more health issues connected   Moderation. Marijuana has more of an addiction effect than alcohol does.",1
You can brew your own beer at home... but Im pretty sure the alcohol industry is doin alright,1
But you also have to consider that continuous usage of LSD can cause severe mental illnesses in people. There hasn't ever been a case of this happening from using marijuana.,1

"Marijuana is a drug that can lead to other drugs. Not for everyone, but it does afford everyone the opportunity to find other drugs. Legalized marijuana would continue the downfall of our society in the United States. There are many people who don't smoke pot because it is illegal. These same people would totally deplete the nations supply of potato chips and ice cream. Madness.",0
"Marijuana seems to be opposed purely on an indoctrinational basis.   Because it is relatively harmless, because it does not cause hysteria or murder or other horrible effects, the only reason sane people would so strongly desire to outlaw a plant is because they were taught from an early age that this plant is horrible and illegal.  Nearly everyone opposed to it has never tried it more than once. It is well known that not everyone feels the effects of it the first time, so when they say ""It doesn't work"", and they continue to agree with the government, it only hurts people who do enjoy using it.  If it was harmful, then why do so many intelligent people use it? The founding fathers grew it, and everyone knows about Carl Sagan.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.   And even if it was harmful, how can anyone tell me what I can and can't put into my own body? If I was a child, I would understand, but I think I can research this stuff on my own well enough to understand what marijuana is and then consume it without guidance.  If the government wants to interfere in my life, then I would like a massive research grant so I can do science and hopefully improve the world for everyone.",1
"No, I've had first hand experience of what it's like to be around people smoking marijuana. It's a bad pungent odor that can be smelled several yards away. I mean when you can smell someone smoking marijuana from down the street, it's a social issue. In time even the smell gives me a bad headache. Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern. I know, I know, Marijuana only alters the mind and it has no harmful fumes, yeah, well, wait until it goes public and it's everywhere, I think we'll find, as we do with almost everything, it's not what we assumed it would be. We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol. Some of us are while many others of us are not, and really, to legalize marijuana would mean a whole new era of legislation to control everyone that would not regard others in their use of the substance. At least now, they have to regard others or risk having the police called on them.",0

"It should be legalized. We need to strive for a rational legal code. In relation to tobacco and alcohol, two of the legal drugs, cannabis is hands down the least harmful. It does not have the physically addictive properties of either alcohol or tobacco, cannabis users can stop anytime with withdrawal symptoms on par with or less than that of caffeine withdrawal. More than that, tens of thousands of people die every year from lung cancer and alcohol related accidents and illnesses. If your an alcoholic you can die if you just stop drinking. No one to my knowledge has ever been killed from smoking or quiting cannabis. In addition, cannabis has not been shown to have the carcinogenic effects that tobacco has. Cannabis has even been shown to promote new brain cell development, and its users report wide ranging benefits. The Netherlands model shows that soft drugs can be legalized and it actually improves the society. We need to end the propaganda and misinformation campaign, bring more reason and fairness to our legal code, and legalize cannabis.",1
"Ya i agree with the sentiment, legalize. I can understand why you would want to have some control over distribution, keep it away from kids. But i don't know what a public store is.

"My Spring semester of my freshman year in college was when I discovered weed. This semester I pulled 3 A's and a B, successfully worked out five days a week despite ""the munchies"" and held a steady job. I was not late for class or the job, and thus disproved that pot smokers are unproductive members of society. At my peak I was smoking once every day. Statistics also show that no one has died as a result of weed, nor gotten addicted, nor gotten a ""hangover"" the morning after, and alcohol has led me to do more things I regretted, disproving that weed is the true ""gateway"" drug. Weed has also been scientifically proven to NOT directly cause lung cancer as cigarettes do, and if legalized, the revenue will soar sky high. Legalize it!",1
"We should stop trying to stop the pot heads.  I hate drugs too because they are unhealthy & deadly but I don't think the government should be arresting people for doing them.  I think drugs including tobacco & alcohol should be banned from public stores.  It shouldn't be illegal. If it is illegal where you arrest anybody who does pot then that just causes more problems.  So here is the answer: legalize pot & other illegal drugs but ban them, tobacco & alcohol from public stores.",1
The health effects are way too severe.   You're a funny guy.,0
"I hate Marijuana.  But it should be legal. Just like alcohol and tobacco and fast food etc. (things that are bad for you that I also don't like, accept fast food (; )are legal.

Weed used to be the US's largest crop. I've heard speculation that the founding fathers smoked it. Certainly seems like our country's been awfully fucked up since it was illegalized.,1
"Yes, I find it interesting that everything you've said are things that I agree with, and I find it interesting that I've done a LOT of research on it, yet before I did the research, my opinion was the same as the guy you're disputing.  It is interesting how a lack of knowledge about a topic requiring knowledge, rather than keeping people away, actually draws people in.  If you are not interested in smoking the reefer, then don't smoke it. If you do not enjoy greek plays, then do not learn greek and do not go to greek plays with your uninformed and antagonistic opinion.  I, however love greek plays and even though greek plays do upset some people, there are much worse problems in the world.  For one, why does the government outlaw a plant, but it doesn't outlaw war?

"All that Marijuana is doing is making people less intelligent, less concerned about life, less concerned about school, etc. It is just going to bring a revolution of persons who do not give a bit of care for succeeding in life.

Any evidence that it  wouldn't  cause an increase? Come on, it IS common sense, which is almost worthless in a debate so it's not really fare is it?    Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk.   How dangerous did you think I thought it was? I wasn't saying it was equal. Just that we shouldn't add to a problem.    I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.   What failure? Like I said. I don't think that driving high and drunk are the same. But they are both bad. And will happen more if weed id legalized.     But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.   Well there's that common sense again. Some people are stupid. It should be illegal to drive if you are going on 3 days of no sleep. But thats hard to enforce. Laws against driving  high  on the other hand, is not as tricky to enforce.    Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.   Calm down.",0

"Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.",1
"There is no valid comparison to be drawn between cocaine and marijuana. Marijuana is not addictive, it doesn't cause cancer, you cannot overdose on it, and it doesn't make you any more likely to commit other crimes.   The only way it could be dangerous is if you drive under it's influence. Which is no different than most any prescription drug.  I've not seen a single convincing argument for why Marijuana should be illegal.",1
"You misunderstand, I was telling the first guy that said people shouldn't smoke pot that he was being hypocritical.",0
"The reasons for why pot should be legalized are all legitamite but people are only looking at the big picture. Sure it can benifet society in many ways but their are so many down sides to legalizing pot. If everyone were to become pot attics they would become more and more addicting up to the point that all they want to do is smoke pot. Allot of people are probably reading this and thinking that i am completly wrong, but the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high. With that said, how will our society progress if every has their minds on obtaining pot. Our world will not become more advanced because everyone who was one smart is now a pot head! Who will be the guy to cure cancer if everyone is on pot??",0
"It sounds like you are against second hand buzz. That's fine with me. It should be legalized, that way people don't have to go behind the law to do it, which brings up all kinds of problems. So, ya i agree.",1

"What's bad about marijuana is that you have to burn it in order to get the best high. The burning part is what causes health problems less in danger than smoking tobacco.  Marijuana is totally healthy and science proved that the old crap used to be told on TV and newspaper is just not true. It does not produce violence (exactly the opposite), it does not kill brain cells at all, and it does not make you insane.",1
"This pothead hippy can spell welfare and wipe (and form complete sentences!). That would make me more educated than you, nay?",1
"Although I consider myself liberal, this is one issue that I strongly oppose! Marijuana, like tobacco, causes cancer as it contains carcinogens. Marijuana is also highly addictive. The tetrahydrocannabinol in it is what causes the addiction which make people crave it. Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine. If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence. Yes, marijuana is not the only drug that cartels produce and sell, but it is one of them. The only form it should be legal in is a medical form but should be used with intense care.",0
"""I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions""   Once again you have nothing but speculation to back that up. This didn't happen with prohibition of alcohol and it didn't happen when Amsterdam legalized marijuana and it didn't happen when Portugal decriminalized all drugs.   ""don't say it's not addicting. I know people that are addicted""   I will say it isn't addictive because it is not physically addictive. I don't care how much anecdotal evidence you have, it has been proven to not be physically addictive. While cigarettes and alcohol are incredibly addictive, yet you seem to be okay with them.   ""Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America.""   You are completely making that proportion up. It is based on absolutely no evidence. You would be just a justified if you literally picked a random number because that is basically what you did.  And what havoc do you think people wreak on America that do it now. Once again as you failed to acknowledge marijuana does not cause reckless and uncontrollable actions like alcohol does. Yet once again I doubt you support the prohibition of alcohol.   ""Productivity would go down""   And again another statement based totally on social stigma and no actual evidence.  I challenge you to cite one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes that you actually have a shred of evidence. I really don't think you can come up with a single one. If you can, prove me wrong. Once again it cannot also apply to alcohol or cigarettes and must be have evidence. Don't speculate or provide anecdotal evidence.",1
"yes, for one simple reason.   free country. if people wanna fuck up their lives with drugs, let them. hell, maybe they won't die or lose their job. the point is, not our fuckin' business on how someone decides to take the edge off.  making drugs an illegal business just gets more people killed anyway. imagine what would happen to the drug lords if corporations took over the drug market.  basically: ""got a problem? fix it with capitalism""",1
"I totally agree. In addition to this argument, marijuana should be legal for many reasons. It would be financially beneficial for farmers to grow marijuana in their fields in the U.S. Instead of relying on prescription drugs, marijuana helps with medical conditions concerning: Glaucoma, arthritis, cancer, pain, nausea, AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain Injury/Stroke, Anti-Tumor Effects, Asthma, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Migraine, and eating disorders. It also helps with increased intelligence and focused attention. Marijuana should have been legalized when alcohol was legalized.",1
"Actually, I'm not a stoner. I don't like the stuff, tried it once when I was 18, had a bad reaction, and I've never tried it again. However, that doesn't stop me from seeing that it has huge economic benefits. Plus I've seen its benefits on a friend of mine who has scoliosis. Muscle relaxants do very little for him and they have bad side effects, whereas pot helps him to function and leaves him relatively pain free.",1
"Unless I am mistaken, lots of people are already using it, I don't think legalizing it would increase use by any significant margin, it would simply be more visible. The type of people who smoke marijuana are not the type of people who obey laws for the sake of obeying laws.",0

"I a little bit disagree with you, because as I think everything in this world can compare with something, I mean that any thing in comparison with others can be better or worse, and it always will be, so I want to say in comparison with tabacoo marijuana is more harmful, but accordinh to the same The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) alcohol drinks has bigger danger for health than marijuana.",1
"When it comes to my point of view on the legalization of Marijuana I believe that there is no reason what so ever for it to remain illegal.  I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",1

"I do not support a ban on Alcohol. Nor Do I support a ban on Marijuana. In fact, I have not spent one single moment of my time here saying that it should remain illegal. All I am saying is that it does alter one's state of mind which can lead to crime just as alcohol can, whether it's addictive or not. We need to be prepared for the ramifications of legalizing Marianna if/when it happens.    If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   That's not the same logic. Ideally, marijuana use would be legal, driving would be legal, and they would never happen at the same time. But suppose it does, and someone mows down a pedestrian at a crosswalk and gets charged with manslaughter. In that case, marijuana use would be a contributor to the crime, but not illegal in itself, much like alcohol is now.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.   I agree. But just like alcohol, people will still use it and drive. Especially if it's made legal. Again, I don't advocate it remaining illegal based on that principal, but we must be ready to deal with more high drivers, because that's probably what will happen.",1
"Dude wtf are you talking about, its fun because its fun! If it were legal it would be awesome because almost nobody would experience paranoia or anxiety when high, because it would be legal!",1
"Yes, marijuana is actually less harmful than alcohol, yet we didn't learn our lesson after ending prohibition. Marijuana should never have been made illegal in the first place.",1
"Yes, because then mandatory sentencing would be stopped, and young lives could be saved from insane jail sentences.",1
My apologizes.,0
And don't forget so many lives ruined with excessive mandatory sentencing of jail times.,1
"But only in Tijuana. Just in case it isn't a good idea. That way I can just go across the border, have some fun and go home. Mexico can suffer any negative effects due to the legalization of marijuana.",1
"So let me get this straight...you're for the side that wants to keep the war on drugs to include cannabis, but then made an argument that cannabis legalization wouldn't affect the war on drugs? If so, then your missing the point: the war on drugs doesn't have to include marijuana. That's why we're debating.",1
"Yes. Pot is much safer than alcohol and tobacco, and far less addictive than many legal drugs (including coffee!)  Pot is also a better substance to take in a social context: alcohol can make people aggressive and even violent, whereas pot relaxes you.",1
Exactly. Hemp can be used for much more too. Smarrrrrt stoner =],1
Yes because it is a plant not a drug but if you set it on fire there are sidefects.,1
"In reality, Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol, however, Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug into crack cocaine, heroin, opium, etc. It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed. When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",0
"Again, the drug use in Amsterdam is lower than it is here. Given your argument, how do you explain this?  References:  http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/67",1
yes because native Americans used it as a medicine in the days.   Amsterdam you can smoke pot there why not Australia?,1
"I think marijuana should be legalized for various reasons.   First of all, let me make it clear that I currently do not consume marijuana. I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people. Like tobacco, it could be heavily taxed and provide more money for the Federal Reserve (I'm not sure that is a good thing).  So, there's my argument. Anyone beg to differ?",1
"I truly agree with you that it's no more harmful than tobacco and alcohol , There are many disadvantages from both and in my opinion i wouldn't legalize both of them in our state. According to the scientist David Geffen cigarette smokers may feel that their tobacco addiction is far less harmful than smoking an illegal drug such as marijuana. Marijuana smokers who abstain from tobacco sometimes boast that their drug of choice is safer than cigarettes. The truth is that both tobacco and marijuana have damaging effects. Those who smoke both cigarettes and marijuana suffer the compound consequences of two different drugs destroying their health simultaneously.That's why advice to all smokers don't smoke because you can die early",0
"one major point:  canada- they have legalized pot, and more guns, and lower murder rate. bc all those guns are chill.",1
"I don't think legalizing pot would be an end to the war and damn the day I see the war on drugs end. Drug abuse kills people all the time, screws them up, messes with their faces, gets people killed, infests the country with greed. Why the hell should we let that run rampant?  I have my dictator's hat on tonight. :D!",0
"Furthermore, let's imagine ourselves in the place of parents, father or mother whose child was caught with marijuana in police. According to laws of many countries, this is a crime and it will be appearing in the personal file of person all his life. Imagine yourself, it's like a spot for the whole lifetime. Because of this, many young people break their lives, bacause once they took a drug and the police caught them. I think it's a little bit cruel and unfair. As a rule, in future these people will have some problems with work, with the opossite sex and so on, and all because they probably once in his life took a drug. Therefore, if government legalize marijuana it will give a real chance for a happy life of many young people all around the world.",1
well if you knew what you were talking about and had facts to back up your argument then you wouldnt get downvoted... You cant debate with emotions buddy,1
"Debaters debate the two wars as if Nixon’s civil war on Woodstock Nation did not yet run amok. The persecution of the half-a-million strong hippies assembled in August 1969 can’t be good for America, the world-leader in percentile behind bars. Madam Secretary Clinton need not travel to Tibet to find a minority subculture stripped of human rights. If we are all about spreading liberty abroad, then why mix the message at home? Peace on the home front would enhance credibility.   Stop throwing good money after bad. The witch-hunt doctor’s Rx is for every bust to numerate a bigger tax-load over a smaller denominator of payers. Spend more on prisons than on schools. My shaman’s second opinion is homegrown herbal remedy. Consumer dollars can stimulate the economy better if they aren’t depleted by prohibition’s black market.  Only a clause about interstate commerce provides a shred of constitutionality. The commerce policy on the number-one cash crop in the land is no taxation; yes eradication. But money to frustrate enforcement grows on trees. Did the authors of the Constitution intend to divert the Treasury’s natural revenue to Mexican cartels? America rejected prohibition, but its back. Swat teams don’t seem to need no stinking amendment.  The demonized substances never had their day in court. Nixon promised to supply supporting evidence later. Later, the Commission evidence didn’t support, but no matter. The witch-hunt was on. No amendments can assure due-process under an anti-science law that never had any due-process itself. Science hailed LSD as a drug with breakthrough potential, until the CSA (Controlled Substances Act of 1970) halted all research. Marijuana has no medical use, period. Lives are flushed down expensive tubes.  The RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993) allows Native American Church members to eat peyote. A specific church membership should not be prerequisite for Americans to obtain their birthright freedom of religion. Denial of entheogen sacrament to any American, for mediation of communion twixt the soul and the source of souls, violates the First Amendment.  Freedom of speech presupposes freedom of thought. The Constitution doesn’t enumerate any governmental power to embargo diverse states of mind. How and when did government usurp this power to coerce conformity? Legislators who would limit cognitive liberty lack jurisdiction.  Common Law must hold that the people are the legal owners of their own bodies. Socrates says, know your self. Mortal law should not presume to thwart the intelligent design that molecular keys unlock spiritual doors. Those who appreciate their own free choice of personal path in life should not deny self-exploration to seekers. The right to the pursuit of happiness is supposed to be inalienable by government.  Simple majorities in each house could put repeal of the CSA on the president’s desk. The books have ample law on them without the CSA. Americans are already liable for damages when they screw-up. The usual caveats remain in effect. Strong medicine requires prescription. Employees can be fired for poor job performance. No harm, no foul; and no excuse, either. Replace the war on drugs with a frugal, constitutional, science-based drugs policy.",1
"That's just simply ignorant. Do a bit of research and prove to me what your saying is true. Like most things in this world, it's really not that black and white.  Since you haven't shown me any evidence to support your statements, I'll show you a list of 'drug users' you may not have known existed:   http://www.friendsofcannabis.com/ directory/ index.php?option=com_ alphacontent&Itemid;=58     http://www.veryimportantpotheads.com/",0
"It has: smoking cigarettes has a much more harmful effect, statistically then smoking pot. And yeah, there are many, many ways to consume cannabis. You can smoke it, vape it, eat it, and spray it. The last 3 have 0 harmful side effects.",1
"Where is the hard data that backs your claims of #1, 2, & 3. People cite your reasons as a strong arguement for keeping marijuana legal, but there is flaws in that.  #1 - There is no data that specifically proves that marijuana causes people to experiment with harder drugs. This argument is subjective to individual experince; therefore it cannot be used to support the prohibition of marijuana because there is more smokers who have not tried harder drugs than there is smokers who have. #2 - This claim never existed until after 9-11 happened and governmental scare tactics used on the population to further it's own agenda. If anyone knows drugs and their nature, they'd know that marijuana money is chump change to harder, more expensive drugs. If a terrorist organization were to make money from the export of illegal drugs, they are more likely to sell cocaine, heroin, and/or MDMA (Ecstasy). Therefore, the likeliness of marijuana being a major source of income for terrorist organizations is very low. #3 - Is connected to #1 and therefore, is invalid.",1
"to make everything legal would be for the best. making alcohol illegal would raise our countries debt up even higher, and the War on Drugs has raised our debt up to where we can't get rid of it.",0
"Weed is only laced when a joint is rolled and the user wishes to combine the drugs.    It is not combined with other drugs while still on the bud (as it is sold) because this would cost the dealer extra. Weed may be sprayed with silicone or other substances to cause it to weigh more. However, this practice would surely be eliminated if it were legalised and properly regulated.",1
yes it whould be legalized beacause ive grown up around people who have smoked pot or are smoking pot and it never made them hullucinate or slow down there motor functions in fact its actully help a few of them. besides why is it the hospitals can give it out to people with cancer when ever one else gets arrested just because they have a few tumors that gives them the right to bypass the law that every one has to obay.,1
"Not really, but MDMA can if we can apply it properly to the entire populace... or, at least, our world leaders.",0
And it'd be taxable .,1
Comparing marijuana to meth is stupid.,1
Why ban something so innocuous?,1
