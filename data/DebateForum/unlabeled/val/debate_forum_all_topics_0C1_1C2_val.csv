"This gets murky, because each person differs in DNA. Then at what point does something stop being animal and start being human? We currently investigate how animals reason and communicate in order to determine their degree of 'humanness' for want of a better word. By your definition, we should give a chimp 98.6% of human rights. Why shouldn't we judge a person's worth by their skills and aptitude, indeed, that is how modern society judges a person's value, their salary and place in society is largely determined by how well they predict and manage obstacles. And to an extent, we do shun those who are incapable. That is how our Laissez Fair paradigm works.",1,1

"I'm attacking your illogical mind and your silly arguments! If that's a personal attack, then I guess that's what it is!  Ok so you're not calling for abortion to be outlawed, why then are you arguing for their side? You should argue for our side or at the very least choose the ""it depends"" option! I know you want to educate (as do I), so educate, and if that works out well in the future you won't find it necessary to ban abortion!  I'm not defending anybody with my outrageous suggestions. It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. It has more educational value then a ban on abortion. Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child. Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?  The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work. It doesn't work to educate, it simply makes it ... what did you call it? ah yes... ""the next underground drug"".",1,1

"Explain to me why it is obvious.    It was obvious because 1) That's the way the term is most often used in US political discussions 2) Conservatives have made it clear that they will object to anything and everything Obama does or attempts to do. It therefore follows that they will call his policies disastrous regardless of reality. 3) Conservatives are obviously not always entirely irrational. The italics hinted that I was half-joking, that I was taking a dig at the opposition.   If you would have used the term ‘conservative’ I would have supposed you were referencing republicans exclusively. Yet, the term you used is ‘conservative ideologues’. And while you may argue that republicans are conservative ideologues I would also argue that republicans are not the only conservative ideologues. For I personally know many democrats who are conservative ideologues.    I could submit thirty failed predictions of thirty economists of the past ten years.    This statements reflects a lack of understanding of the fallability of anecdotal evidence. You can't just go outside and pick out thirty white stones and thereby assert that all stones are white. However, a random sampling of essays in a major economics journal might do the trick.   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  The following is an  illustration  of the very reason why I asked you to qualify what you call extraordinary evidence:  You affirm that there are no stones that are white. I affirm that there are stones that are white. You assert that my assertion is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. I in turn request the number of stones that you require as evidence that there are stones that are white. And you reply that my evidence is anecdotal if I present the evidence of white stones.  Remember, I am seeking to satisfy your request to provide the necessary evidence that brings into question the prudence of relying upon the consensus opinion of mainstream economists. I am not attempting to prove that the consensus opinion of mainstream economists is true or false in the future. You must realize that I am attempting to demonstrate the fact that when a group of individuals has consistently misled our expectations we must realize that we have been misguided. And unless we want to be misguided in the future I recommend that we consider the track record of those who guide our expectations. Not that they may be right or wrong in the future, its just a matter of whether or not we are willing to follow the same course.   I’ll address your other statements after we settle this latest disconnect.   (You have assumed that I am attempting to draw an invalid inference.)",1,0

"In today's society people discriminate against homosexuals all the time. In the classroom, at people's offices, in people's own families. Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.  You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights.   People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.  As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they  had to base their decision on facts . When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.  So now, tallblondebigotedguy,  what are your reasons ? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage? I swear that I am listening to your reasons now. Don't hide behind false pretenses of discrimination, or that people don't respect your views, because until you can give me your reasoning, all of that is irrelevant.",1,1

"You fail to show what marijuana supposedly ""does to people"". There are few ill effects, even among the heaviest long-term smokers. But heavy, long-term repetition of most activities will have negative results (running, for example).  You also appear to be claiming that marijuana use is somehow a threat to domestic peace. You also seem to think it will magically develop addictive properties once its legal.  You fail to show why the law should be invasive enough to regulate what you put in your own body, or why the law should be used to legislate away things you don't like. Governments allow industry to put all kinds of toxins and waste into our food, air, and water, and the government gets paid to allow it, and all the citizens are forced to ingest it. No reason we shouldn't all have the right to knowingly poison ourselves.  Also, your argument seems to assume that many people would suddenly begin using marijuana who are not already, and there's no data to prove this. People are already spending their pot budgets, nothing would change there (except maybe they could grow it and save).  Your entire view of government is rather disturbing. ""The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace."" Citizen-control is  not  a constitutional principle, in fact our rights insulate us from overt control by the government.",0,1
"Well, segregation is kind of a bad word   There's nothing bad about it.   Marriage is in most places, defined as a man and a woman. So the best thing to do is create civil unions. It's really simple actually.   An implication of Brown vs the Board of Education, and subsequent integration laws, permitted precedent for Lovings vs Virginia as an addendum to Brown, amending the definition of marriage, institutionally, to include interracial coupling, as a matter of civil rights. Your point, as simple as it is, holds no weight. Lovings vs Virginia effectively trumps you.   Why does a different name make something un-equal?   You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal. If people are on equal ground, then segregating their practices and institutions contradicts that equity. If they are equal, then there's no reason at all to segregate.",1,1
"Then if you're different pick a different word. Traditionally marriage has meant a union between a man and a woman. To use the same word for same sex partners dilutes the word and makes it less descriptive.

Let us see you as different and accept you for what you are. There's no need to put a requirement forcing us to see you as the same.  BTW, claiming that gays are genetetically different and supporting genetic engeneering means that someday some one will want to eradicate the gay gene. It's a two edge sword that cuts both ways.

That's a pretty bold statement to make for everyone that's had any ailment (which there are many: migraines, insomnia, post traumatic stress disorder, PMS, etc.) that pot could help, don't you think? Where's the evidence to back this up?  Pot is not physically addicting. However, caffeine, is addictive. Whether or not something is or isn't addictive shouldn't be the only criteria for determining it's safety within society. If it were, then all pain killers would be illegal in addition to coffee and tea and probably television.",0,1

"“Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.”  U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C., September 9, 2009.   This links to  an article  about federal funding going to Maryland and Pennsylvania's high risk insurance pools.   This requires knowledge of 2 things -   First, an understanding of a property of money - fungibility.  To illuminate: if a woman gets federal money, e.g. a student loan, a pell grant, etc. and puts the money in a bank account and later gets an abortion using funds in that bank account, it does not mean that federal money subsidized the abortion.  Second, what was actually in the bill:   ""specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.  On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose.""    http://www.politifact.com/florida/ statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/ taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-healt h-care-bill/",1,1

Is it OK to kill them too?  I will agree with you other point that women (and men) should be able to do whatever it is they want to their own bodies.

"So then you are one of the pro-aborts who believe the woman has the right to kill all the way through the 40 weeks, right? Wow.   But the created human being is not apart of the womans body that is what you just don't get. She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either. The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame...unless a rape occurred.   Abortion is the most performed medical procedure on earth. It is not like other procedures as abortion kills. The abortionists task, goal is to make sure the human being who is alive, is dead when he/she gets through with it. Now if you don't value life then you condone it. If you do, then you don't. Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body.,,just a safe place to grow and mature. Pregnancy and giving birth is the most natural thing on earth. It has been going on since the beginning of time. Most pregnancies are uncomplicated and most women would do fine never even seeing a doctor during pregnancy.   A child who is alive would get all the things you say they wouldnt. No hospital on earth would deny lifesaving measures taken to save a child. Even in the cases where parents want to deny....for religious reasons, the courts usually overturn their wishes. Also in the case of death...if parents kill their child out of the womb....its murder. If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1,1

Being inside something is NOT the same as being part of something and ones body does not belong to another’s body merely because of proximity. Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried.   In July 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill making it illegal to execute a pregnant woman. The logical reason for this decision is that a preborn child is an individual person, distinct from his mother and with his own separate right to life. As I said our laws are wishy washy.   Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence should they? I am sure you would think that premature baby lying in a hospital incubator deserves to live. Would the exact same baby deserve to live any less because she was still in her mother?  But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   Your worldview is sad...........  You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic. I picket them...never seen one dragged in, not in ten years. No woman gets an abortion unless SHE CONSENTS. Place the blame where it belongs. It is her body she has the right to decide. There are places that would help her....I work in one.",1,0

"""This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.""   A mammalian cell, if processed to revert it back to totipotency, will grow into a zygote, and then a full human. This is like asexual reproduction. Your line of reasoning is flawed.  Now you just defined the concept of human life to include an unthinking mass of tissue cells. That cheapens what it means to be human.   ""This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.""   Consequences of a truth do not make the truth any less correct. Humans are defined by their ability to think, reason, and learn; they are defined by a culture spanning tens of thousands of years. Homo sapiens sapiens is defined by genetic relationship. Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).   ""What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.""   You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.   ""You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.""   Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.   ""The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference. ""   You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life.   ""Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.""   I ignore it because it has no rights. It isn't human. If you can't understand why a mass of cells smaller than a skin flake without a brain isn't human, then I suggest you stop arguing and read some college-level biology textbooks. You need a biology education.  But we're hovering around why you believe it is human, actually. This is probably a religious matter for you, not grounded in evidence, or logic.   ""And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.""   It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born. Stop using language that is categorically wrong in order to try and tie together a poor argument.   ""When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).""   I could argue that my religion treats as matter of faith that sperm has souls in all the cells, and that spilling sperm wastefully is murdering all those souls. I could them take up a moral platform with my church and crusade across the country trying to get masturbation banned along with pornography, and sex education.  The point to take from this is that these issues are rooted in dogma that cannot be argued away. Science already provides some clear-cut information that could be used to answer the question of whether a fetus or zygote is alive or should be properly construed as human in a legal context. Dogmatic people insist upon having beliefs however, with no evidence to support themselves beyond the emotional and intuitive appeal of their arguments.

I know that your immediate reaction is to take offense to this statement, but know that the only reason that there appears to be a difference between your problem with homosexuals and the racism that used to exist (and in some places still exists) in America is that the former is more socially acceptable.  Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. ""Dude, don't be gay"" or ""what are you a faggot?"" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people. I'm probably guilty of using similar phrases myself, and I'm not proud of that fact. What I desperately want you to understand is that homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice. Some people are  born  different, and if we shun them for being different, make fun of them, and convince them that the feelings that they have are immoral, then we really are no better then the racists of our past.  You claim homosexuality to be immoral. When I attack this point, you hide behind a Bible and complain about me attacking your opinions. Then when I argue that there are numerous acts that the Bible considers immoral, but yet you choose to ignore, you say something along the lines of,  well obviously that stuff isn't immoral , and I would agree. There is nothing immoral about touching pigskin, or eating shellfish. However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe.  So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral?

I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.  It is so nice and warm in here.  Month Three  You know what Mommy  I'm a boy / girl!  I hope that makes you happy.  I always want you to be happy.  I don't like it when you cry.  You sound so sad.  It makes me sad too  and I cry with you even though  you can't hear me.

I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes  and stretch my arms and legs.  I am becoming quite good at it too.  Month Five  You went to the doctor today.  Mommy, he lied to you.  He said that I'm not a baby.  I am a baby Mommy, your baby.  I think and feel.  Mommy, what's abortion?  Month Six  I can hear that doctor again.  I don't like him.  He seems cold and heartless.  Something is intruding my home.  The doctor called it a needle.  Mommy what is it? It burns!  Please make him stop!  I can't get away from it!  Mommy! HELP me!  Month Seven  Mommy  I am okay.  I am in Death's arms.  He is holding me.  He told me about abortion.  Why didn't you want me Mommy?  Every Abortion Is Just . . .  One more heart that was stopped.

"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you.   Just asked my brother. Nope, one can be neither for nor against abortion. It's called CHOICE. It's not a matter of ""abortion is good/bad!"" abortion is just an act. ""Good"" and ""bad"" are labels imposed by you.   Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion.   I'm 90% sure you're a troll now. Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Say it with my now; Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Pro choice is about individuals choosing to either get an abortion or not based on their own unique situation.    Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge.   Man, you're really judgmental, aren't you. ;)  I don't particularly care if you find me selfish and ignorant, you have yet to give a relevant reason as to why abortion should be illegal. Not once in all your barely comprehend able posts have you done this.   Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence.   Actually, this is YOUR debate, or did you mean argument? ;)  There is no inconsistent information in my argument because I haven't posted any ""information"", I've only been debunking you, so now you're a liar. And a bad one at that, do you think I don't comprehend my own posts or something? XD   Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science.   I never even said anything remotely like that... -_-    You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts.   No, opinions should be built on RELEVANT facts. For example; I say you have made the logical fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"" this is a fact. You say ""Woma have died from abortions, therefore abortion should be wrong"" This is also a fact, it just isn't a relevant one. And if your argument is based on fallacies and irrelevant facts &gt;&gt;YOU ARE WRONG&lt;&lt;   Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy.   ... Do you think I care? Really? Let them read it. I'll debate them too if they carry your idiocy with them.   I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.   And are they all ""pro-life"" too? If so, I've nothing to worry about. ;)   You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance.    You're projecting again ;)   You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey.   Oh, I've thought about what you're trying to convey; I've just decided it's wrong relative to the topic is all, ;)   When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.   Again, I'm not against facts. I'm against your stupidity. I'm against the conclusions you've derived from these facts. Stop trying to pass the blame onto the facts, they can't change, but you sure as hell can.   And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.   ... And yet you have. Is your dunce cap on too tight or something?   There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute.   Man, it takes a lot of repetition for you to learn, doesn't it? I never said you can't use these things, hell you may even win a debate with them if you're talking to someone even dumber than you (insert your own ""country full of idiots for you to talk to"" joke)... but when you're talking to someone intelligent enough to recognize a logical fallacy (e.g. Myself... and everyone else on this site) you're bound to get called out on it.  And, if you're entire argument is based on a fallacy, then you're wrong. Thus, you lose.   And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.   Selfishness? THIS IS SSSSSSSSSayyad99's attempt at hurting my feelings?

"You kept saying that abortion is right?   Sayyad, stop straw-manning me right now. I never once said anything even close to ""abortion is right"". You keep putting words in my mouth. Do you understand how a debate works?   Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible?   This isn't even something I've said either. I don't care if abortion makes a person more ""responsible"" so I never said anything about it. I, unlike you, do not need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it.      You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care.   Again, nothing you've said thus far has anything to do with anything I've said. When did I say I don't care? I'm here aren't I? I didn't care about you're story, but I do care about the issue and your story is irrelevant to it. When did I say you were ""throwing out stuff just like that""? Wtf does something like that even mean?  Either you have the wrong address, or you're the single worst debater I've spoken to thus far.   How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest?   How abortion started doesn't matter. Why would it? It has nothing to do with the issue now.    If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion?   Does this pass for logic these days???  If I don't know anything about abortion then how come you added the number ""99"" to your user name? =/  (note: I'm saying your question doesn't make sense)   Who looks more silly? Me or you?    You or I&lt;&lt;   You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice   Do you not even see your own conceitedness?  You're saying ""I've decided abortion is immoral and I've also decided that everyone should conform to my morality because my morality cannot be wrong, I came up with it!""  Well, how great full these women must be to have someone like you do decide that abortion is wrong for them. =/  And you say this is  not  silliness?   Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics.   Oh dear god. YOU got into law school? Hopefully not to be a lawyer, you'd end up sending all your own clients to the chair.  You think I care that you're a law student? Do you think that makes you infallible? You sir, are beyond egotistical.   Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence.   Now you're just projecting. ;)   Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.    You're not even trying to make sense now, are you? Are you a troll? You must be, no one else could string together so many irrelevant ""arguments"" and walk away feeling like they've accomplished something.   i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance.   Ah, that explains why you didn't bother proof reading your argument. =/   When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Alright, so a reference is pointless because where life begins is a philosophical question, it isn't proven based on how many more people agree with you.  Life is a continuum. It doesn't ""stop"" or ""start"", it just changes.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   jeez, I don't know what I'm more disappointed in; your poor grammar or the fact that I understood that perfectly =/  A person's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves. Unless she's being raped for money, then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   I don't care. Women could get abortions as a hobby for all I care, I don't need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it, I'm not as egotistical as you.   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   Again, I don't care and it doesn't matter. It's their choice. They're making the risk, not you, not I. It's none of out business.    Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   When did I say this? I didn't, because it's not my position.   Try again.   If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts.   Or it means you're an idiot and you can't tell the difference between relevant facts and appeals to emotion/authority.  Anyone can pull up an infinite amount of facts, it mean nothing if they aren't relevant. Though, it's cute how you thought writing this would somehow convince me to answer all your questions as though they  were  relevant. XD   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified.   You keep saying ""law student"" like being a law student matters. it doesn't. And I don't care if someone would ""disqualify"" you for what I've done because  1. It's irrelevant to this debate   and 2. I happen to know for a fact that calling ""non-sequiter"" on an opponent during a debate is not only allowed, but frequently taken advantage of.  So, either you are a liar or your debating league is full of idiots.  Judging by your argument thus far the former seems much more likely.    Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Why did you write this?

"Have you seen government spending lately? President Obama's 2010 Budget Deficit was $1.3 trillion.  For every dollar the government spends, that is one less dollar in the private economy, which the economy shrinks, which means less wealth is created.   We just entered and exited a great worldwide recession over a period of three years, in which Obama spent almost a trillion in economic stimulus.  Plus, we were in war, which is always expensive.

"The inevitable demise of the economy was near under the false pretenses of the success of the housing bubble, which was created by the expansion of credit by the Federal Reserve and the Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress.    I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  ""To me, money is fungible,"" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  ""It's a genuine paying back,"" White said. ""It does reduce the federal government's involvement."" Still, he said, ""it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate"" with the U.S. government.

"""But the American public has come to understand the bad that can come of these drugs.""   Annual deaths in the US from tobacco: 435,000  Annual deaths in the US from alcohol: 85,000  Total recorded deaths due to marijuana: 0  I'm not so sure people understand the harm that comes from them.  I don't see how you can support prohibition of marijuana, but not alcohol and tobacco without realizing what a hypocrite you are. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse no matter what metric you use.   ""Just because pot may not be physically addicting, does not mean it is not mentally addicting, which is just as bad. It means your brain is hooked and can't function without it. ""   No you can still function without it, you are thinking about the addiction that comes from cigarettes which you support. Marijuana can be psychologically addictive. All that means is that if you really like the feeling of being high, you will want to do it again. This does not mean you are not able to not do it. Anything that you enjoy can be psychologically addictive (Sex, gambling, createdebate.com). Even if marijuana were addictive like cigarettes and alcohol, you cannot use this point to argue against legalization unless you support prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. As I said name something bad that it doesn't have in common with those two drugs.   ""They tend to forget that marijuana smoke is 6 times worse than cigarette smoke, when it comes to carbon monoxide and the toxicity of the smoke itself.""   You have one misleading and one incorrect fact there. Marijuana smoke has been shown to not cause cancer. Scientists hypothesized that it would cause cancer because it contains more harmful chemicals, but when they did actual studies on live animals, they found absolutely no link between marijuana and any form of cancer. This is just one study by UCLA I can get more if you desire them.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html   So while it may be true that it contains more harmful chemicals, for whatever reason it still doesn't cause cancer.   In reference to the toxicity of the smoke, you couldn't be more wrong. Scientists have not been able to induce death in an animal due to marijuana. It's LD50, or quantity that would be lethal to half the population, is so high, that we cannot even find it. It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana and consequently there has never been a recorded death due to it.   http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm   I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you say smoke causes ""little nicks"" in arteries. Please cite an article or study because what you are saying makes no sense.  The study you cited by the British Lung Foundation doesn't appear to have been published in a peer reviewed medical journal like the studies that show marijuana is not harmful. Here is why the study is misleading.  They start out with a very bold statement  ""Smoking pure cannabis is more harmful to lungs than tobacco, a health charity is warning.""  So you continue on reading to see how exactly they proved that.  First ""evidence"":  ""A study by the British Lung Foundation found that just three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes. ""  First of all it is very uncommon to smoke three joints a day. Secondly they were most likely comparing unfiltered joints and filtered joints which is really intellectually dishonest. They also don't talk about what type of damage they are referring to. Marijuana smoke does temporarily paralyze the cilia or small hairs in your air passageways which can temporarily increase the risk of colds and other upper respiratory tract infections(OH NO). The smoke does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Furthermore there are other ways to ingest marijuana, including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals, vaporizing which releases only the THC and no harmful chemicals, and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals.  Second ""evidence"":  ""Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco. ""  As I said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say. While it may contain more carcinogens, it doesn't cause cancer. Numerous studies have failed to find any link. Yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer. Think about it, if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke, or even bad all, why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer, but so many showing tobacco causes cancer. There is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone.   http://www.salem-news.com/articles/ january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                           As I said, they don't have any concrete evidence that it causes health problems. It is not enough to say it contains dangerous chemicals. Especially when numerous studies show the chemicals don't cause damage.  You still somehow manage to fail to name one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes with evidence. Every thing you named once again is present in alcohol or tobacco and most of them weren't true.  So once again I ask you to name a negative result of marijuana that isn't present in tobacco or alcohol. And don't give me, 'it's too late to make alcohol and tobacco illegal.' First of all it is never too late, that is a cop out. But regardless of the pragmatism of making them illegal, I'll bet you still don't think we should.",0,1

"Good thing I provided the second link to show how it's still relevant.   Good thing that that article said that the entire 'comparing debt' idea was stupid, and that they're all as bad as each other.   Even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument, that is not NEARLY the amount that went up in spending under the Obama administration. Unless Corporate welfare counts...   Of course, but the $700 billion spent on stimulus, increased welfare spending, and decreased tax revenue, it would make a big part of the difference.   One that Obama continues, and even expanded by bombing Libya and progressing the disaster in Pakistan.   I haven't personally, but I bet if you compare the costs of conflicts that the two leaders started, you would see a massive difference. However, yes, I agree, Obama's foreign policy is not perfect. Part of why I have repeatedly claimed that he is simply the best of a bad lot.   Which will do practically nothing to cover the costs that he continues to spike. It's a red herring.   43 billion is not a small amount, and yet it is Republicans who continue to block it. This is not Obama's fault.   I was referring to his proposal on Healthcare, not something a decade ago (that actually also led to economic prosperity. If it wasn't for the war, Bush would have a much better legacy in economics).   I agree, I was saying I don't trust him because of what happened a decade ago. And Bush's deregulation (under Ryan's plan) lead to the market crash and the recession we're still in.

"It seems we may of been arguing definitions  Free thinking and free will are synonyms to me; as is perspective and mindset. mindset can be seen as a perspective with a positive feedback loop.

A human being is not a god. Although god is an ambiguous word and in one sense i can say that, and in another sense i can say i am my own god. Perhaps god is a word which should be avoided in debate due to its ambiguity.  Abortion constitutes many other debates, it is a debate which rests upon many other debates.

"The answer to the question, does marijuana effect the brain? Marijuana does not effect the brain in damage, but it can alter in functions. Marijuana effects the perception of time, distance, and speed. It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. ""Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness."" So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, ""depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy."" 123helpme.com  This make you want to smoke mary? :) cus it certainly doesnt apeal to me.",0,0

What we are saying is if that's what you want to do fine, but don't ask us the American people to support you in that decision. Our Government was established to support Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Anything that works against those goals, like homosexuality, is well, against it and not in support of it.

"I think marijuana should be legalized for various reasons.   First of all, let me make it clear that I currently do not consume marijuana. I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people.

"Abortion is a way to prevent more poor families, suffering children, and used as back up when birth control fails.  I don't think anyone who used protection in sex should be saddled with a child.

"I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   With conjoined twins, the ownership of the body can be disputed. They share bones and organs; it is not a clear-cut case of one separate but dependent organism residing in another. I know there is physiological variation with conjoined twins, but take Abigail and Brittany Hensel as an example:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel    How can one sister make a claim to the shared organs at the expense of the other sister? They own them equally. I don't believe a fetus can be said to own any part of the mother's body  at all , much as less as much as the mother does.  Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved. Except, in the case of abortion, the benefiting party is not a person yet.",1,1
"Hmmmm.   I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.

"It's funny how everyone blames the Republicans for this recession. ""Blame the Republicans. It's really their fault."" That just shows how uneducated everyone in his fan-club is.

The fact is that the fault crosses party lines. However, Obama had Congress in the palm of his hand for two years and they did everything he wanted. They authorized bailout after bailout, and let him spend as much as he pleased. Now common sense can tell you that when you don't have any money, you need to stop spending as much.

"Firstly, unless I missed it, you  still  have not answered my hypothetical question regarding mandatory organ donation to sick people. Why is this?   One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?   You gave me a page from a pro-life page, basically biased by default because they are trying to convince readers that their agenda is the correct one. I gave you four scientific and unbiased sources that defined a parasite-host relationship between two organisms. Not two species. Two organisms. If you cannot see how the fetus fits that definition, which you clearly cannot, then you are beyond being reached by explanation.   So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well?   Perhaps. But, regardless, their life is not dependent on the body of another, therefor there is no need for their death if someone does not want to be involved with them. I am saying this to cut off another rebuttal about euthanizing comatose patients.    Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.   If it is not a brain or a consciousness that gives us our identity, but rather the simple possession of human DNA and the act of being kept alive by a heart, then again, I contend that a fetus and a human liver are equally alive and deserve comparable rights.    Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus?   This is absolute nonsense. I really have no idea what you are trying to say.    Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?   I think I have said before that nobody kills a fetus  because  it is alive, or  because  it has a heart. Please pay attention to the implications of sentence structure. People might kill a fetus because it is dependent on their body and they do not want it to reside in their body anymore, and there is no way to remove it without causing its death.    Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?    I am not in criminal law so I almost hesitate to say this, but it seems as though you were taught false or, at best, misleading information.   http://www.chronline.org/ Feticide%20versus%20Homicide.pdf     But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with?    It's relevance.    Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Okay. I think I understand your train of thought and why you keep harping on the whole not dead = alive thing. If this is incorrect, point out where I went wrong.  Anything that is distinguishable from the dead = alive  Anything that is alive = a life  The act of ending a life = killing  Killing = murder  Murder = homicide  If this is a correct summary of your line of thinking, then you draw no distinctions between different forms of life, their capabilities, and the rights they are afforded, and additionally, you draw no distinction between murder and any other method of ending any form of life. It would mean that shooting someone in pure self defense = homicide. Accidentally striking a pedestrian who was not in a cross walk = homicide. Slaughtering a chicken for food = homicide. Plucking a flower = homicide. Using antibacterial soap = homicide.   If this is incorrect, then I actually do not have any idea why you keep bringing this point up, because clearly you  are  capable of   a) distinguishing between different forms of life   b) realizing that life with higher functions are granted more rights under the law, and  c) understanding that the law does not protect any form of life from being ended by any means.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.   People estimate that as few as 15% and as high as 78% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, many times before the woman even knew she was pregnant. Even on the low end of the estimate, that is a lot of women to subject to a homicide investigation directly after they experience miscarriage. Then, if it has been convincingly shown the abortion was not 'spontaneous' (how? I have no idea), then comes the problem of deciding how responsible a woman is. What if she smokes or drinks, possibly causing a fatally premature birth? What if she fell down a flight of stairs, how will she prove she didn't do it on purpose? What if she stays in a relationship with an abusive man who eventually beat her so bad she miscarried; is this not causing death through inaction? What if she didn't obey her doctor's order of strict bed rest? What if she went on a roller coaster ride or ate some sushi? What if she just stressed herself out too much? How much jail time do the women in each of these situations deserve?",1,1

No abortion is wrong. It's as simple as that it is an option but an evil one. However that being said I do think that having laws against it really doesn't make sense people ought to have the choice that does not however on any terms make it right.,0,0
"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery.   That we currently do is no argument that we ought to continue.   It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)   If you want to represent prenatal care or the rearing of a child as a waste of resources, I'll leave the untruth of that as self evident.   Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small.   I have a different hunch about these things than you, but I also suspect we can only contrast our opinions here sans any kind of statistical evidence.   Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people.   I don't think so.   A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences.   I am not arguing against the small fraction of abortions that are medically necessary.   There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.    I think I am, considering that most abortions are not by necessity but by choice.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body.   There is no legal basis to support the importance of a fathers right to protect his unborn child.   You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).    I could argue that a woman who willingly engages in the sort of sexual relations that commonly result in pregnancy should thereby confer certain legal rights to the father. It's the beginning of a shared responsibility so there should be shared commensurate rights. If a woman can legally compel a man to be held responsible after birth, he should have some legal say prior to.   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions.   No disagreement from me there.   Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established.   To the contrary...Living beings that don't meet your imaginary criteria, merit protection due to moral concerns. For instance if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents.   A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.  Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).

I hope you don't have that picturesque little household with a white picket fence, with a mom and dad, and a Golden Retriever who brings in the paper, et cetera... because  that  would be weird.  It's a matter of perception. And I have to tell you that other than biblical references, there is no excuse for thinking being gay is wrong. Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children. They aren't retarded. They understand the world, and the people in it. And they have love to give, and can create a stable environment for a child just as well as a straight couple.

The reason why we have financial problems is because most americans dont understand the fundamentals of Kaynesian Economics and because of this we have had economic and tax policies that favor the supply side ""trickle down economics"" rather than demand side which hasnt really had a good shot since Kaynesian economics became the main stream.

"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.",1,1

You would not help a schizophrenic individual by giving them two cups of tea, one for them and one for their imaginary friend, so why then would you support two men or women getting married? This is what I dont understand. Can homosexuality be treated, maybe. Can it be studied, not objectively as Homosexuals dont want to be fixed they want to be accepted which I completely understand. However, you can accept the behavior without condoning it and this is what America is saying. Yes, you are free to do what you want, but we do not recognize it as being healthy and no, we will not legitimize it by recognizing it through one of our most wildly held social traditions. I believe society as a whole has this right and its important that we do.   On a separate note, I dont think the state should have anything to do with making laws with regards to marriage or recognizing them, however I stand by my original premise that at least attempting to correct the behavior is better than condoning it.",0,0

"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it’s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it’s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born.

Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

"To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is ""only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ""—not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslims—it's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera—oh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.  Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman—it is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)—and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in God—hey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choice—no one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like that—it is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing.   Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame?   ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)  Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religion—the majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words.",0,0

"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.",0,1
"Oh Yea, there is something obvious that I forgot in my original point, or points:     Borrowing money. Borrowing money from people who print money and devalue their currency is just as bad a printing money. Actually it's worse, it' puts you in debt the your borrowers i.e. China. Only if every country is free of debt to another will they truly be free.   Just like there are casualties of ware over territory,security, goods and other things, now there is a different war over debt that may require casualties in the name of true freedom. Though these will not be as obvious as soldiers on the battlefeild. They will be the ones who die due to cuts in medical programs and welfare programs. Medicare, Medicaid, and social security are the biggest share of our debt and we keep borrowing money from countries with no working standards or conditions to avoid the inevitable. The pay out that will leave us all broke. When the elderly outnumber the people working to support them. Or better their bills outnumber the wages of those who support them.   Freedom comes at a cost. Only those who are willing to make the sacrifices will get it.   So far I see Obama is willing to make some sacrifices, but not the tough ones. Tough ones are required to climb out of the hole which we have dug. The borrowing has to stop. The printing has to stop. Or we will never get out.   I'm sorry that's just what logic dictates.

I'm personally against abortion.  We must look at the reasons women have abortions. In general it has to do with irresponsibility. Very rarely the reasons are medical or rape. Should society be responsible for a females irresponsibility?  Another problem I have is the availability. The first thought that comes to the mind is abortion. If the couple feel they will have financial difficulties - abortion is the first answer. Not improving their home economics or getting better jobs. Abortion should always be the last action - not the first.  However in this society I don't think we can live without abortion. It's like coffee - we don't need it.. but we choose to be controlled by it. So if we are to keep it - it should be heavily regulated.,0,0

"Obama’s greatest achievement…writing books about guess who? Barack Obama. He is a master manipulator and lied before the election and continues to do that today. He never would come clean about birth certificate until Trump went after him…then all of a sudden one pops up. ???? Was he really born in America?     He consistently lied about the war. In 2008 after the Democratic convention he stated that we had an “absolute obligation” to stay in Iraq that it would be a disservice to all who lost their lives there. ”The failure of the Iraqi state would be a disaster,” he said at a lunch sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “It would dishonor the 900-plus men and women who have already died. . . . It would be a betrayal of the promise that we made to the Iraqi people, and it would be hugely destabilizing from a national security perspective.” Yet he took a different stance while campaigning. He said one of the first things he would do would be to bring all the troops home and end the war. We all know that…that did not happen.  Is he, was he ever a Muslim? Well……he would like you to believe that he was not…but he has given many different answers to this question. Was he a constitutional law professor? He stated that he was and that’s why he knew the law better than Bush. That was a lie however as he was only a senior lecturer.   He can’t give a speech (with or without a teleprompter) and when he does its full of errors. Remember the Kansas tornado tragedy? He stated for the record that over 10,000 people died that an entire town was destroyed. Actually the town was ok and only 12 died.   He can’t figure out whether he is for decriminalizing pot or against it. He says what the audience wants to hear and did that to get votes. In a presidential debate he sided with most the other Demos…said he was against it. BUT later in a speech in Illinois to college students he said the opposite as he did in a debate at Northwestern University.  He lied about his pastor Rev. Wright (uncle to him, who baptized him and Michele and just happens to be godfather to his girls)….he never heard all those anti-white speeches, not a one.   And then there is Tony Rezko…..and Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn….and his staff who are self admitted socialists.     He said he never took a dime from a Washington lobbyist. Lie he did.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/ election2008/2008-04-15-obama_N.htm    Then he lied about tax cuts….denies attacking small businesses……all while he was raking in money, political contributions from those associated with Fannie and Freddie.     Tell me what he has ever done for the middle class?     He hates Israel. Gee I wonder why? Maybe because he bowed to a Saudi King, maybe because he studied the Koran when he attended Islamic schools….oh yes that’s right he is Christian.   He sure did not learn history at Harvard. He has no idea how many states there are in the United States where he just happens to be commander in chief.

"Abstinence means to abstain. You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.  About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them. The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them. Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible. So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up. Hey kids will be kids, right? Come on. Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.  Also, giving condoms is giving permission. You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear. Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it. What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem. I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.  Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them. Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance. So, lets expect more out of kids and not less.",1,0

"OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?  I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.  Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.  I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.  What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy.   So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context.   But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.  So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons.   So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.",1,0

"There you go again. I disagree with you, so i'm a bigot. If someone thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a bigot, what does that make them? (I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)  The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.  Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances.   I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.  1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.  2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.  I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.  I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower).",0,0

It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1,1
"I made 2 very clear points for you to argue, but again you've gone and taken the scenic route all over the countryside, what's more, you've actually missed the 2 sights you were supposed to visit, here I'll number for you so you won't miss them:  1 - Abortions have good reasons to exist, that's why they exist.  2 - We can remove fetuses if we want and we don't need any excuses. It's not the same as killing people. We're not in shortage of fetuses in the world.   Now, focus!

The results of these exams should be made available to the United States and the families of the victims of Pan Am 103”  “the welcoming reception that Megrahi might receive if he is permitted to travel abroad would be extremely inappropriate given Megrahi's conviction for a heinous crime that continues to have a deep and profound impact on so many.

"“For You created my inmost being;You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child … And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth?   During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?    Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.” In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.   Many pro-choice posters say “My Body. My Right.” Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Lord knew you, even before conception!    Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says “If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.”   But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound.   Luke 1:42-44 says “In a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.” When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said “Both Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ‘unplanned’ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is.",1,0
"marijuance creates LACK of concentration, not an increase of concentration!   Marijuana is addicting, no matter what you say. If made legal, it will become a competitive market just like any other thing. (At least for those who don't grow it). That would mean there would still be [illegal] sellers, as they would be breeding more powerful strains to get more powerful amount of THC levels.   The more powerful it is the more addicting. Substance abuse is a health problem. We already have a huge health-care industry centered around alcohol/drug abuse. You want to add to the list?   The Tobacco Companies wait in anticipation so they can start packaging and selling to more idiots. That's right--I'm talking marijuana. No doubt they pay for studies to try to prove that marijuana is ""harmless"". They see big dollar signs, just like with tobacco.  The FDA would have to get involved to ""put a limit"" on ""acceptable"" drug levels. They would also have to enforce these rules, And just like with alcohol, they have to watch for ""bootleg"" sellers who try to sell dangerous products.

"How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   semantics...

If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.

"I do not believe in abortion. You are killing a living breathing human being. I understand why certain people might want to get an abortion, i.e they were raped or can't afford to take care of it, but if that's the case then just give the child to someone else.     This is a human being:   http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring08/ images/amazing_human_being_01.jpg    This is a foetus:   http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/06/ foetusREX010606_228x188.jpg    It has no mind. It has no awareness. It is a burden to someone else. This is why abortion exists.",1,1
"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?   Yes, in the case that the lower-awareness individual cannot speak, or even comprehend their rights, for example. I suppose I should have added the qualifier that when the difference between awareness is so great that one of the individuals cannot even understand their situation, it seems reasonable to give custody of the body to the other who can.   If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.    It has all within its scope which care about foetal awareness. Some arguments are purely rights based, and see the mother as executive over her body.  With regards to AFS, I think the primary way it can be used without being seen as arbitrary is that if we find that a foetus isn't developed enough to be aware of its environment, then it isn't perceived as cruel to end its life because it isn't even aware of what it lost. I suppose this can be thought of as a stretch on the saying ""What he doesn't know won't hurt him."" This I believe is also a way to justify euthanasia (such as for deep-coma patients) because it is currently understood that they aren't even aware of their existence. So in other words under these contexts, an AFS isn't an argument for what the person will or may feel in the near future, but instead an argument used to justify a procedure as not being cruel to the recipient presently. Another strain of it arguably appears when we feel consoled when a person dies in their sleep, it is seen as less violent or cruel for that person to die while not aware of it.  An AFB would have the benefit of allowing human clones who are born without brains (beyond what is necessary for autonomic functions I suppose) to exist rationally to serve as organ hosts.  The UPA argument is the hardest to defend because as we both saw, it relies on a very grey boundary of what we feel is ""too soon"" or ""too late."" Science will be our best friend here, but we must always remember how life is rarely divided into discreet units that are easily divided.",1,1

I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin.""

By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like.

You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me.

"Thanks for making my point. Your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. You said ""Marriage is a contract"" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. A contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. And historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. Which leads us to the next question.  ""When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?""  In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report;  http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/                                        costofdivorce.pdf    So yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it.

"""Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,"" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.""  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   ""The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists""  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  ""no law respecting an establishment of religion""  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that ""other"" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future.

"Effectiveness of the War On Drugs:  ""Police arrested an estimated 872,720 persons for cannabis violations in 2007, the highest annual total ever recorded in the United States, according to statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Of those charged with cannabis violations, approximately 89 percent, 775,137 Americans were charged with possession only. An American is now arrested for violating cannabis laws every 38 seconds. ""  -Obviously, from this you can see that it's completely failing: the American people want to smoke pot and there's nothing that can be done about it.  Cost:  ""Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 43,266 inmates per year. About 25 per cent are sentenced for drug law violations. "" -Many of these people's lives were completely ruined by incarceration.  ""The U.S. federal government spent over $19 billion dollars in 2003 on the War on Drugs, at a rate of about $600 per second. The budget has since been increased by over a billion dollars. "" - All these tax dollars spent in attempt to prevent something that's never going away and millions of hard working American citizens enjoy.  So the war on drugs is completely un-effective and also extremely costly in terms of human life, happiness, and finances. All quotes taken from  http://www.drugsense.org/wodclock.htm  which has further references.  Also, read the government's findings on marijuana here:  http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    Keep in mind most of everything that is said in this report uses words such as ""may"" and ""could"" because nothing, as of now, is conclusive. This is in spite of the fact that we as humans have been using it for thousands of years. My feeling on this is that if marijuana actually is dangerous....then not only would we know it from hearing about it, but these studies would have conclusive, definitive results. Not wishy-washy, half-assed results. Also: you won't find anything in that report that is worse than existing legal substances and pharmacueticals (think vicoden, lithium, valuum, morphein, wel butron, etc.).  So...what the hell? Why are we having a war on pot?   Results of ending the war on drugs: no more tax money being spent, millions of Americans' lives will be instantly better as they will not be incarcerated, etc. A new industry will be created that will provide tax revenue, jobs, etc. A small number (comparatively) of government workers would lose their jobs.  Results of not ending the war on drugs: DEA agents, etc. and others will not lose their jobs. Politicians will continue to have something to be proud of and market themselves with. People will continue to use drugs anyway, as history has shown and nothing will change as it is now and has been since it was made illegal.  An alternative to the war on drugs? We need to shift our thinking from drug addict, CRIMINALS to drug addict, PATIENTS. Meaning these people need help, not jail. There's a reason they are taking the drug - lets solve the problem with using therapy, clinics, raising awareness, and educating people so that they can make their own healthy decisions.

Apparently taking away rights from homosexuals is more important. There is absolutely no proof that children who grow up in homosexual households suffer any sort of added mental problems. In fact, a court in Arkansas had  unanimously  agreed to overturn a ban on gay couples becoming foster parents because the reasons stated were, to be frank, bullshit.  The only way that we can fight homophobia is by showing people that homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight couples. I know you say yo don't hate gays, but why do you oppose gay marriage?

"Guess what? Marriage is a ""civil union"".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of ""civil"" in this situation is ""of or pertaining to civil law"". Civil law is ""the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters.""  One definition of ""union"" is ""the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage"". As I said, marriage is a civil union.   So people who want gays to be able to form civil unions are in effect supporting gay marriage.  However same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.   When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benfits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marrige be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in an illegal way toward same sex couples.

I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.

How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate. Especially when this is all under the influence of safe-sex, you have no basis to say that sex is wrong outside these variables of yours.    ""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""   Funny that, it sounds as if you read all of it and didn't have anything easy to rebut so you ignored it in your next dispute. Also if you read it properly without such a bias opinion you would be less inclined to be falsely prophesizing your point of view in a spurious fashion. Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that""  -""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  -""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays” ROFL WTF?!  And now,  -""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""",1,1
"Did you forget the following examples?  Hosea 13:16 (King James Version)  16Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.  Numbers 31:15-18 (King James Version)  15And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  16Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.  17Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  18But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  Hosea 9:11-17 (King James Version)  11As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.  12Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!  13Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  14Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.  15All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.  16Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.  17My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.  Judges 11:30-40 (King James Version)  30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,  31Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.  32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.  33And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.  34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.  35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.  36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.  37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.  38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.  39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,  40That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.  2 Kings 2:23-24 (King James Version)  23And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.  1 Samuel 15:2-3 (King James Version)  2Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.  3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.",1,1
"""You all keep telling us that it's murder!""   Murder is not the word that I would use.  I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.   Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue. By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child. So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.  Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference. We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion. Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.  In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is the  biggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!  Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands. And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that is  just plain stupid . The Government  can  have a say in education, but they  cannot  examine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex. It would be a full time job with prostitutes.  So, hopefully I've cleared up a few things, and hopefully you finally understand where I am coming from.",1,0

EVEN IF we insisted on calling a fetus a person before then.

"In reality   Or whatever passes for reality in your mind.   Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol   Can you provide any evidence? You see, I can provide a lot to indicate otherwise. Alcohol kills, according to NORML, around 85,000 people a year! Tobacco kills 435,000 people each year! Then we come down to good ol' Mary Jane, and she isn't responsible for a single death.   Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug   Marijuana has been proven to not be a gateway drug.   into crack cocaine, heroin    Nope    opium   WHO THE HELL DOES OPIUM ANY MORE?!?   It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed.    Depends on the user. I've known people who smoked until they greened out, but others only take a toke or two to relax.   When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional.    This is based purely on personal observation, but I'd say that one is more functional when high, but functional in a different manner.   Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed   Yet it still is more damaging to the body than weed!   Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco   Depends on how much you smoke. All day every day, probably; but most people aren't like that.   however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does   You hear about drunk driving all the time, but I've never heard of a case where the only intoxicant involved was ganja.   Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain.   Willing to provide evidence for this?   Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected.   As somebody who actually smokes pot occasionally, I disagree with this.   With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run.   That just sounds plain ridiculous!   Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues   Slow down?! Cheeba saves lives!   it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue.   Depends on the issue, I should imagine. It helps people going through chemo to eat, which is pretty damn useful if you want to, you know, LIVE.   Same goes with prescription medicine.   Compare the negative side effects of, say, just about any prescription medicine with the negative side effects of sensimilla. I dare you.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because politicians, doctors, and those involved with Big Pharma make shitloads of money from their legality.   I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case   Fortunately. Herb should be used because of its benefits to all, not just the sick.   Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults.   As well as many adults. Most people, once again in my experience, do not abuse it. Most people use it recreationally, and it does less harm than good.   There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill.   Too many trillions wasted on finding and incarcerating those non-violent users of drugs?

You said 'circumstance doesn't matter unless the women is dying on the table'. That's hypocrisy. Hypocrite.   Also, why does my opinion not matter in the case of abortion? Because I don't feel what an abortion is like? That's a very sexist thing to say. You're right when it comes to dead beat fathers, but they wouldn't give an opinion in the first place. I have the right to my opinion and half of the decision over the abortion my wife may or may not receive for the same reason that my wife ALSO has the right to her opinion and half of the deicsion over the  kidney donation  I may or may not do! You have a problem if you think neither have those rights in that situation. In fact, you're sexist if you think I don't deserve an opinion in that situation. Sexist.   My opinion is nothing like that. How is it like that? You're saying things that have absolutely no substance... back them up.

"Alright, I thought I'd throw this into the discussion (a logic bomb?), based upon my research I've ascertained that the majority of abortions don't even fall into the argument from sapience.   http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                       facts/after_12_weeks.html    Name your source, they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve (88% to 89% according to each).   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png    This handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10-12.  According to wikipedia, the nervous system begins development around week ten.  So, from all this information, I would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness (no brain) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they can't be aware. In this case I think the remaining 11% to 12% of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed.  I applaud you for a well-reasoned argument, but I had some ideas which weren't considered:   #1   Suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother.  Suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person (as you explained cogently, the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary, at least in a legal sense).  In this case, one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother, who has greater capacity for individuality, thought, and so-forth, right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and isn't yet granted the ""benefit of the doubt"" which the title of personhood confers.   #2   Suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of ""dead"" where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience.  In this case, all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart doesn't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen. It's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood.   #3   Suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus doesn't become a ""baby"" until say, week X (where X is some high week, like between 30 and 36).  In this case, the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion.   #4   This is basically an extended version of #1, but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience, and with high priority.  Suppose we consider the mother's rights as a person to be of paramount importance. These include a right over her body.  In this case, it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system, even if it means that around 1% of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses. We consider their sapience to be less than the woman's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live.  I'd like to address some of what you said:    AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.  BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?   I believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease, is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception. In other words, under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers, that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest, and that test reveals something to be lost. Similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met, and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example, not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer (which technically might disqualify you, but police don't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone).",1,1

Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution.   This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad.   It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires.

"You sated:  ""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.   If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""  My response:  Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another.   You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.  Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.  Again, you stated:   'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'  Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:  Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.  Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.  Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.  Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.  Reductio ad absurdum!  Again, you stated:  'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. '  What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.  Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities.   You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”  Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.  And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best.   The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers.",0,0

At times it seems like he might as well not even be there. Good friends of mine have grown up in motherless houses, split between parents and in fatherless houses. A nuclear family is not proven to be best. All my friends are quite well as am myself. Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.   It should also be noted a teenage mother is only a teenager for so long. One of my best friends girl-friends was a teenage mom(and now just a mom), another one of my best friends ex-girlfriends became pregnant by another man shortly after they broke up and is either 16 or 17. I have seen these women and their situation and i fully believe that they still possess every opportunity in the world if not more then they would have not being a mother. Neither of them have rich parents by the way. they are actually on the lower end of the economic spectrum.",1,0

"It's not so much killing as denying a chance at life. The argument isn't ""is it ok to kill a newborn"". Abortion involves fetuses and all the ""if it has nails it can feel pain"" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument ""we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance"" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than ""a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain"".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child.

I don't believe the baby had a choice which body it wanted to inhabit.   The easy answer is when it is born. The more complicated answer is when it has developed its brain.",1,1
"Technically speaking, a fetus is not a human yet. Having an abortion is similar to wearing a condom. No baby is made, yet intercourse still happens.",1,1
gay marriages should be allowed and there should be not hinderence to it dear. y do you wanna become an obstacle in their way. some men have it internally and if they do then let them. y are we to be bothered??,0,1
Hell no! His policies are crap and I can't wait for the courts to overturn his health care bill crap ;),1,0
"Yeah, but what about alcohol and tobacco? It's OK for those substances to be legal? Some people like to use recreational drugs because it gives them a different perspective of things. Sure, it's harmful for their bodies but who are we to say what they can and cannot do to themselves? Personally I'd prefer more stoners around than all the murders that occur because of the illegal trafficking.",0,1
"Alright, I can tell you are either very young or have some kind of mental handicap as you have great difficulty grasping the subtleties of language that aren't explicitly explained to you.   I called you a hypocrite because you believe you have the right to force others to conform to your preferences while I don't regardless of the fact that the body in question belongs to neither of us.   I don't care about your sob story. I really don't. If you can't debate outside of emotional appeals then we are done here. You lose.",1,1
"Marijuana gives people the munchies and Americans are already fat, they don't need to get fatter. A fatter American means an ugly American. Also, a stoned American comes across as a dumb American. We need a complete make over ;)",1,0

I applaud your ability to not impose your personal beliefs on others. If only more religious people could be like you.,1,1
"I spent all weekend pulling weeds and spraying Round-Up and laying plastic down to keep the weeds from coming up again, etc. If I had my druthers I would ban weeds so fast it would make your head spin and further more I would..... wait..... we're not talking the same thing, are we?",1,0
"Then I pity you.   Emotional sentiment is overrated.   Emotions are not illogical to those that have them   They matter to those who have them, but they often blind their judgment.   Rights are natural.   Rights are a human construct, and thus are unnatural.   Your Hobbesian   Hobbes? Was he the writer of Leviathon?   quickly leads to chaos and warfare.    Was the chaos and warfare of the middle ages caused by a lack of human rights? Or rather by overbearing monarchs?   Laws exist to promote peace and order.   How does homosexuality promote peace and order? Greece, Rome - all the homosexual 'hotspots' throughout history have fallen.",1,0
"I'm not sure this statment proves an unborn childs sapience. Its not all that refreshing either. Yes a fetus is alive. But 'alive' means nothing, it has no greater self-awareness.   Also just because it doesn't need ""anything added to it"", it doesn't mean it proves your point.",1,1
"weed should be legal.  it's the safest ""drug"" there is and it's ridiculous that alcohol and cigarettes are legal and killing people while marijuana is illegal and hasn't killed anyone.  plus it doesn't have any serious side effects, just makes you more relaxed and sometimes you think about things that never cross your mind while sober. i think the government has no right to dictate the way we live our life and what we do in our spare time as long as we're not hurting others or vandalizing property.  there's many other reasons why i think it should be legal, this is just a few of them.",0,1
Many abortion doctors admit that this baby is a living human being. Many baptize the babies after the abortion is finished.,1,0
"Abortion... abortion abortion abortion... How do I feel about it?  Hurm-  _  Well... I've never had one. I've never had a uterus anyhow. Whelp, I believe I'm disqualified.",0,1
"Bhagwad no one is trying to ban single parents, but the facts are most children thrive when there is a mother and farther around ,yes people spit and become single parents but they do not choose to do this, people in gay marriges choose to put any child they bring into there household in to an alien situation to be brought up by to people of the same genderfor there own whimsth this is child abuse and we only allow it to appease the namby pamby equal rights brigade, well what about the rights of the child to be brought up by a mother and farther.,,,,,,,,,,,,WE ARE GLASS",0,0
