"I am just going to repeat what I said before in different terms because I am not sure how I can make it any more clear.  A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. This is not the case with an inviable fetus.",1
"If God wanted women to have abortions, he would have invented fetuses that come with a little string attached, like tampons, so you can just pull them out ;)",0
"Yea, christians aren't perfect. But is anybody else? If you were responsible you would have done the right thing in the first place, but obviously if you are in the abortion state, you weren't responsible. If you aren't prepared for what might happen due to your own actions, then don't do it. If you don't risk mistakes then you wouldn't be put into the situation.",0
"I guess you were not man enough to match the video  Silent Scream  because that video clearly show a fetus doing what you say it can't; showing signs of awareness.  I also I didn't say""   few people have experienced abortion first hand "". What I said is that few really know what it is.  About being ""closed minded "" it doesn't matter what the thing looks like. ""  If it looks human and genetically it's human; it probably is human.  The question still remains unanswered: What kind of being is it? Your attempt to redefine the question hasn't changed the question, nor does it answer it. And a question not properly answered doesn't go away. That's why abortion is still a hot topic 35yrs after Roe vs Wade. There are a lot of people for whom something seems dreadfully wrong and for those of you who support abortion to dismiss us with some fancy mental gymnastics is simply inadequate. So please, answer the question.  You also lose credibility with statements like these"" the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks. "" How do you abort something you don't know you have? In most cases it's a missed period that tips the woman off and that takes time. Facts are annoying things when they contradict you and you can't make them go away by changing them. Do your research first before you make assertions like this, Because for those of us who have. you lose credibility. But I think you make my point that most people don't know much about abortion.   But tell me iamdavidh, were you ever an unborn baby? Because if you were. you have to acknowledge that an abortion would have killed you, not something else but you. And that means abortion kills people in the early stages of their life not something else that later becomes them, but them.",0
"Yes. I'm siding with abortion cuz it is never just Yes or NO. A lot of wrong things happen. But, they happen for the right reasons. To you killing a baby is all that is visible. I do not say your wrong. I cannot tell you are right either. What kinda solution do you come with if going further is dangerous and not to is equally dangerous.   I'm not going to say that there is never a choice. There always is a choice. Look... Sometimes, giving birth to a baby is risky. It might mean the mother's life too...    What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   Yeah.. Give birth to it then, when it can fully understand the meaning of pain and let it die. While you could have saved it all the pain. All that torture. Like... We had a nuclear tragedy in India. The birth effects are just preposterous. Kids died when they reached the age of 1 or 2. The mothers were denied of abortions, not by the hospitals but the family members. Some of the women weren't healthy enough for the birth process and hence they died. Even today Women are forced despite their health conditions.  I do not say it is right. But, it is never just a Yes or a No. There are always issues. There must be exceptions. To certain things. Certain 'unavoidable' things.  I agree with everything that you mention. It isn't wrong. But, I only mean to emphasis on those few things that stand importance too.",1
"My penis has all the DNA in it to make a life. It is a very complex organ. It can feel pain and often has a mind of its own. It reacts to sounds and temperatures as well as the sight of something it likes. It will be heartbreaking for me to lose it, so it's a difficult choice for me. But if I want to get rid of it, it should be my choice and not anybody else's choice!",1
"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.  It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.",1
"I'm not sure this statment proves an unborn childs sapience. Its not all that refreshing either. Yes a fetus is alive. But 'alive' means nothing, it has no greater self-awareness.   Also just because it doesn't need ""anything added to it"", it doesn't mean it proves your point.",1
"Not only do I think that it is wrong for the government or any type of law to prevent a woman from having the choice, but I also don't think that it's really the same as murder per se to abort a fetus. They're really not the same thing at all.",1
"I am antichoice abortion. I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   If not then you enslave someone from doing something with their body. So you are anti-choice. So why do you fault me for being antichoice abortion?  I believe that science established the fact that the life in the womb is a separate human being from its mother. It does not share organs…does not have the same finger prints…etc. It is simply using the space to grow. It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother. It was her body also that invited the sperm into the space where conception took place. She is the one who knew what could happen….when she had sex. She took the risk. She should be responsible for what happens. It was her risk and fault…not the unborns.   I am forced everyday to do things I don't want to do. I hate seat belts…but I am forced by law to wear them. And texting in the car. Who should have the right to stop someone from doing this if they are careful. Its their phone…its their car. THEY TAKE THE RISK JUST LIKE THE WOMAN DOES WHEN SHE HAS SEX. We all live by rules many we don't like. I do not like abortion.  I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear. Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion. Pro in the sense THEY WANT ABORTION LEGAL….WHICH MEANS BABIES DIE. That is not pro-life…even if they would never get one themselves. I go to conventions and seminars with Right to Life. If you stood up and said…..""I am pro-choice but I am against abortion""…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.  Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?  I am not happy. I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold. For me its like looking into the eyes of evil.  Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position. Try it…..",1
"It is neither right nor wrong. I agree that the latest time to have an abortion should be reduced. In the UK it currently stands at 24 weeks, which is also an age a baby can survive.   I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy. If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that? I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice.  At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask? Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)?  My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating. If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet? We would be in a massive state of poverty, much more drastic than we see now.",1
"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.  2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.  3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.  4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.  5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?",0
"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage.   Well, that's totally goofy and wrong. Married women get pregnant all the time. (Oh and here's a total shocker: not all married women  want  to get pregnant.) And of course if your spouse has an STD and you have sex with your spouse, you can catch it.  Nor does abstinence ""provide 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy,"" since rape and child molestation do happen.  And finally, there are a great many ""questions when it comes to abortion"" -- including the safety and wellbeing of the woman, the privacy of family decisions, the right to bodily autonomy, the state's interest in the life and health of its citizens, the relative value that should be placed on the life of the developing being, and the stage of development at which such value should attach or be assessed -- just to name a few off the cuff.",1
"The debate is not about whether or not abortion is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a pregnant woman carry a child to term. There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy. There are even more reasons a woman may choose to abort that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the woman and her doctor apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of abortions performed when there are better options? People like me who abhor abortion need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.",1
"I didn't say anything about ignoring science when creating laws. However, I asked why should we let it have a role. Ah, I see, b/c science is proven. Why is it proven? Ah, b/c science says so. In essence, your position is not much different then the religious fanatic, a complete reliance on your senses as opposed to complete reliance on an idea. You trust that your senses are all there is in this world. Many don't. And science doesn't prove that the natural is the only thing, it only can speak about the natural.   Besides, every law isn't based on a ""proven theory"". I'm not allowed to steal from you. What does that have to do w/science?  Thankfully, I'm not one of those who think this nation was founded as a Christian Nation. However, I certainly know a bit about those founding fathers, and know they certainly believed in a Creator, and that belief influenced the founding of this country.",1
a spider is not human life therefore it is not as precious for it does not have a soul and i for one usually don't kill spiders unless they are of harm!,0
"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.    Abortion  is  a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'?   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.   It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.  Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.",1
So it is OK to carry guns on campus' but not to have an abortion? Wow what a concept. Need I say more?   Sorry hit wrong one.,0
"You're the one who used God to support your debate actually. So yes, if you'd like to bring God into it then everyone else will assume this is a fair topic.  Christians forever believe that God chooses when a persons life begins and ends, so yes technically God decides to end the life of millions of unborn babies, that's if you choose to believe the Bible and Christianity teachings as the divine truth.",1
I am really against abortion. I know that most of the abortions are cause by the teens because they aren't prepared to raise a child. First of all i don't think thats a good reason to kill a baby. There are always other options not just that. I come from a family of 10 people and my mom raised us all by her self aborting never crossed her head. So what I'm basically trying to say is that aborting is not a way to solve things so i think it should just be illegal.,0
"But you are siding with the side that is pro-abortion. The child in the womb is never at fault, never deserves to be dismembered alive. It does not matter what excuse you can come up with...the unborn does not deserve it. But people like you side against life for reasons that YOU THINK are good enough for it to be killed.   You advocate death for the child of the mother who is mentally imbalanced. You said she might damage her baby should she be allowed to continue the pregnancy. You care more about the ""what if's"" than what actually might happen. What do you think abortion is? Why not take the chance that she might not harm the baby? You want to kill it by abortion anyway...this is a violent act.   What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   A woman does have a choice. Allow the unborn a chance at life by doing what is right, or kill it and be responsible for ending anothers life because of selfish reasons, which is morally wrong.",0
"""It is not what is physically there in the womb which is at issue. Rather, it is the fact that this living thing inside the mother has input within it the POTENTIAL to grow""   You forget that denying its life is not a precursor for murder. The whole concept is weather its ethical to deny someones potential to exist before that unborn being has a choice of its own.   However the belief resides in the fact that if that unborn being never comes into existence in the first place, it cant make a choice nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and inamite being as rights are exclusivly to the living, not the living of the future.   "" It is this instinct to develop, this fight to survive, to perpetuate itself which is beautiful and precious""   That is emotional and poetic reasoning",1
"Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   No, of course each person has his own opinion, but most of people judge other people. A lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion. But everybody has to have own opinion. I have mine, as well as you have yours.    Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?   Hey, there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant. I wrote it just as an example, because I know one girl who was in that situation.    Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.   Well, you would, but there are a lot of people who wouldn’t accept responsibility. As I said, I know someone who was in that situation, and it was really hard for her to make a choice.    Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Yes it is a good option, but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption, when you gave a birth to him, when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months. Also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period. It is not so easy to be pregnant ‘alone’ (if we are talking about that bad situation)   Yes, people should think before having sex, but everybody makes mistakes. And everybody solves their problems as they can. Somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby, but somebody cannot. It is their choice. :)   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   You confused me. )) I didn’t get you. I didn’t mean lawful, or unlawful. I meant that by abortion people kill their babies.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.   A privilege? Don’t know. I think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good.   Everybody can be wrong. Do you agree with that? We cannot live without mistakes. It teaches us how to be better, by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong, or something like that.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   I agree with you, that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes. But there could be different situations, when people cannot control them. Somebody are not wise enough, somebody doesn’t think before doing something. But life is intended for us to self-perfection. It is a life. We learn from the mistakes of a lifetime. Somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something, somebody can understand from the mistakes of others. People are different. That is why our life is very interesting. :)   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   In our society it wouldn’t be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldn’t be punished. Of course they should be punished. But in my opinion they should be punished only be God. But our society wouldn’t accept it, and I understand why. We are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that, because it is a good way for other people to live quietly. So that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail, for example. They are also people. They just make more serious mistakes like murder, or something.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really fixit?   I think it is. In any case, it would be better then doing nothing, right? The most important thing when you understand you mistakes. Of course, a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed. :) it is impossible physically, but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too I think. Have you seen the film “Seven pounds” with Will Smith? This film describes what I am talking about very good. He killed 7 people, and it was his mistake. But after that he helped 7 other people. I understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it.    If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Yes, in my opinion, it is a best solution, but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example, you cannot give the money back to him. In that case, you can give them to somebody who needs it. may be for charity? )   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.   Yes, it is a good option, of course. But there are several options: to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself, to give him to an adoption agency, or to have an abortion. (there can be some other options, I don’t know). But each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions.    If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.   A agree with you. But there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves, that is why we have a lot of options.   Of course, I wouldn’t have an abortion, because I love children and I want them, but I do not exclude it. If I would in a situation I described earlier, I would do it. But in other cases I wouldn’t.   But abortion is not wrong.   Abortion is an option. Option which is judged by someone, which is supported by someone, which is not understandable by someone, but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other people’s opinions. And that is their choice.",1
I'd like to hear one.    about 2% (not an insignificant amount) of pregnancies are ectopic; ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester.   http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1101/ p1707.html,1
What is the difference between a viable fetus (and many so called viable babies die after being born after 24 weeks) at 24 weeks and a fetus at 23 weeks? Do you know for a fact that one at 23 weeks would not survive? My neice was born at 23 weeks. Most pro-aborts here would say it is fine to kill them at that gestational age.   And tell me atypican....what gives anyone the right to kill a human being at any gestational age?  Do you know much about fetal development? Take a look at this website...if you click on the date it will show you an actual 3-D picture.   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-week-by-week    This one is 16 months....   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-images-16-weeks    Baby can show facial expressions and can hold head erect.

"Destroying a fetus is like destroying a part of yourself. One's genes, blood and cells are within the body of a their fetus, yet they undergo an abortion and prevent a human life from being lived. A fetus does not deserve to be denied life, because the fetal stage is probably is the stage of life where we are morally the most neutral. We cannot think for ourselves, nor can we comprehend good or bad. On this basis, infants are also considered innocent. Why deny life to something that does not deserve such a fate?",0
"It is, but just for the record I don't think people should get abortions based on that possibility. I meant to point out the potential quality of a fetus's life is not really part of the argument.",1
"Dear opponent, let me ask YOU a question.. do you even know how to debate?!  In a PROFESSIONAL debate, you do not attack any opponent but attack the argument.. I suggest you concentrate on attacking the argument instead of attacking the opponent next time..    Don't change the topic.   First of all, i do not follow any religious groups and personally i think that that information about condoms is just ridiculous and built on ignorant opinions..   You identify as Muslim, which is a religious group, and Muslim religious authorities have spread misinformation about scientific issues. The Catholics however are the primary offenders when it comes to issues of birth control misinformation.   Secondly, if i were to follow your ""style"" of debating, I'd say: You are acting irrationally and a person with no beliefs or morals.   Whether or not I have morals or beliefs is not the topic of this debate. You should be more concerned with my statement about imposing your morals and beliefs upon others.   Third of all, exactly as you said, these are my beliefs and morals and as i said only God decides the fate of all mankind, so i am simply sharing my point of view and debating. I am not forcing anything on anyone and every person is free to follow what they believe...   It is often best to not base a position on beliefs but instead form a position from data and evidence, that way you can form an unbiased solution for dealing with the problem at hand. If you take a random handful of people, and ask them how they feel about abortion, they'll give you widely varying starting times for when it is killing an innocent life, ranging from conception to birth. However there is only one true answer, and this is why science is important here.   Yes i am. In the case where a woman practices unsafe sex and does not want a pregnancy to occur, there are certain pharmaceutical drugs that should be taken between 48 - 72 hours after intercourse.. Otherwise, expect anything..   Fertilisation begins 3 weeks after intercourse. About 50% of abortions occur before the zygote becomes an actual foetus, and about 40% occur before the foetus has a developed heart.   Is she really? As i mentioned in an earlier argument, by keeping quiet she is the one allowing herself to go through all this pain.. She may be scared but if she thought of the consequences of keeping quiet - which is a pregnancy maybe - then she should realize keeping quiet isn't the wisest thing to do.. You speak up, you get help and there would be no reason for abortion anyway...   Yes. Getting an abortion is a form of personal responsibility.  Do you have trouble understanding rape? If a woman is raped, the social stigma of being pregnant is less important than the persistent reminder that your child is unwanted, forced upon you by a violent sexual act, and the offspring of the man who did this to you.  This is why using god as a basis of ethics and morality can lead to some very unrealistic solutions to simple problems.",1
"Because, you know, there isn't a surplus of orphans or anything. =/  Should women who don't want kids have them anyway out of guilt for people who can't?  ""and we have millions of people having sex and not being able to handle the consequences of pregnancy. if u have sex u better be ready to have babies too.""  That's stupid. Just..... stupid. So a woman should go out of her way to NOT solve a problem just because she got herself into it? If you tripped and broke your arm should you NOT get a cast on it just because you were foolish enough to trip? maybe you shouldn't have been walking if you weren't ready to handle the possibility of breaking your arm. Maybe you should of had the good sense to wear a bubble-wrap suit. No? Why does that backwards logic only apply to abortion then?",1
"This is my argument for all the pro-lifers out there:  Pro-lifers argue that all human beings, born or not, have human rights. And with those human rights comes the right to live.

But in the instance that the unborn child is harming the life of the mother, the pregnancy is terminated. So in this case, the unborn child is then stripped of its human rights, and the mothers rights trump the unborn child's.   So which is it, pro-lifers? Does an unborn child have human rights or doesn't it?",1

An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization.

"First of all it is sad that you would call talking about the life of a human being bullshit. Shows you are losing control...or did not have it from the beginning. One can disagree with something and not use profanity.   I have shown by posting here what SCIENCE SAYS ABOUT LIFE AND WHEN IT STARTS. This has nothing to do with religion. As I have said...one need not even bring God into the equation to see that abortion is wrong.   Now what I find amusing is this....You say the woman has the right that its her body and she should be able to do with it what she wants. Then you turn around in some self-righteous way...and take this away from the woman in the third trimester. LMAO  Is there something wrong with abortion iamdavidh? You must think so or your views wouldnt be like this. Do you know anything about fetal development? You want to enslave a woman to pregnancy....you want to take her right to her body away. Shame on you.   For your information....no child at birth could survive without intervention. And even children born at full term might need medical assistance. What difference does it make whether that medical assistance takes place at 22 weeks....38 weeks or when its born?  If anyone is contradictory, inhumane, compassionless, cold, empty...as far as their worldview is....its you not me. I simply want to protect human life, the human life that is defenseless against people like you who pain a bullseye on their forhead and want them dead.   You are a blamer......you whine and you put the blame places to make yourself feel good about your lack of doing anything for anyone. Why should it be my responsibility to solve the worlds problems? What about personal responsiblity? You're a Democrat aren't you? You are the psychotic one, not me. I work at crisis pregnancy centers and I work at Right to Life and with a group, Silent No More. I do my share. What do you do for mankind besides complain?   I am crusading for life and for personal responsiblity. And if you knew anything about abortion, you would see that your last comment is absurd. Why don't you go to the Guttmaucher site on abortion and educate yourself, so you don't look so silly.",0
"The frightening thing about the abortion debate in this country is that not enough attention is brought to the fact that white men often have the strongest opinion on the matter.  While I am in NO way religious, I understand that some people are religious, and that abortion goes against their beliefs.

For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?  That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment.

"Your argument fails in that a human who has been born, whether freed or enslaved, is a life in being -- i.e., someone who is an autonomous life fully developed to the point of not being physiologically dependent on another being for basic bodily functions.

"Since you haven't disputed my other arguments on the other end, I shall simply respond to this one.   If having a child would be burden, then having sex is a terrible idea.   Which says absolutely nothing about abortion is morally right or wrong.   Sex is intentional.   Obviously, sex involves two parties. Thus, your idea of whether sex is intentional or not would depend on whose perspective you are taking.   In nature, it is meant to result in fertilization. It is not an ""accident,"" it is what is supposed to happen.   Again, you are misconstruing what can be considered an ""accident"". Just because it occurs ""in nature"" doesn't mean that it is not an accident. An earthquake could be natural. And it could be natural for buildings to collapse during an earthquake event. It could even be that the debris of the collapsing buildings kill people and cause other loss of property. However, does it necessarily mean that it is not an accident.",1
"mmb98, they were only quoting the Declaration of Independence. And I assume this discussion is for legality in America? So really the argument doesn't crumble at the beginning at all. In fact, it starts at the beginning, of this country.   And an interesting idea, life before liberty. B/c the pro-abortion crowd considers themselves ""pro-choice"", but they deny life in order to have choice. Do you think they'd agree if we deny their life for one of my choices?",1
"Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life.   When it comes to rape, women can have choice to abort or not abort. I support either decision. However, it is immoral to abort always. I also believe it is selfish.   If you are just careless, don't abort. It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault. Why not the man's fault too? Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.   But this topic is pointless. Selfish or not, a murderer will kill, a rapists will rape, a ""abortionist"" will abortion. What are you going to do? Keep an eye on the woman? You can and i believe you are doing a good deed. But i am not going to spend the rest of my life watching over a woman and stopping her from getting an abortion EVERY time. It is sad what i have said. That i won't help. But i have a life and this is not what i want to do with my life. To put this in short, if a woman wants to get an abortion, SHE WILL GET AN ABORTION.   I believe adoption is a good option. And i believe it should be an only option. My opinion is similiar to ColdFire.   This is my opinion. I am Pro And Con. Im ProCon. And im not yelling. :)  Edit. Im an idiot. It is both the man's fault and the woman's fault for the woman getting pregnant. What was i thinking?",0

"Firstly, just because abortion was illegal up until the early 70s does not mean women weren't having it done. It's an archaic procedure - the earliest recorded abortion was in Egypt, 1550 BCE. And they'll continue to do it in the future. You just need to get over it. Secondly, you can be both. You can believe in abortion under the right circumstances.    ""It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act... and abortion is the next.""   Could you be anymore heartless? The mother never  asked  to be victimized, so if she chooses abortion, it's more of an act she was  forced  into, not one she decided upon of her own volition. Why wouldn't you call the man who raped her a murderer, in essence? And let's consider for a moment the victim decided to keep her child - what do you think she may one day tell him/her when they continually ask where their father is? ""Honey, you were a mistake and your father brutally raped me in a dark alley somewhere?"" Yeah, kudos for Father of the Year! In this case, he would have victimized  two  people instead of just one.   ""No birth control is 100% effective... unless you get fixed.""   Are you honestly suggesting people  not  have sex from fear they might get pregnant? Go shout that in the town square, see how many agree. I agree, people should practice safe sex, but if they take all necessary precautions and get pregnant anyway, and decided for whatever reason the time isn't right, they're entitled to an abortion.",0
"I would go as far as saying that before the fetus can digest milk (which means it can be sustained without direct connection to the mother via the umbilical cord), it is a dependent part of the mother like any other organ and she should have the choice to remove it. After that, society could have a say (because society can theoretically keep it alive with milk).",1
"""Abortion truly is one of the great travesties of modern times. Millions of murders have been committed by misguided women who have been convinced that ending the life of their innocent child is alright.""   Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.    How can you live with yourself murdering so many cells throughout your lifetime?    ""Life is an ever-progressing journey. It has a beginning and an end. We as humans are constantly changing. I, at the age of 20, am not the same person I was 2 years ago. When I am 40 I will not be the same person. We are constantly growing from the moment of conception until the moment we breathe our last breath.""   However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.   ""To cut life off at any moment in this contingency that we call ""life"" is murder. We know that human life technically begins at conception. That's all that needs to be said.""   For black and white thinkers such as yourself, that's all that you can understand. You lack a deep understanding of what life exactly is.  Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.  Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.   ""What I cannot stand are those who hide behind woman's rights. This is ridiculous. A little while ago, I created my very own you-tube video on this very issue.

By letting political groups take over this very important right of a woman over her own body, you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.  Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life, and unless each and every sperm is conserved for female impregnation, you were committing murder.",1

"She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either   Why don't you respond to my posts? I've said this before but woman do take measures to not get pregnant by using contraception. Contraception  fails . I got pregnant on the contraceptive pill which I took correctly, it happens (I didn't abort by the way, but it's just an example). Or do you consider contraception killing of a potential child too?   The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame..   Wow , you're one hell of a sexist! Why does a woman have to take sole responsibility of a pregnancy? How dare you say no one else to blame! The man is just as responsible for the action of sex and creating a life yet he wouldn't get your giant speech on the immorality or creating unwanted life. Not once in the whole discussion have you ever mentioned the males role in creating a baby just how terrible the woman is.   Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body   She was  conceived  in a test tube. She didn't spend 9 months on a petri dish growing. Her embryo was placed into a womb and relied on a woman's organs to live. Your statement is all wrong.   If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not   The man is not the issue? Do you realize how many woman get abortions because the person who impregnated them pressured them into doing so? The men often  want  the woman they got pregnant to abort. He is just as responsible for creating the life as she is and if  wants  her to abort then he is just as responsible for the termination.",1

I can survive outside the uterus with a self-sustaining internal circulation, an embryo is underdeveloped to do that.  //If every unborn child voted, how would it go?//  Wow, we don't legally allow minors to vote, but let's ask the differentiated cells in an uterus to decide what the owner of the reproductive organ should do with her body, eh?",1
"If abortions haven't got a feasible reason to exist then why do they happen? Do you think it's a fun past-time for the people who have to go through it?

Abortions DO have really good reasons to exist, that is why they continue to exist, you just haven't opened your mind to our side of the issue. But that's ok, cos we're not interested in forcing you to do what we do, stop trying to force us.  About killing a fetus, I know this may sound a little heartless to you but I'd still like to see you argue this properly: Why shouldn't we kill fetuses? We can make fetuses all the time (some people can't but this doesn't concern them), the human population in the world continue to grow and if overpopulated, we'd be in crisis mode because of food shortages and environmental destruction. We don't owe fetuses anything! If we want to have kids and give them a chance to contribute to society as well as carry on our genetic heritage then we can keep the fetuses, but if we don't want kids, we can just get rid of the fetuses, we don't need to consider if the fetuses have committed a crime or not, we don't need any excuse at all. Hell, they can't commit crimes.",1
"Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.  According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised. And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus. How is this psssible if the fetus is a parasite? And how does the human body not fight against the fetus but rather undergo changes to accept the fetus?  Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?  Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.",0

"Really? Then if it's about a woman's right to control her own body, then why is it that the laws forbid her from controlling her own body when it comes to prostitution or the use of drugs?

Doesn't these have to do with everybody's right to control their own body too?",0
Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on? Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law. Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well. Whether you are dealing with science or business etc at some point you will have to abide by the instructions of the laws.  And again debating my friend is based on facts and research not just what you think.,0

"Abortion should be legal.As someone has already said,women have the right to their own body and if a baby needs to be terminated then so be it.  Especially if any women have gone through rape or any hard situation and it causes pregnancy then its the mothers choice.Especially if the baby wasn't wanted or was a mistake.",1
"Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent? If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience. Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep? after all you will eventually demonstrate sapience when you wake up, which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience. well sleeping your moments are similar to the kicking a fetus may have, they are not a demonstration of sapience. The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?    If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it. combine that with the complications above and this seem to be quite muddled. So the question seems to me to be more of weather our laws and philosophies behind them should be consistent and if they are not then it is not principles but rather utility they are based on. In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.",0
"1. Just as my fingernails and hair do not make up the whole of a human, so too a fetus does not make up the whole of a human. They do have equal feelings, emotions and understanding on the matter though.  3. It is in every way part of the mother. It is a cluster of cells with no feelings, emotion of ability to be self-aware growing within her. And wether it is alive is not the point at all. It is not even close to the point. The point is whether it is self-aware and capable of feeling, which it definitely, without any doubt, is not.  4. No, you're imagining a human where there is none. I'm giving you fact you're giving me your personal misguided feelings.  5. My claim is not based on genetic code or whether it's living. It's based on being self-aware.

I'll make you a deal, when you have the omniscient ability to know exactly what every female and fetus on earth is thinking and feeling and you can prove to me you have this ability, then if fetuses stop dying of natural causes all on their own magically, I'll agree with your self-righteous nosy bullshit.",1
"""Extra Bunch of Cells?""  Maybe not to the same extent as, say, scraping the inside of your cheek or scratching a layer of epidermis with your fingernails, but they lack any human fetus or vertebrae features until well into 3 months of development. Otherwise, what you'd see under a microscope really would just be unremarkable ""cell"" reproduction.     I'm sure what Hollow more accurately meant to say was ""blastocyst,"" which is really just a scientific term for the pre-fetus stage of conception in which the developing embryo really IS just a clump of cells that begin reproducing after the fertilized ovum has attached itself to the uteran wall. For the technical definition, see:  Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.

"Go back to my previous post and find the part where I said something to the effect of the following: ""No woman has ever experienced any negative emotions after getting an abortion.""  If you can do that, your response won't have been mostly a waste of time.    How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals.   You wouldn't have to ask this if you read the source I provided. How did researchers reach the conclusion that most women feel relieved after an abortion? They asked them. They administered surveys to women who underwent abortions and asked them to explain how they felt about the process. 76% said they felt relieved. The data doesn't agree with your stance, learn to deal with it.    http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/ Phil%207570%20Website/aAdler1990.pdf     I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.   You know people who have regretted abortions, so it's impossible that most abortion patients are okay with their procedure? This is blatantly biased. Your subject group is heavily skewed: women who are happy with their abortions obviously won't come looking for abortion healing so they're not nearly as visible to you. It's fallacious to assume your experience is representative of everyone's.   For the women who do feel guilt or depression: how much of that is owed to the prevalence of the idea that they  should  feel terrible for getting abortions? If family and/or society is unsupportive or hostile to women who choose abortion, or if they're even perceived that way, doesn't it make sense for at least some of them to be negatively impacted by that?

"So you are 48? I was right? You can't keep that part out!?! For your birthday, I'll get you an upvote. Perhaps we should stop this discussion on the abortion debate, we are cluttering it with stuff useless to the topic.  For the abortion argument:  Are they humans? Would you kill a newborn baby? What is the difference?",0
I wish more people were as mature as you.,1
The option of putting up a child for adoption should always be made available but not compulsory.,1
"""""Life"" please specify what you mean by the word ""life"".   Sorry what I was referring to was sapience  ""Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.""  What I am trying to get across is that soul is a concept. It’s symbolic of sapience. The concept of soul is key to the philosophical and religious debate about unborn children.   ""Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.""  I was not talking about free will; I am talking about free thought. Free will is the decision to create your own perspective. Free thought defines ones ability to influence its own mindset, create decisions that are not based on instinctual behaviour.   That argument just goes out the window because I did not once mention free-will which is a different concept. The exact phrase I used was “free thinking”.   I feel as if you’re dancing around the concept a bit. I said an unborn baby can’t make any decisions at all, it is completely imamate. Just like a rock, a twig, a leaf, they make no decisions and are only influenced by nature. Yet you’re carrying on about our own free-will.  Yes free-will in the form we know it is an illusion. Our world is only moving in one direction and there is hardly any relativity. However you defeat yourself by saying that statement at all, you deny your own spiritual existence. If you had no free will you would not have wrote that sentence in the first place.   Free-will has no black and white definition. Because if free-will existed I would to be able to do whatever I wanted when I wanted with no consequences but I am restricted to living the life I was giving because of the circumstances of this world. However what you must understand is that free-will is the foundation of our sapience. Without it we are inanimate beings. A mere shell with no occupant.   Most people against abortion are religious fanatics which is why this kind of discussion is appropriate. But you clearly are not. What are you? Are you pro-choice or pro-life or what. It feels like you are dancing between the two.  You made a discussion about sapience and then made a double standard about me not having proof of the existence of a soul?  Also you should debunk my other statements before falsifying my entire arguments in a few short paragraphs.",1
"It`s not a fetus.It has 46 human chromosomes, it’s a male or a female, and it’s complete, meaning nothing else will be added to it, just growth and development.   You keep using the word foetus, do you even have a deeper understanding of what a foetus is?",1

Contradiction!   So, my suggestion is not ridiculous. YOU are ridiculous. YOUR arguments are ridiculous. YOU should go live in a country run by dictatorship. YOU should deal with YOUR unwanted pregnancies in YOUR OWN way.  Leave it alone. Abortion should not be banned.",1
"Look at it this way: should a human life suffer because of the mistakes of their parents? I mean, you're saying a human shouldn't suffer death because the parents conceived the child against their wills. My issue is, a) a fetus isn't a human and I have a hard time with people comparing fetus's to a newborn with a brain. b) The consequences of those parens having a child when they can't even afford to take care of it, not just financially, but probably mentally and emotionally, only leads for that child, with feelings, and a current life, to suffer. I think they're two totally different things: fetus vs child. I understand the empathatic thoughts of abortion, but I believe it hurts a hell of a lot more seeing kids abused and abandoned than it does to see a fetus aborted.",0
I feel sorry for you. I hope you will realize the evilness of your abortions.,1
"You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will. Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God. No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world. It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity. You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin. You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible. I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type. Like I said earlier, leave the judging to God.",0
"In my opinion it is wrong, because you kill a baby, even if he was not born. We have to save lives, but not to kill them. Also, it is inmoral according to philosophy. In addition, it harms to the health of woman. Even in future this woman cannot have any babies.",0
Saying something is proper justification doesn't make it so. You first have to prove that it is and that you haven't done. You've only dismissed it's humanity. . If it is only a sperm or egg it is indeed alive but not fully human seeing it lacks the full chromosome set. But once it fertilizes and the chromosome set is complete; it's fully human. Either it's fully human and alive or it's not. I don't see any other option and the potential life argument doesn't factor in at all.  Again we are talking about the proper justification of taking human life; rabbit trails don't interest me.  About hassling; I will defend the innocent at my own expense; even if it cost my life because that's the right thing to do and it's always right to do what is right.,0
"I'm kinda in the middle.  I don't think raped women should be forced to have their babies, if they get pregnant.  And also, I think we should prioritize the mother instead of the child. If the mothers life is in danger if she has the baby, I think she should abort the baby.",1

"Abortion is a way to prevent more poor families, suffering children, and used as back up when birth control fails.  I don't think anyone who used protection in sex should be saddled with a child.

"After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both.",0
"I made 2 very clear points for you to argue, but again you've gone and taken the scenic route all over the countryside, what's more, you've actually missed the 2 sights you were supposed to visit, here I'll number for you so you won't miss them:  1 - Abortions have good reasons to exist, that's why they exist.  2 - We can remove fetuses if we want and we don't need any excuses. It's not the same as killing people. We're not in shortage of fetuses in the world.   Now, focus! Don't go past ""Go"" nor collect $200 dollars (referencing the family game Monopoly) until you've talked about these 2 points. Then if you want to make another point, do so in a different post.",1
"Abortion should NOT be legal. There are countless women in this world that can't have children or are struggling to concieve...women should deliver the babies - and allow the child to live a life. Just because 2 adults are not ready to care for a child doesn't mean that abortion is the only option.   As a mother, I know how much joy my son has brought me...and believe me - if there is a woman out there that doesn't want their child - there are equally as many women out there that are dying to have one. Allow your child to be loved if not by you, then by another family.",0
"Take this hypothetical.   A woman, her child and a doctor are out hiking in no mans land and they have an accident (a fall lets say). The child is injured. He needs a blood transfusion and the mother and child are the same type (the doctor is not).   The doctor explains the risks to the mother - the child needs a lot of blood and he has no way to measure how much is being taken... there is a risk she will loose too much blood and die.  She agrees  He hooks her up, so she is supporting the childs life. After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded, and gets scared. She decides she doesn't want to do this anymore - she has 2 other children at home that need her.  Does she have the right to unhook herself? The child will surely die. Of course she does, it's legal, and nobody has ever tried to make it illegal. Even after agreeing, and being hooked up, she can change her mind.   So if a women gets pregnant, and the fetus is hooked up to her, why does she have to stay hooked up? At some point between her and the fetus the umbilical is part of her body. Does she not have the right to disconnect it if she feels she is not up to going through with it?  Why would a women be legally required to keep her fetus alive by allowing it access to her body, but has no legal requirement that she keep her child alive after it is born (even if there is 0 risk to her life)? A women has a right to not have her body used by someone else.",1
"Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted, you probably would care.   We wouldn't care. We couldn't.  As a fetus the natural drive humans have for survival really isn't there. The mental capacity just wouldn't exist to care.",1

A lot fewer, and we'd have less poverty, slums, crime and overpopulation if people aborted rather than raise a child unprepared.",1
You kept saying that abortion is right? Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible? You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care. To me that is just childishness. How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest? If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion? Who looks more silly? Me or you? You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice? Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics. Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence. Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.   Try answering my questions and then we can continue this debate because i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance. If you are so skillful in researching the field of abortion then do me a favor and respond to the following questions;  When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.  Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?  What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?  How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?  Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?  If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts. If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified. Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.,0
yeah so people have the right to decide. certain things happen in life and some people may not be able to support a baby. if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child? i wouldn't. plus some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life. it's simply not our choice to decide what people want to do with their bodies and if they feel it is not killing someone then it is not on our plates it is on theirs.,1
"Also consider, that humans are the only species on earth that have 46 chromosomes in our DNA structure. This DNA structure is truly what sets us apart from other species. 23 chromosomes are found in the sperm, and 23 in the egg. At the exact moment of conception those 23 come together to make 46, detailing not only that they are human, but who they will be. At the exact moment of conception, they are a human life, and no longer a couple of cells.

"That's called discrimination based on level of dependency   No, it's called discrimination based on level of development.

Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious   I'm not ignoring anything. I'm trying to clarify things for, apparently, a stubborn fool. A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever.  .   What you call ""potential"" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not.   You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points. Look up ""potential"" separately, then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this: I agree that it's life, I'm only making a distinction that it's potential. This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life, they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development. That's why it's a potential life. If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions.  .   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?   Don't quotemine my arguments for your benefit. I said we make laws to help us with our lives.

"I couldn't help but notice what a load of bulls  t you're capable of dishing out.  Firstly you're way off the topic of the debate. It's whether abortion should be banned! Not whether human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial. If people want to get rid of their fetuses it's their choice (whether it's sacrificial or not).   I suggest you save some of that energy to debating the topic. So far, all i've heard in the hundreds of arguments against abortion is that ""it's a person, don't commit murder""... which has been rebutted many times. So bring something original to the debate, don't dress up the same cr*p in different packaging.",1
"It definitely should be legal and be allowed for all women.  Everyone has the right on live. However, there is a question: Who is this «everyone», whether it is an adult, teenager, newborbaby or fetus in the womb?  or When, at what moment the human embryo becomes a person with the right to life?  It may be argued that the nervous system is the main function for life. However, up to embryonic day 14, embry has no central nervous system and, therefore, cannot be considered as a human being who has senses. Thus, it seems that an embryo is not human and abortion should not be considred as murder.",1

Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped? Do you think that if you walked into a hospital nursery and you were told that one babys mother had been raped...that you would be able to pick it out? Why does two acts of violence make sense? So the woman goes through the rape and then knowing she killed the child inside her. Do you know how mothers would cope with this extra trauma?   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die? Wow...how compassionate and materialist you are. ARe you perfect in appearence? Lets abort babies because they have problems.......Hitler had the same idea did you know that? He believed in killing the weak, the dredges of society. Again you are blaming the unborn for the sins of the parent. I have personally seen drug babies...and while they have a hard time at first...they can be saved and they can lead normal lives. You are making excuses for the killing.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks...the woman who wants to finish school, the woman who does know who the father is, the woman who does not want another child of that sex?

That you would speak for another human who cant speak for themselves, and choose death. You are choosing death...for all the ""what-if's""  What right do you have to determine how someone MIGHT LIVE?   What if you were poor....and the government said that everyone who made less than a certain amount couldn't have a child, that if you got pregnant you would have to abort because if you had one it would be a burdon on society.

"Abortion violates the NAP in that it causes harm to another living thing, and so I cannot support it.

"I'm not for making abortion illegal, but I am for legislation to discourage medical professionals from performing unnecessary medical procedures on pregnant women that result in the death of the developing fetus. So I will argue for Silaswash...since I guess he bailed.   people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.   It could be argued that it harms the public in general, by  1. Wasting valuable medical resources on unnecessary procedures  2. Encouraging indiscriminate sex  3. Promoting a culture of irresponsibility  It could mentally harm a father who had no choice but to bear the thought of his offspring being killed in it's most vulnerable state before it even had a chance.   fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible).   Moral agency! people don't get moral agency until they are old enough to experience regret. People who don't yet have moral agency still deserve legal protection.   The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents.   So how would you say a developing baby at the onset of the third trimester all of the sudden starts attributing value? Desperate attempts to justify the unnecessary killing of a fetus are invariably the result of such poor stretches of logic.   Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.    Morality applies any time an ugly and regrettable thing like an unnecessary abortion is performed.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.   So when do the father's rights to protect his developing child kick in?",1

So I think it's good as long as it is the beginning of pregnancy, but just before giving birth.",1

"Regardless of a biased opinion of whether abortion is 'shameful' or not, abortion should absolutely be legal. A woman has rights to her own body, as do men to their own. It is arguable that it is 'killing' or 'murdering' a creature, but you cannot end something that hasn't ever been started. Women's rights to their very own bodies should not be violated because of less open minds. It should never be a question that women are unaffected by the choices they make every day. I conclude with, it is only the choice of the maker of the decision, and that decision is none other than the person that is in direct control of it, especially if it directly effects the health of a one persons body.",1

"1. Your fingernails and hair do not make up the whole of you as a human. Without your hair or fingernails you would survive. On the contrary, abortion kills the entire individual organism.  2. That whole issue is inconsequential.  3. Science is silent on the issue of morality. However science does agree that the fetus has an individual genetic code and fits into the biological definition of life. It is an individual human by all biological standards. It is in no way a part of the mother, it just depends on the mother for survival (and so are children outside the womb). Because of this it is deserving of all human rights everyone else has. Unless you can show it is not an individual human or it is not alive, anything else is superfluous.  4. You're just stating the positive side of the coin whereas I said the negative.  5. You're refusing to answer the basic data over and over. Please share how a human fetus is not alive or how it is not an individual with a unique genetic code.",0
"No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it.   It is both.   Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion.   That is obviously a hasty generalisation. I would think that in many cases, babies born with fatal birth defects or, at least, defects that can tragically affect their lives (such as cerebral palsy) will not experience an alleviation of their pain and suffering no matter who their parents are. How can you say that I am rushing to ridicule when you haven't even seen my perspective on this issue?   He presented an alternative that doesn't involve an unnecessary surgery and in which the life of the developing child is cherished instead of treated like trash.

"Oh jeez,   I don't know where you and that J whatever guy came from, but your critical thinking skills are absolutely awful on this topic.  My point about the thousands of potential lives every time a guy cums are accurate.  There are thousands of sperm, each ""potentially"" able to make a life if it finds an egg. This is every time a guy cums. Look it up. There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep. But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.  And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the ""potential"" life argument is.  Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion. Because, exactly... like... I... said... we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.  Now, reread this twice if you feel a need to reply, and consult a dictionary if you have to, I'm tired of having to over-explain the simplest things.",1

"Abortion is a disgusting thing. That's a fact.   No, it isn't. That is an opinion.    I see nothing wrong with working to reduce public acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control.   A little public shaming never hurt anyone, right?  I know we've been over this before and the conversation got to be too much for me to keep straight as much as it was interesting, so I'll try to keep this focused. You speak as if your definition of the 'unnecessary' is the one that matters. I'm sure you understand that many people actually getting abortions consider it absolutely necessary...and without understanding their circumstances, you're advocating public hostility towards their choice. What qualifies you to decide what is necessary and unnecessary for strangers, and what social punishment they should receive if they don't obey your standards?",1
"You are incorrect in stating, ""if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide."" You would only be charged with two counts of homicide if the prosecution can prove the baby could have survived outside of the womb. If a doctor were to provide an abortion after 24 weeks, he or she would also be charged with homicide (unless the baby would not have been viable or was a threat to the health of the mother).",1
"Yes contraception fails..........but that does not chance the facts. The woman knows it MIGHT fail...and chooses to do it anyway. The responsiblity is HERS.   I believe what science says...  Some people do not make a connection between birth control and abortion. You probably see them as two different acts. The fact is however that some birth control are abortifacients because they work by causing early term abortions. The IUD seems to prevent a fertilized egg a new human being from implanting in the uterine wall. The pill does not always stop ovulation, but sometimes prevents implantation of the growing embryo. And now we have the RU-486 pill that aborts a new fetus, a new baby.   I am not a sexist....you are, your pro-choice position is sexist. You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not. I believe they should have a say. I would bet you dont. So who is sexist? LOL  You want the woman to have her cake and eat it too. You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support. What rights does the father of this newly concieved child have? NONE. You give him none......I don't. The fact is....pregnancy takes place in the womans body. The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this. If you think he has and should be responsible.......THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD? You are the sexist one, not me.   Our government tells the father.......YOU ARE NOT IMPORANT until the child is born, whether you want it or not...then get out your wallet. The woman holds ALL THE CARDS...and your giving her a pity party.   My statement is right about Louise Brown. She was concieved in a petri dish....nothing the mother or father did...helped.   It's a scientific fact that the mother is one distinctive and self-contained person and the child is another. Being inside something is NOT the same as being part of something and ones body does not belong to another’s body merely because of proximity. Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried.   In July 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill making it illegal to execute a pregnant woman. The logical reason for this decision is that a preborn child is an individual person, distinct from his mother and with his own separate right to life. As I said our laws are wishy washy.   Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence should they? I am sure you would think that premature baby lying in a hospital incubator deserves to live. Would the exact same baby deserve to live any less because she was still in her mother?  But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   Your worldview is sad...........  You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic. I picket them...never seen one dragged in, not in ten years. No woman gets an abortion unless SHE CONSENTS. Place the blame where it belongs. It is her body she has the right to decide. There are places that would help her....I work in one.",0

"Ok, now you're being dramatic and it's not funny at all. If you're not a woman experiencing PMS then you really have no excuse, but if you are then calm down and see my point. It's really quite workable:  Ok, what I mean is make ""sex that results in an unwanted pregnancy"" illegal. Ok, unwanted pregnancy is the key. Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury. You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT. If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!!!! A hefty fine is a very good deterent. You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion. This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive. The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc... You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.  So, as with seatbelt wearing in a car, over a short period, people would all learn to do it responsibly and it will become second nature and not have to be such an issue. Don't make it illegal, regulate it and everyone's a winner.",1
Exactly i know why i made that statement. If the fetus does not have life then why does the state and the federal government institutes a charge of double homicide if the fetus dies through the death of the mother because according to those supporting abortion the fetus does not have life.

She CHOSE to have sex, knowing full well the possible ramifications of such an action.

"I would like to offer some clarification on the question ""can I kill it"" and the follow-up question ""what is it""  As I have stated before; the taking of human life requires a high level of justification. No argument that I've seen for abortion rises to the level of proper justification. Please note what I'm discussing; the taking of human life, not any life but human life in particular.   So what does that have to do with the question ""can I kill it"" That question needs to be clarified; hence the follow up question. What I want you to notice is what kind of question ""what is it"" is. It is an ontological question. We're asking about the very nature of the thing in question. And that's important because it determines how we answer the first question. But notice this is a strictly ontological question; it is not a question about level of dependence or development. Why is that important? Because if the thing in question, ontologically speaking, is human then it requires a high level of justification to kill it. If it's not human, no justification is necessary. I'm not saying if it's human you can't kill it, sometimes you can and must but you must properly justify your actions. This is were abortion fails because the only reason it gives for the most part is because the mother just choose to. And yes I'm sure she went through some tough decisions but bottom line; she wants to. Because the fact is she doesn't have to; she has other options.   But what happens when you kill without proper justification? You have to find a way to justify the act because your conscience is smitting you. This is always done by making the victim less than human or not human at all. Because after all if it's not human, no justification is necessary. And this is were I have seen all the arguments for abortion go. They leave the ontological question and move to other areas that are more easily justifiable. Most of them are framed like this:  can I kill it? What is it? it's just a..... Well of course you can  They all answer yes by qualifying the object by something that is easier to justify; a standard that is lower not higher. But let's answer the question head on and notice how the gravity of the question changes when we answer the follow-up question correctly. And by correctly I mean answering the question according to the kind of question it is, an ontological question.  can I kill it? What is it? It's a human, one at the very early stages of it's development......   So let's take the question of this debate head on; Should abortion be banned?   What is abortion?   The taking of a human life at the very early stages of it's development.   Why would you want to do that?   Because I don't want the inconvenience of a child.  Does that sound like proper justification for the taking of human life, especially the weakest and most vulnerable human life?  I have reduced, intentionally, all reasons for an abortion to a matter of convenience because ultimately that's what it comes down to. If a pregnancy, regardless of how it came about, stands between you and what you want it's an inconvenience; and we all know what we do with inconveniences. But this one is a little sticker because it's human. But if we can take away or cloud it's humanity then it will be easier to do.   So should abortion be banned? Of course it should, for obvious reasons.",0

"Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it. The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers. Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate. I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like  Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged  it makes it really difficult to continue.  Of course no one wants to get an abortion. Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something. What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes. Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions). I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.  I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother. We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb   I agree, and that's why I said that a viable fetus should be considered a full human being, however you choose again and again to ignore this fact.",1
"It seems we may of been arguing definitions  Free thinking and free will are synonyms to me; as is perspective and mindset. mindset can be seen as a perspective with a positive feedback loop.  The mind is a beautiful thing full of feedback loops and self modifying. It is bounded by its original state and its environment. If all one starts with in life is instinctual behavior then there is a chain of reaction in all their ""decisions"" which amount to them being based on instinctual behavior. I can write some javascript code which is selfmodifying in such a way which changes how it modifys itself based off of previous modifcations. The exact way to do this would take some time though. currently i'm working on a automatic logical analysis of statements to access their validity; which means i'm looking at their structure and seeing if there are any possible ways the premises could all be true and the conclusion false. I won't have much time to work on either one till summer though which is a roughly a month away. a self-modifying function which changes how it modifies based on previous modifications sounds like a challenge but i know its possible for programs have been evolved and not made before in other languages and thats essentially what i would be doing. i might work some on it but it won't be a high priority project. matter of fact i just found this site yesterday and i need to spend less time on it. I'm in love with argumentation, call it my addiction. i went on a tangent back to the different points.  My spiritual existence is only valid under determinism. This may require more explaining but might be best made a separate debate.  consciousness is an emergent property of a electro-chemical machine, it is the same as the polarity of water.   freewill and freethought both suggest that a human being can be a first cause that their decisions are neither random nor determined. A human being is not a god. Although god is an ambiguous word and in one sense i can say that, and in another sense i can say i am my own god. Perhaps god is a word which should be avoided in debate due to its ambiguity.  Abortion constitutes many other debates, it is a debate which rests upon many other debates. I have unique viewpoints upon those debates and i find most other people to be inconsistent when it comes towards abortion, on either side. I'm making a debate to see what the smaller issues are that might be debated best separately.",0

"Actually: I came up with my opinions of Abortion without the help of religion. I researched the topic independently, and tried to learn every angle that I could from BOTH sides. I'm pro-life in the definition of I think that every person should have equal opportunity to live, and that people should give the life as much chance to live as possible.  I think abortions that are NOT based on betterment for the woman or baby's health is wrong.   Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?  I care about all people in general having the chance to life their life to the fullest.  Not what people in the Bible said about it.  And abortion only prevents a child from being a 'bother' to their parents (unless it's for medical reasons). The parents decided to have sex knowing FULL WELL that they had the risk of having a child. But once they are met with the result of sex they want to bail out because they don't want to be inconvenienced with something THEY MADE.

"It is a degradation to you, perhaps. Others believe differently. Why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs? Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc. They  are  going to act on it. Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them?   Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example. A baby grows inside of you. So technically, it is a part of you. A part of your body. You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to. This is why a ban on abortion would fail.   We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to. No woman comes to it lightly. When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness. Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term. Others because they know they cannot financially support the child. Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to. Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make. So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference.   As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim?    From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education:     Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people. The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs  can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk  of HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programs  do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity  or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents.  By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.   The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or “abstinence- plus”) sex education is the proven effective choice. Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated.",1

"Right and Wrong cannot be simply measured on some sort of scale, no amount of good deeds wipes out a single sin even something as simple as telling a lie, which is not on a level with abortion",0
"......GOD will forgive because that is who he is a forgiving FATHER  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin (Psalm 51:1-2).  Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me (Psalm 51:9-10).  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives. My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One (1 John 1:9-2:1).  so i guess it is your own opinion of what you think of it.  so god bless you all AMEN",1
"This is nothing but hacky, sickening propoganda manufactured to instill guilt and fear in anyone considering abortion.  A one, two, three, etc. month old fetus isn't thinking  anything , much less babbling to itself about how much it loves its mommy. The most conservative estimates put fetus's the ability to feel pain at 20 weeks, a date after which abortions are incredibly rare, and likely to be for reasons of an inviable fetus or the mother's health. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_abortion_by_gestational_age_2004_histogram.svg  )  Even this assertion, notably used in pro-life legislation (  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18785-briefing-new-law-claims-a-fetus-can-feel-pain.html  ) trying to whittle down the likelihood of a woman getting abortion by any means possible (scrupulous or not) is debated by evidence from various studies that place the ability to feel pain at 24-26 weeks.   http://theweek.com/article/index/204531/                                        can-fetuses-feel-pain    The ability to form any semblance of consciousness probably comes well after pain response, making this piece of chain mail nothing but a slanted fabrication that unrealistically anthropomorphizes the fetus. This particular type of argument abortion is particularly repugnant to me because it relies on lies and misrepresentation to prey on people who are at a vulnerable time in their lives and turn them away from a solution they may otherwise have considered.",1
"This debate's URL is ""abortion_30"" which, I believe, indicates that it is the  30th  debate to bear the title ""Abortion"". Next time, run a search and see how many like debates have already been made.  Abortion violates the NAP in that it causes harm to another human, and so I cannot support it. As well, I cannot comprehend how anybody can think that their own choice trumps the right to the life of another; I am alive, if another life is alive because of me, but can be terminated by me at a moment's notice, in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life? It is a different story if you choose to kill yourself, but to choose to kill somebody else... That's simply ludicrous to me.",0

"""it is the same as killing an adult or a child""... No, it is not. It is only a POTENTIAL life and not ACTUAL life. Before week 20, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's womb. It must be attached to her and be supplied with her blood. If society can't keep it alive, then society should not make laws forcing mothers to keep their unwanted pregnancies. It is physically attached to her and is a part of her and must be her choice.",1
Are you arguing against abortion or against your intelligence?,1
"Murder is a legal definition. It is the unlawful killing of another human being. Thus Abortion is not Murder. Shooting a burglar is ""taking someone's life without permission"" however that is not murder either.   The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute. What right is more basic that control over our own body. You have the right not have an operation, or medical care or drugs. You also have the right not to forcible donate blood, or organs, or risk your life to save another.   All pregnancy carries risks to life and health, the fetus uses the mother's blood and organs. She has a right to stop their use. Can she abort in the 9th month? No, but she should have the right to evict. She has control of HER body, not the fetuses.",1
"It is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -""if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents."" - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.",0
"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?    Yes.   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.",1
"Is the termination of a pregnancy the termination of a biological process?   Yes. But you must also be aware that ""termination of a biological process"" applies to just about everything. Taking an aspirin terminates a biological process.",1

"Ok firstly, I can find about 50 things wrong with your essay. You have spurious reasoning, invalid statistics, and a clearly bias and ethno-centric view. However I have arthritis and the clock is ticking for me to tell you as much as I can as to why this essay, is poorly executed, and appallingly deceptive.   ""When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked.""""   This statement is full of a personal opinion and doesn’t contain one bit of evidence that proves your point. When she says “baby” she uses it as a euphemism. However it doesn’t matter how she uses, this statement is completely irrelevant to the argument of an un-born child’s self-awareness. Self awareness is what defines a human spirit (or soul if it helps). Hence this is a totally stupefied argument that does not prove your thesis. If you don’t know how or what self-awareness has to do with the topic of abortion, you shouldn’t even be allowed to make a post at all.    ”Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”   You again back up your statements, not with relevant statistics and data, but with personalized opinion. The question of the debate was Abortion; for or against. With this, you should build an argument based on valid points, not perspective.    ” have a real human being waiting to enter the world”    It weird how you make use of the word “real” as a twig is “real”; a rock is “real”; even dirt. Everything in the physical universe is “real”. So of course an unborn baby is “real”, what does that prove?    ” Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”    Again, your purely prejudice statement is not backed up by any kind of fact. This is what debating is, you give fact in exchange for credibility. Also when you use a statement that implies taking life is wrong, you lay completely oblivious to the fact that as an omnivore you are involved in the deaths of hundreds of animals, hundreds of plant material and every time you wash your hands you are killing germs! You have to be clear how you direct these statements because they are meaningless in this kind of topic.    ” Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds.”   They use arguments to justify there opinion, which is exactly what you are doing now. They never bluntly say an unborn child is not a sapient being without having reason to believe so. If they do say so, then ask them why and they will give you an erudite answer.   Again you use the phrase, “wrong acts in their own minds”, partly reflecting an un-backed opinion and a naïve statement reflecting your mis-interpretation the pro-choice cause.   “Women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.”   This quote only proves you have little and a very subtracted view of why a woman would have abortion. “Inconvenient”, in the way you are implying suggests that all woman, despite rape, teen pregnancy, financial instability and risk of life to mother are inadequate reasons to have an abortion. In fact you put them in a light that makes them look greedy and unwilling. When you use the word “callous”, you unreasonably sensationalize your argument implying you have reason to change people’s opinion for personal gain rather than stating relevant statistics and articulately explaining as to why your view is more feasible.    ” abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.”   This statement implies that you have no understanding of what birth control is as the word explains it itself. It is to regulate the chance of contraception. Abortion is used after contraception and isn’t used to prevent it.   ” 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.”   Abstinence being taught in schools is the reason why children are deprived of sexual education. Sex-ed, was implemented to combat the failure of abstinence teachings as unplanned pregnancy skyrocketed from the 1950 to this day and is still going up.    “If abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place”   I have a suggestion, why don’t you conduct a study proving your thesis? You’re saying that abortion availability determines the amount of unplanned pregnancies? Firstly, ruling out abortion all together won’t stop abortion it will just be conducted in an illegal fashion and will be incredibly unsafe.  “Every year, about 19-20 million are done by individuals without the requisite skills… 68,000 woman die as a result…Many woman travel to third world countries where abortions are legal”  - World Health Organization.    ” What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? ... Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion?  ”  This is the kind of backwards-thinking you’re suggesting we make. We cut back on vital scientific research with the intention of leaving us in the dark about our children’s future complications. With no in depth analysis as to why abortion is wrong on a philosophical and scientific scale, you have no structure to base your ‘banning of genetic research’ on.    “Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.”   If your making assonance to anti-stem cell research, you obviously have no clue about prosthetic stem-cells that are not derived from a fetus. If not then I apologize as this sentence was totally random and had a hardly visible connection to your argument. Also who cares if babies, sapient or not become science experiments. Babies are tested all the time. Firstly they are tested for blood levels and all that sought. They are analyzed for the sake of statistics and data. They won’t be dissected if that’s what you’re suggesting. An unborn baby, assumedly an aborted fetus, is ripe for scientific discovery on the other hand. Again with no analysis as to why abortion is wrong, you have no right to say why experimenting on an aborted fetus is wrong.    “Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child.”   If an unborn being never comes into existence in the first place, it cant make a choices nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and imamate being as rights are exclusively to the human beings, not the fetus’.    ” The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”   What makes you think that when he said “we”, he was referring to humans and fetuses? A fetus is a tangible object with potential for sapience but with no current consciousness. So how can it be that an object without any mind of its own be able to possess rights that overcome it in depth?    ” By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen.”   By that logic it means if I was choosing to become an American citizen in the near future, I am already entitled to American rights. I live in Australia and I am now able to possess guns, not use the metric system and pay tax to America rather than Australia. How can that possibly make sense to you?   “Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath.”   Just so you know the term Hippocratic Oath wasn’t named that way because it was hypocrisy, it was because it was named after the Greek Philosopher Hippocrates.    ” Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"".”   Almost all schools in America have abandoned that oath since 1970. It’s meaningless.   ” It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed.”    An abortion is a patient’s choice, not a doctor’s choice…   ” Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism.”   Again living organism is a wrong word to use. As I said before, living organism encompasses all life forms including bacteria, animals and plant life. Yes it is harming it but not harming a sapient, free-thinking being.   I hope you have the audacity to read and digest this information. I suggest you should read the rest of my material on this debate as you will soon find out that abortion is not a black and white topic but it truly relative. I hope you will also see that you have to use relevant data to back up your information rather than basing it on solid opinions.",1
Will you just go away and actually really people's arguments for once? I said aborting a baby at 24 weeks is inhumane as it has a chance to survive if the mother were to deliver naturally. I've also previously said the abortion gestation should be lowered from 24 weeks.  The problem you're not getting here is that I don't believe people should just go around aborting the babies all the time. I believe a negative circumstance should give the woman the choice to abort.,1
"""Everything happens for a reason""? So incest, pedophilia, rape, and abuse are results of reason?!? There is nothing reasonable about raising a constant reminder of a cruel crime. Those opposed to any type of induced abortion have no idea what its like for a child to carry the burden of being the offspring of abuse. It is a fact that unplanned/unwanted children are more likely to be subjected to abuse and neglect--continuing the cycle. Stopping that cycle of abuse is easy. It just takes one outpatient appointment.",1
"Also, don't isn't seem a little ironic that pro-lifer women all look like they can't get laid in the first place? Just saying.",1
"You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.  You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.  Curious …..what situations is abortion wrong?  I have explained why abortion is wrong. It is not right for anyone to be able to kill something like abortion does…on a completely separate human being. I give it personhood….it is immoral. Taking a life like this is wrong. In war…two sides are fighting. Our servicemen and women sign up to go…they take risks. What risk does an unborn take? How can you possibly compare the two? You can't. War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL  So if someone killed your little girl or boy….you would not consider their lives sacred, special,….that their lives deserved sanctity?   It would be just Oh well……Ill have another kid.  The mother has rights…she had a right to have sex. She had a right to take the risk. But once a life has started….those rights should be put on the back burner until the child is born…then she also has rights to decide what to do with it. Keep it or adopt it out. Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…THAT YOU HELPED CREATE. AFter conception it is a separate human being…this is a scientific fact. A FACT. You propose to kill human beings…you say this is ok.   How barbaric and cold is that?  It should not matter whether the child will make it or not. If it doesn't and dies…then it was meant to be. Abortion is premeditated killing. Nothing spontaneous about it….you hire someone to kill someone…in this case the unborn child in the womb….who was invited in BY THE MOTHER, BUT HER RISK HER CHOICE.  I gee the Oprah example to show that…the argument by pro-aborts does not hold water. Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….  I GOT NEWS FOR YA……WE ALL FACE TRIALS. Oprah did in her life…and she overcame them. She grew up in a home that was not healthy or functional. To kill because you think someone MIGHT FACE A SIMILAR LIFE…is still wrong. So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You said this….""Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy   and self-consciousness.""   Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.  What does a newborn have that it didn't have five minutes before in the womb before it was born? LOL  Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body…and THEN YOU TELL HER SHE CANT ABORT IN LATER MONTHS? LOL",0
"So a husband and wife that don't want children can never have sex.... Contraceptives fail.   So two people who don't want children can not get married - lack of sex is a slam dunk claim for divorce or annulment. You are required to fulfill your marital duties or your partner can divorce you in almost every state. In addition a healthy sex life is cited by almost all marriage councilors as vital to maintaining a healthy marriage.   So how would a childless (by choice) couple be acting irresponsibly? In addition what is the difference to you?  Either they are going to have sex and and abortion (if they get pregnant), or they are going to abstain so as not to take the risk of getting pregnant if abortion is made illegal.   Guess what - either way, no child is ever born. That couple has decided not to bring a child into this world under any circumstances. Personally I don't think they should have to go their whole lives without having sex.",1
"So are you saying that because someone is not responsible to raise a child, we should kill that child? A human being with life? We keep thinking about the body of the mother but let us also think about the body of the unborn. So for every woman that is not ready, we should kill the child because of the foolishness of their actions? You are a human being and let us put it this way, would you want to pay for the mistake of someone whilst you are innocent?",1
Oh and one more thing. If you say that organism refers to life then a human organism referred to as a fetus by doctors and also in the legal field will mean in other words human life? right?? because human organism (life according to you) can also be referred to as human life?,0
"I don't think we're really getting anywhere with the actual definitions and what we class as human, etc. So instead, let me ask you this: do you value the rights of the unborn equally or higher than the rights of the born?",1
"You kept saying that abortion is right?   Sayyad, stop straw-manning me right now. I never once said anything even close to ""abortion is right"". You keep putting words in my mouth. Do you understand how a debate works?   Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible?   This isn't even something I've said either. I don't care if abortion makes a person more ""responsible"" so I never said anything about it. I, unlike you, do not need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it.      You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care.   Again, nothing you've said thus far has anything to do with anything I've said. When did I say I don't care? I'm here aren't I? I didn't care about you're story, but I do care about the issue and your story is irrelevant to it. When did I say you were ""throwing out stuff just like that""? Wtf does something like that even mean?  Either you have the wrong address, or you're the single worst debater I've spoken to thus far.   How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest?   How abortion started doesn't matter. Why would it? It has nothing to do with the issue now.    If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion?   Does this pass for logic these days???  If I don't know anything about abortion then how come you added the number ""99"" to your user name? =/  (note: I'm saying your question doesn't make sense)   Who looks more silly? Me or you?    You or I&lt;&lt;   You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice   Do you not even see your own conceitedness?  You're saying ""I've decided abortion is immoral and I've also decided that everyone should conform to my morality because my morality cannot be wrong, I came up with it!""  Well, how great full these women must be to have someone like you do decide that abortion is wrong for them. =/  And you say this is  not  silliness?   Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics.   Oh dear god. YOU got into law school? Hopefully not to be a lawyer, you'd end up sending all your own clients to the chair.  You think I care that you're a law student? Do you think that makes you infallible? You sir, are beyond egotistical.   Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence.   Now you're just projecting. ;)   Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.    You're not even trying to make sense now, are you? Are you a troll? You must be, no one else could string together so many irrelevant ""arguments"" and walk away feeling like they've accomplished something.   i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance.   Ah, that explains why you didn't bother proof reading your argument. =/   When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Alright, so a reference is pointless because where life begins is a philosophical question, it isn't proven based on how many more people agree with you.  Life is a continuum. It doesn't ""stop"" or ""start"", it just changes.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   jeez, I don't know what I'm more disappointed in; your poor grammar or the fact that I understood that perfectly =/  A person's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves. Unless she's being raped for money, then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   I don't care. Women could get abortions as a hobby for all I care, I don't need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it, I'm not as egotistical as you.   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   Again, I don't care and it doesn't matter. It's their choice. They're making the risk, not you, not I. It's none of out business.    Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   When did I say this? I didn't, because it's not my position.   Try again.   If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts.   Or it means you're an idiot and you can't tell the difference between relevant facts and appeals to emotion/authority.  Anyone can pull up an infinite amount of facts, it mean nothing if they aren't relevant. Though, it's cute how you thought writing this would somehow convince me to answer all your questions as though they  were  relevant. XD   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified.   You keep saying ""law student"" like being a law student matters. it doesn't. And I don't care if someone would ""disqualify"" you for what I've done because  1. It's irrelevant to this debate   and 2. I happen to know for a fact that calling ""non-sequiter"" on an opponent during a debate is not only allowed, but frequently taken advantage of.  So, either you are a liar or your debating league is full of idiots.  Judging by your argument thus far the former seems much more likely.    Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Why did you write this? It has nothing to do with anything EITHER of us has written.   ""Well, we decided that Hitler was innocent last night, therefore abortion is WRONG!"" &lt;&lt; does this make sense to you??? Or are you purposefully using non-sequiters in an attempt to distract me from your paper-thin argument? =/",1
"A baby can't survival outside of someone's care for long. Generalizing your argument, killing anything and any one isn't murder since in some way they are dependent on others and are nothing but a collection of cells.   Should abortion be limited to only being allowed before the 24th week, if not then what is the relevancy of it to your argument? If so or if not, what is it about being inside of a person's body that makes it so different from being dependent on it?   Why do both sides of the abortion debate have terrible arguments?",0
"The short answer is ""yes"", the long answer is ""no"". You are misconstruing the ideas of being a Homo sapien and being a person. An unborn fetus is not a human. That is like trying to say that an acorn is an oak tree. If one can claim such a thing, that is delusional.  It certainly is worthy of life. But that does not mean that abortion is morally wrong or it should not be legal. All you are doing here is throwing out pointless questions.",1
THERE IS A MIDDLE HERE!!   you can be pro-life but also believe people have the right to choose. For Christians who are all pro-life you need to remember that according to your faith God knew what that girl was going to do when he put that baby in her belly. He put it there anyway. If we take that girls right away to choose for herself girls will be choosing life because they were forced to not because they chose that it was the right thing to do. You are eliminating an opportunity for her to find God by making that decision on her own.,1
In the third trimester it is actually safer to have a c-section than it is to have in an abortion.  At nine weeks a baby has a heartbeat.  At 4.5 months he can feel pain.  There is no good reason to have an abortion!!!,0
It has 46 human chromosomes     So do my toenail clippings. Not relevant to establishment of personhood.     it’s a male or a female     So is my goldfish. Not relevant to establishment of personhood.     and it’s complete    So is this post.,1
"Wellll, it's the believers, the carnivorous conservatives and the right wing guys who accuse those of us on the other side of murder and worse. I'd say that's making a moral issue of it, wouldn't you?",1
"There's one major and blatant flaw/contradiction in your statement:   You clearly believe an abortion is the killing of a baby, so how could you commit murder in one way (allowing abortions when the woman is raped or could die), and be against murder in another (using abortions as birth control).",1
"1.Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life.   2.Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.   3.The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out.   4.Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child.   5.The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults, who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions.   6.Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility.   7.Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath that is historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically.",0
"You chose to act irresponsibly.   I got pregnant whilst using the contraceptive pill, it's not as uncommon as you think. Don't assume every person who is pregnant isn't responsible. Just to clarify I didn't abort her, I have a daughter. However I'm just using this as a point that not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception.  Now, rape and incest aren't the only circumstance that warrant abortion. Have you considered medical problems, deformities and disabilities in an unborn baby? What about a heroin addict, a alcoholic? What about someone with severe mental health problems (bi-polar, schizophrenia, BPD)? How about a homeless person? Do you think it is okay in these cases?  I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy. It's how the mother (or doctor)  perceives  the circumstance of her pregnancy. If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.",1
"Let's start with a crude reality just to set the tone, shall we? We already have enough people, and I could do without some living ones as it is.  -  Now let's go to the more accepted question in this debate, ""when does life begin?"" Well, to me, I cannot claim I was alive before I was consiously able to recognize it. This is not to say I wasn't, but it is to say there is an indeterminate level of ambiguity. To what range varies from person to person. Those that claim to know when life begins are ignorant to this reality. Thereby, we shall not instate laws against an amorphous concept.",1
The life of a fetus should have as much value as any other human life.   it is generally accepted that people can kill in self-defense with varying levels of imminent harm as justification - if you apply that same principle to the mother fetus relationship that would permit abortions with varying degrees of danger to life and health of the mother.,1
No. I'm not that old. I'm 30 years old.... in hex ;)  You'll have to do a little research to convert that number to something that means anything to you.,0
"ok and like i saidd, every mothere should have her own desicon on whether or not they want to go through a pregancy. For instance what if it wasnt a accident to have the child and the mother found out that her soon to be baby was special ed. so she desided to get an abortion. I know she's killin a life and i do think thats wrong, but in the same way she might want to protect that unborn from going through pain and trials in the future... Let me remind you that the title of this argument "" Abortion should be Banned"". Thats a straight forward yes or no question and since there are "" what if's"" (what if it is rape, what if it's an aciddent , ect.) in this situation the conclusion is that Abortions should'nt be banned.",1
I think abortion is wrong but I hate crowds and I don't want to end up in a crowded heaven so I let people make their own minds on the subject ;),0
Why counter a wrong with a equally wrong action?  The evil of abortion is equal to the evil of rape.  Only 1% of all abortions are performed because of rape or incest. (Guttmacher Institute),1
There IS no voice. It's the mother's property until society can actually keep it alive without her. It's the mother's choice.,1
"It is true that women who choose to engage in sex should think about their future before they do it, yet it is their body and freedom do with it as they please, and they have the responsible of making a decision, so if they choose sex, then at least, choose safe sex; otherwise, abortion is the real only option because society then will be paying through welfare. What is cheaper? Welfare or Abortion...?",1
"Lol, it’s not every day you see someone play an ad hominem on  themself.",1
You said 'who many times were raped'  I say ONLY 1% OF ALL ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BECAUSE THE PREGNANCY IS THE RESULT OF RAPE OR INCEST!!!!! I have posted this many times.  What would you say if a court ruling said that a child is not a human being until the age of 15? The murder rate of children would INCREASE. The abortion numbers INCREASED AFTER Roe v. Wade. The numbers would DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY if abortion was illegal.,0
"YES! EXACTLY! THANK YOU!  Victims of sexual crimes which result in unwanted pregnancy should be afforded the option to abort, but only as a FINAL solution.  And the only other exception would be when birth endangers the life of the mother, but of course, THAT decision would be left to the woman whose life is in danger.  Abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.  My thoughts exactly. Thank you!",1
"So a woman should go out of her way to NOT solve a problem just because she got herself into it?   It is not a problem, it is a life.   If you tripped and broke your arm should you NOT get a cast on it just because you were foolish enough to trip?   A broken arm is an injury, easily mended. When a person's life ends, there can be to going back.   Why does that backwards logic only apply to abortion then?   It is in no way backward logic. You are equating a human life to a broken bone. If it weren't for that life there would be no bone to break!",0
Don't be ridiculous.   ....................................... ..................,1
"About Ad hominem, Let's say all the nasty things about me are true and much worse. What does that tell us about my claim? nothing. It only says something about me and is therefore irrelevant to the question at hand. So what if I'm logically unsound and have obvious character weaknesses? does that mean I'm therefore incapable of saying anything truthful? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. So to say because of this therefore that I think is a a non sequitur. And since recycling is a good thing I'll say it again. Insult is not an argument, it's a failure to provide one. Now your free to use them if you like but they don’t carry much weight with me; I really am much worse than you think.   Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species.   If that is true, then you are mistaken when you said  Killing a grown kid is murder  Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society. But who decides what is good for the species, how do you define good, good for who?  But to my question ""can I kill it"" Your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done. You recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong. And that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it. Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good. You know that and so do I. But if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us. It is objectively wrong.   And further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained? Because in your scheme it could have been otherwise. In your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong. Because if your correct, like I’ve said, we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing. But when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong. And we know it’s wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates. And your definition of that good ( survival of the human species) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction. Because If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the... We don't make laws to make things wrong, we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong, they are wrong in and of themselves, like murder, theft and disrespecting people; especially our elders.   But what I think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development. Notice how you use the phrase “grown kid” So I ask you what’s the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park? Level of development. The terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case. So when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception, 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong, that’s called moral clarity. That’s why the question “can I kill it” is so clarifying. It’s the last word, it, that makes all the difference. What is it, is an ontological question. I’m not asking the question, what’s its stage of development. That would be absurd to answer the question that way. You would never answer your kid that way. Hey daddy, can I kill it? Well son, how old is it, you know the younger the better. But that’s how you try and answer the question of abortion. I keep asking, what is it that we are killing? And you keep telling me how old it is, well it’s just at the fetus stage. OK, so what is it? And like I’ve said before; a question not properly answered doesn’t go away, it keeps getting asked. So I will keep asking the question, what is it? Till I get an adequate answer. But honestly you know as well as I do what it is and the only reason you would answer differently is if you were trying to justify something that you instinctively know to be wrong.      Final thought on showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgments. You said;  the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership.   This statement from you destroys your whole argument. If this is true, why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.",0
Isn't animal cruelty a crime? Animals are technically not people. So shouldn't it apply to unborn humans when one ends their life?,0

"exactly why we can't make abortions illegal, if a parent is unwilling to take care of the child they are about to have then they should not have had the child in the first place. since they've already had the child. why should they bring it into the world if it is only going to suffer?",1

"When you say that term neither you are portraying to me that either you are confused or you are not sure which side to take. How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion? If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose? Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose? When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please. You words tells a lot about you and to be very honest with you that is why my response is coming so low graded to you because expect to get what you portray. Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less.

Really? I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent. Let us keep it to a professional level please. By doing this you are making both of us look like two children which we are not. My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts? Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion. And again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges. You can say all you want but it wouldn't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level.",0

"Intelligence and desire to have sex are two entirely different parts of the brain. One can be very stupid and have no sex drive. As can one be very smart, very horny and take all reasonable precautions (pill, condom, etc) and STILL end up pregnant. Sex is more than procreation. Other primates (and many other species) have sex for the pleasure alone. Humans have those same desires--smart or not.",1
"waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification   It is proper justification for me and a lot of other people. Because with a potential life, we're not commiting murder. Like I said, we're stuck on the ""potential"" VS ""definite"" point.  .   If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor   I hope you're a vegan as well. It would make sense, since eating meat would mean that you're ending lives.

"firstly, i believe abortions is almost never the right choice, maybe in 00.01% of cases it can be allowed, but rarely. but i believe people should have the choice to do it or not, i may not agree with it in many cases, but my beliefs and morals shouldn't effect someone else's, as i may not know the full story.",1
"I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   Not even close. The retarded are sentient. Comatose may wake up, senile are sentient. You refuse to accept a fetus is equal to what I've compared it to accurately. Instead making incorrect comparisons to support a misguided view.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   In that sense. And in that sense aborting it is morally equivalent to removing a splinter as well.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   No it isn't, because it is not sentient.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   No, you've given statements from the religious (specifically christian) mis-representations of biology and propaganda campaign. These ideas are only found on religious sites.

"Taking the life of another person   . . . is not what happens in an abortion, because a fetus is not a ""person.""   Roe  didn't strip any class of ""people"" of rights, because a fetus is not a person.  Nothing about the abortion right is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a fetus is not a person.

Why not blame them both equally for engaging in consensual sex?  Or why not blame anybody, because that doesn't help anything? Accidental pregnancies can happen to anybody, no matter how careful they are. To think a woman must carry out a pregnancy just because she dared to have sex is vindictive. Pregnancy should not be used as a form of punishment.",1
"To your first point:  What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life. This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Life_unworthy_of_life    Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.  In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book   From Darwin to Hitler  by Dr. Richard Weikart  Now to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?  At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs.   About a contraception that is 100% effective every time. It's known as abstinence. Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD. Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's.   And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them. It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash. There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it. You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they? There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.  You noted well that I see this issue as black and white. It's called moral clarity. When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil.   Final thought: Were you ever a fetus? Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life. Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.  And if you were born after 1972, I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust. 1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America!    http://www.survivors.la/",0

Well obviously you were happy with having a child weren't you? What about that 14 year old girl that got raped? Picture that your loving boy was the product of hate.,1
"Such a small and lacking response makes me regret complimenting your previous one.   ""So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?""  If it was detected during pregnancy yes I would definitely want an abortion but once it has been born it has entered the realm of society where my line is drawn. You make me out to be some serial killer yet you don't expound on how the reason behind it is flawed, you only call me evil and insult my beliefs and party.   ""You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?""   Yes if a defect is detected during pregnancy. Now I am not saying they have to, I am saying that if it was up to me I would choose an abortion, and if you believe that is wrong due to your close minded perception of morality, then that is of no consequence to me. You are trying to run a perceptive analytical argument and it is frustrating me because my source of these views is based on that of a separate pattern of thinking, I am coming from a place of thought and logic, you are coming form a place born from what you perceive to be ""right"" or ""moral"" when in fact you have little to no understanding of the impacts such thinking has had on society and yet you call me a danger. If you think my views on abortion are somewhat cruel, Im sure my views on religion would surprise you even more.",1
"Firstly, unless I missed it, you  still  have not answered my hypothetical question regarding mandatory organ donation to sick people. Why is this?   One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?   You gave me a page from a pro-life page, basically biased by default because they are trying to convince readers that their agenda is the correct one. I gave you four scientific and unbiased sources that defined a parasite-host relationship between two organisms. Not two species. Two organisms. If you cannot see how the fetus fits that definition, which you clearly cannot, then you are beyond being reached by explanation.   So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well?   Perhaps. But, regardless, their life is not dependent on the body of another, therefor there is no need for their death if someone does not want to be involved with them. I am saying this to cut off another rebuttal about euthanizing comatose patients.    Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.   If it is not a brain or a consciousness that gives us our identity, but rather the simple possession of human DNA and the act of being kept alive by a heart, then again, I contend that a fetus and a human liver are equally alive and deserve comparable rights.    Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus?   This is absolute nonsense. I really have no idea what you are trying to say.    Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?   I think I have said before that nobody kills a fetus  because  it is alive, or  because  it has a heart. Please pay attention to the implications of sentence structure. People might kill a fetus because it is dependent on their body and they do not want it to reside in their body anymore, and there is no way to remove it without causing its death.    Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?    I am not in criminal law so I almost hesitate to say this, but it seems as though you were taught false or, at best, misleading information.   http://www.chronline.org/ Feticide%20versus%20Homicide.pdf     But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with?    It's relevance.    Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Okay. I think I understand your train of thought and why you keep harping on the whole not dead = alive thing. If this is incorrect, point out where I went wrong.  Anything that is distinguishable from the dead = alive  Anything that is alive = a life  The act of ending a life = killing  Killing = murder  Murder = homicide  If this is a correct summary of your line of thinking, then you draw no distinctions between different forms of life, their capabilities, and the rights they are afforded, and additionally, you draw no distinction between murder and any other method of ending any form of life. It would mean that shooting someone in pure self defense = homicide. Accidentally striking a pedestrian who was not in a cross walk = homicide. Slaughtering a chicken for food = homicide. Plucking a flower = homicide. Using antibacterial soap = homicide.   If this is incorrect, then I actually do not have any idea why you keep bringing this point up, because clearly you  are  capable of   a) distinguishing between different forms of life   b) realizing that life with higher functions are granted more rights under the law, and  c) understanding that the law does not protect any form of life from being ended by any means.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.   People estimate that as few as 15% and as high as 78% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, many times before the woman even knew she was pregnant. Even on the low end of the estimate, that is a lot of women to subject to a homicide investigation directly after they experience miscarriage. Then, if it has been convincingly shown the abortion was not 'spontaneous' (how? I have no idea), then comes the problem of deciding how responsible a woman is. What if she smokes or drinks, possibly causing a fatally premature birth? What if she fell down a flight of stairs, how will she prove she didn't do it on purpose? What if she stays in a relationship with an abusive man who eventually beat her so bad she miscarried; is this not causing death through inaction? What if she didn't obey her doctor's order of strict bed rest? What if she went on a roller coaster ride or ate some sushi? What if she just stressed herself out too much? How much jail time do the women in each of these situations deserve?",1
"Why should it matter how many she kills? If abortion isnt anything for you....then why do you care? Should there be a limit on how many she can kill?   And I commend you on using the proper terms for abortion, the terms no pro-abort really will use. At least you put it out there for all to see.   ""Killing their baby""..........",0
"Let's say your kid comes to you and says ""Daddy, can I kill it"" I would bet money that how you answer that question depends entirely on what ""it"" is. If it is a fly on your shoulder that's been bugging you, then by all means kill it. If it's the kid down the street, then whoa, we need to talk.   The point is this; this is not some esoteric philosophical question. This is common stuff we do all the time without thinking, it's instinctive. We know how to answer this question and we do it all the time.",0

Abortion is murder. Everyone has the right to live .,1

"But to declare them to be irresponsible, by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like, would be presumptuous.   How so?   ""Technically"" does not necessarily imply hesitance and doubt. I used it in the sense of ""by definition"".   semantics...   No, we aren't. A zygote may be alive, but it is not a homo sapien.   How does human not equal homo sapien scientifically?   I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's.   And I can give many that are not.   Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive   I thought you would have thought this out more. If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.",0
"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.   Had the fetus not been terminated, it could've had so much potential. It would grow up to be a child. It would get to listen to music, smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow. Everything we take for granted in life and life itself, is taken from the fetus.   Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore, it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion. In the same sense, is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life? Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness. This argument is irrational and morally incorrect.  What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision. The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live. It is not her choice to make. It is no one's choice to make. No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life. Imagine the world without you, because your mother had an abortion. You would never live all of your experiences. You would never have emotions. You would've never existed. Such is the travesty of abortion. Over a million lives, of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years, would never be lived.  Rape, sadly does happen. But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem. If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself. Harsher penalities, stricter monitoring policies, promoting rape whistles, reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this. Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible, but we can get this number a lot lower.   Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives. Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences.  Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone. We cannot continue with this madness.",0
"""I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion.""   Oh, come on. How could you possibly say that without bringing religion into the debate?   ""I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting.""   We've been over this. The regret could come from not having a kid when she had the chance. But that's no reason to ban abortion. The regret could come from going against the Christian values she was raised with. But again, that's no reason to ban abortion. There are many women who get abortions and feel no regret whatsoever.   ""With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual.""   Heh. By that logic, women should be required to pump out as many kids as possible.",1
"Oh please....quit making excuses. People dont talk about it because its an act that kills a living human being. And it does not matter where abortion happens its the same thing. Most women do not come forth with this information because of the nature of abortion. IT KILLS. Women know what it does and they don't want to be judged. That is why so many women suffer in silence over past abortions.   I am not a hypocrite...you just don't get this issue. First of all your a man...and men are really not important in this issue...unfortunately. Most laws say after you ejaculate and implant the sperm your nothing....well unless she desides to have the baby and sues wrongfully for child support. Only then are you an issue. If your wife or girfriend get pregnant by you..........you have no say even if you want your child. And you have no idea what having an abortion is like.....or what a woman might just go through, physically or emotionally.   Your opinion would be like mine if I told a NFL player how it felt to be tackled on the field.   You losing it by calling names? Is that how you interact with people.....calling them names and using profanity. Your entire worldview is pathetic...and shows humanism for what it is....and empty worldview devoid of real happiness.   And I do not believe in human euthanazia or the death penalty.   As I said what you describe does not happen that often in the case of mothers immediately in danger of dying...except a tubal pregnancy. As I said...the life of the mother would come first. The doctor would treat the woman....and still would not have to cut the unborn apart.   If I really care about people, you mean the way you dont? I love people and I help and care for people especially people who are less fortunate than I am. It is sad that all you care about is yourself...that much is obvious. What a sad way to live.",0
"So what then, is the ""the purpose for which it was designed"" if not procreation? Pleasure?! Say it's not so!   I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed. And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education. Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature. (And those impulses and desires are not wrong.) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality. I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with. So long as it is consensual, there's no justification. We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber. Do we talk about the morality of football? The morality of swimming? The morality of sleeping?   Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others. Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards. How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal?   LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage. How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though? If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of? As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals. Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle. Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual. That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong.   Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you? It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made. It's an effect. Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex. Not a choice in and of itself. The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception. But sometimes it comes after. Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice.   The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible. I agree that it should not be used as birth control. I agree that we ought to reduce the number. I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that. You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best. It's just...jaded. There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year. I'm not sure how many adoptive couples. My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today?   Again, let me specify. When I say ""prohibition doesn't work"" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws. These would be laws regarding our bodies. Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work. People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please.    Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.   Holy cow you've got to be joking! Victimizes women?! Let me start a new debate for this alone. Please visit it at  http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Do_magazines_victimize_women    I'm all for teaching kids what's best for them. And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves. And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make. It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex.    Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  And this is a fine way to teach sexual education. I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous. We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain. Not doing so is heartless.   As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here. That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate.   Final thought:  Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you. My only ""push"" is that you  not  push legislation on others based solely on  your  moral beliefs.",1
"Okay my personal opinion i would never murder an innocent child, but i belive that we have no right to judge anyone for the choices they make on what they believe is better for their life.",1
"Ok, here's a very real issue of making adoption compulsory: You must make the woman carry the child to full term for somebody else to have the baby. This is while the woman may feel deeply offended/embarrassed/disadvantaged by the pregnancy, and her body is on the line!!!!",1
"For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?   I'm more interested in science, I.E. knowledge of nature, than legal rulings which are a matter of politics.  If you don't have a functioning body that can exist on its own, it follows that you lack developed organs, and even more importantly a developed brain. This means you lack awareness of your own life.  It would be nice if you researched the developmental stages of fertilisation through foetal development, and birth. Then you might appreciate the fact that while a fertilised egg is alive, it isn't a life, or at least not worthy of being granted the rights of a born human life.  The whole issue that you are so passionate about is actually over the killing of fertilised eggs and tiny, unaware foetuses.   The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?   If you're going to grant something the rights of a human simply because it is Homo sapiens sapiens, then this would extend to tissue cultures and blood as well.",1
"I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights. Also I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.Or enother example, permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient. So, because of these reasons I believe that abortion should be legal.",1
"I am totally against abortion because it is similar to killing. You'd better not have sex or at least used contraceptives ,if you are not planning to have a child at all. It doesn't matter in which period of time it's better to do abortion -3rd or 5th month ,anyways you are killing your own flesh and blood. Moreover,who says the child doesn't feel the pain? In fact,he feels really strong agony. Consequently,getting rid of the unborn child doesn't release you from huge moral standard's responsibility. Girls,please,be smarter,you don't want to have serious health problems in the future as well.    http://www.humanevents.com/2006/01/30/ abortion-causes-massive-mental-health- problems-for-women/",0

I beleive abortion should be illegal...so your question is not relavent.   I stated that the father does not get the choice to decide...not that I support his right to want an abortion.   I AM AGAINST ABORTION...NO MATTER WHO WANTS IT.  Men dont have a say because of Roe.......this has to do with privacy and the woman owning the right to her body. The make is a non issue.,0
"First off, I would like to remind everyone that this debate involves the morality of abortion, not the legality of abortion. Those two topics are completely different, especially since the legal system is not set up to be a perfect morality emulator.   A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.",1
"It's not so much killing as denying a chance at life. The argument isn't ""is it ok to kill a newborn"". Abortion involves fetuses and all the ""if it has nails it can feel pain"" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument ""we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance"" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than ""a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain"".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child. But they never say that, why?, because they would die alone. The way I see this debate, one side is blinly screaming ""somebody please think of the children"" and the other side is blindly screaming ""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to"".   Before you devote your lives to ridding the world of fetal pain, deal with the torture that is being carried out uncontested (even though it's often pulbicized=general knowledge), deal with the female genital mutilation, deal with the starving children, deal with the raped children, deal with the unwanted, beaten, emotionally damaged, forgotten, slave children that are a result of poor parental planning you backwards thinking, self-proclaimed advanced specie intellectuals who have nothing better to do than trivialize the pain that exists in this world.",1
"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  ""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.",1
"Hitler was a murderer for having abortions? Like I said, keep it to the topic.   Hmm, lets see...You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with ""go check the Bible."" I'm still waiting for the evidence. I ask two simple questions. What did Jesus say about abortions? What is right and wrong according to Jesus? I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me.  We are all lawbreakers. So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other? God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS. A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies. Why are you trying to deny it? You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS. ""Go get your Bible"" if you think I am wrong.   I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic. We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion. I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with. I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason. The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion. Obviously it is a human being imo. Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic. Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?",0
"I am for abortion but not if it is late-term, the things I feel that must be allowed is abortion after rape, abortion if the woman is not going to take care of her child, abortion if the woman's life is in danger, abortion if the baby is going to be disabled(if they wish) .",1
"I've agreed with a lot of your argument, but I'm particularly disturbed at the part where you say, ""One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.""  This line of thinking is  rational , but some women would use it to justify promiscuity. I believe in abortion in cases where:  - the mother and/or father are too young to support a child, or the mother and/or father are in a situation that would not be a positive environment for a child (ie, abusive relationship(s), poverty/homelessness, etc.);  - the mother's/fetus's life is at risk,  - the fetus is the result of a rape or incestuous encounter;  - the fetus has a  very  high chance of developing some debilitating disease/malformation that will make its developing life difficult.  In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives, they should not use abortion as a Plan B. If they are not ready for a child, and plan to have sex, then they should learn more responsibility and practice safe sex, not just  assume  they won't get pregnant.",0
