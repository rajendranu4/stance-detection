Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st.

Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely.

The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive.

Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons.

Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and 'college' need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more 'remedial cases' is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just 'we want workers ready to start tomorrow' - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces.",0

The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression.

As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups. As access to steadily growing amounts of information becomes more important for all members of society perhaps the role and services of libraries might actually increase rather than decline.",0

The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors.

The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty.

Note I said non kill shelters, in kill shelters declawed cats are routinely put to death immediately as unrehomeable because they no longer trust human beings and who can blame them? Declawing is despicable and it's people like you who are responsible for the millions of cats living in misery with sore stumps and claw regrowth.

If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense. I'd like to recommend everyone who wants to understand the issue better to watch the documentary The Paw Project, which shows just how much this kind of amputation hurts cats, the consequences, and how many of them need another surgery to somewhat repair their paws after the declawings.",1

The needs of the enrollees are that they get the medical attention they need, when they need it, for as long as they need it. Don't try to 'divide and conquer,' to separate the might-be diabetics from the active outdoorspeople from the folks who cross the streets used by cars. In short, you have no idea which camp you fall into until your appendix bursts or you have a stroke from a congenital aneurism no one could tell you had or you get mugged and knifed on vacation in a strange city. 'They could choose innovative plans that provide the coordinated care, information technologies, effectiveness research and safer medicine Medicare has promised but failed to deliver.' Who DOESN'T deserve to get these plans? Why can't this be the baseline of our national healthcare system? What alternative would YOU choose that didn't meet these guidelines? C'mon, get real.

People who are extremely intelligent, very hard working, who understand mesh networks, cellular and microbiology, organic chemistry, geology, hydrology, pest control, and synergistic relationships.

114,362,"The unacknoeledged advatnage of privileging 'starchitects'' over the local talents is that the first come with a set of standards, a rigorous vocabulary and a name that prevail over the compromises usually inherent in a developer-driven culture (cost cuts, value-engineering, the client's 'taste', etc. - whatever could damage a project from the design phase to the actual built outcome). If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...",1
262,522,"Vegans are disproportionayely female, wihte, liberal, highly educated, active, and wealthy. All six of these factors dramatically increase life expectancy. Moreover, vegans are especially careful about what they eat and pay much more attention to nutrition than ordinary Americans. They are far more likely to eat organic vegetables and far less likely to eat fries and hostess cupcakes. And then there's the fact that unhealthy lifestyles like smoking or veganism tend to lead to weight loss, which masks many of the health effects. If veganism had no health effects whatsoever, we would expect vegans to live much longer and be much, much healthier. The fact that vegans aren't healthier--and may even be significantly less healthy--means that veganism is probably a pretty unhealthy lifestyle.",0

Absolutely ridiculous. Referring to their editors as Chimpanzees is beyond low and trying to say that you're not is more than back-handed. And why must one automatically assume that they'll dominate the publishing industry -- especially if all they are interested in is widgets and algorithms? Inconsistent to say the least, especially if everyone else is so damn good. Seriously biased article and extremely flawed logic. If taking these kind of subtle but bratty gibes at Amazon makes someone feel better and gets them a few handshakes over their afternoon lunch in mid-town Manhattan, then I guess that's likely the real end result.

I believe we should also make these private owners of beach adjacent property responsible for rebuilding their own homes when the next storm or tsunami comes their way. Beach cottages used to be ramshackle affairs, built on sticks, with second hand wicker furniture.
