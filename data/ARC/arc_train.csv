But, more important, we desperately need to abolish the use of the term *First Lady*. We are not an aristocracy. The wife of the President has no official role and not a penny should be spent on an office, staff, her clothes, her trips, her hobbies or her press. When we have a woman as President (Clinton's speech last night was the kick-off the 2016 Hillary campaign) the absurdity of giving titles to spouses will be obvious. Enough of the *royal* Presidency. Michelle Obama is a terrific speaker and she should run for office. But until she does, she should keep quiet. ( Ann Romney as well) Let their husbands stand or fall on their own accomplishments.",1
1,"The police notoriously want a monopoly of firepower, if for nothing more to avoid career ruining mistakes such as shooting the good guy - we all know that some police are not that choosy about who they shoot. For me the thought of students helplessly slaughtered at Columbine and Virginia Tech while the police waited outside for the gunfire to stop is enough to prefer the possibility that an armed student or teacher could stop such a massacre. We are again carrying culture so he same people we carry firearms on campus presumably carry outside school and the students and teachers encounter these same people off campus. Not much increased risk, but with the possibility of avoiding a slaughter while the police sit on their hands. Never forget that legally the police have no duty to protect you, you have the duty to protect yourself - the nlaw says the police are only there to assist you.",1
2,"What is the motivation of people who lobby Congress to strengthen the patent monopoly? Is it the public good? Not likely. Like extending the copyright term to life of the author plus 80 years, does that fulfill the constitutional rationale to 'promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts?' It's ironic that since individual inventors are now asserting patents more against corporations, Congress and the President are up in arms about patent 'trolls.' Myriad seems the biggest 'troll' of all, blocking research and testing. Patent were fine when they lead to high pharmaceutical company profits and kept small players without patent portfolios to cross license out of markets, but patents become a problem when inventors sue companies?",1

A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already.",0

19,"I have never understood the concept of the tax advantaged capital gain. Some say the gain has already been taxed when the income ws earned to make the investment. By that standard, only ordinary w-2 income should be taxed at standard marginal rates. A person who purchases 100 shares of XYZ for $50.00 a share and sells it to another investor for $100.00 a share makes $50.00 a share. Not one penny goes to XYZ company to, say, purchase equipment or even better, hire another employee (unless of course it's an IPO). It seems to be just another tax advantage written into law by millionaires for the benefit of the wealthy investment class. Tell me that people would not invest in capital markets if there was no tax advantage and I would laugh. It would be like suggesting that people would not work as plumbers or accountants if they did not get a tax break of 50%",1

23,"The world is a mean, cold, hard, ugly place. A soveriegn nation's highest call is to protect its citizens. Allowing tens of thousands of random refugees asylum makes a nation less secure. A nation must take care of its own first. Only then can it help outsiders. Ideally, those two objectives will not clash. In a time of war, however, they are in direct conflict. Europe needs to not only allow zero new refugees in, but it needs to cancel all current visas and issue no new visas to citizens from the Middle East. When this war is over, when Islam in the Middle East finally undoes its extremist rigging, then immigration and visas may begin again. After all, in 1943, we weren't taking in any German or Japanese refugees, or allowing them to come in on student or work visas. Every nation in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Jordan, is a a grave enemy to values and security of the West. This is a war now. We must act on a war footing.",0

25,"Most restaurant food is already too salty. I'd rather they salted their food LESS and let us control our salt at the table. I don't use table salt, myself. I lightly season my food and then if others want more salt they can have it. Salt should be treated as an adjunct. Food should be seasoned with spices.

26,"I hate bike lanes because they slow me down and inhibit my flow with the traffic. And pedestrians wander into bikes lanes because they think they are not part of the road.

Also when traffic turns through a bike lane this involves extra lights and a real cluster mix situation for everyone. And don't get me started about trucks parking in cycle lanes to unload - all the time. And lastly, the worst is car drivers get to shout 'get in the bike lane' now when I'm going around a truck or something. Bloomberg's ideas have little to do with reality, he's green the way most billionaires are green. One other thing, those electric bikes, they are a true menace.

I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese 'he could not earn a living (sic!)'. I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic.

An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns.

The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is NOT primarily the fault of the U.S., Wall Street and the 2007/08 financial meltdown. The meltdown simply exposed the euro for what it has been since 1999: a fake currency built upon smoke and mirrors.

As a result, in the competitive environment that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s (and, I suspect, continues to the present), I was not just sidelined but humiliated, and not just by my fellow students, but by adult coaches, too. To this day, I hate sports. Now, in my 60s, I wish there had been programs for kids like me, that might have introduced me to physical exercise in a non-competitive setting. Maybe I could have become more physically active and found some healthy physical activities that I could enjoy.",1
65,"Should Europe shun Muslim refugees? Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe. It is fine to want to help the refugees - how about the Arab countries in the region? I haven't actually seen any Arab countries offering help - or is that heresy?",0

When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel.

If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding.

With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful.",1

They learn how to think, how to interact with peers and teachers, and to have some sense of the larger world.

It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is.

Involving family and others in the patients supportive social environment usually is far more effective and, even when done dispite objection by the patient, may preserve the therapeutic relationship. This risk is usually not confined to the moment but is at least in part characteriological and sustained.

Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.' With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that 'stack' crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more 'efficient' than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce. Produce grown in biologically active soil, which is achieved using organic soil building methods, does have more testable ultra-trace minerals. Scientists are only now understanding how important these minerals are to human health. The holes in Christie Wilcox's argument are far and wide.",0

You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense.

Unfortunately, it also leads to people attending, who might not be ready and are doing it because it is free. And ties a schools hands if costs escalate more than government funding. A better way may be to reduce, but not eliminate tuition with have students loans that are partially forgiven upon successful completion of the program, and the remainder of the student loans be set at a manageable interest rate.",0

Homogeneous communities and local officials are better at self-help than multi-cultural ones where you may not even speka the language of your neighbor or even know who they are.

Does there need to be a warning on every bottle of Bourbon telling me what the proper dose is, and not to drink too much or risk a hangover?

127,"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?",0

A foolish assumption ignoring decades of reality. Turning Medicare into a voucher program and letting people 'shop' puts all the financial burden onto the backs of people who can least afford it. Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a 'pay for quality and results' model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid 'pay for performance' component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this.",0

Before denying a convicted felon of any and all of his/her privileges (e.g. voting rights), why not consider the fact that he/she did serve time of which, was deemed sufficient for his/her crime before coming to a firm decision that convicted felons should not have the right to vote?",1
186,Wow! Three of the four debaters don't strike me as being anywhere near diverse in their perspectives on guns. Not one of the gun-gang cited any example of where a student with a gun saved someone from something terrible on their campuses. At least the professor speaks up for rationality.,0

Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable.,0

If we can find a way to express our frustrations, we can work things out.

196,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas.

Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications.

208,"Thank you, Mr Johnson. I would remind people that 'New Does Not Equal Better.' People often make the mistake of assuming everything that is new is better. In fact, we can think of many new things that are worse at the deepest levels on out souls: chain stores, etc. And late 19th Century architecture, for example of the Belle Epoque, is unspeakably superior to architecture put out by the reprehensible 'starchitects' of today. And one need only look to the universally hopeless and laughable car designs of the 21st Century to realize that cars of the 1960s and 1950s, designed by our 'uncool' fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers, were far superior and 'cooler' than those designed by people today who think they are so cool. There is a movement in this civilization towards degradation of the soul, propagated by the 21st Century American corporation, which has been described as having emptiness and degradation at its heart. If publishing loses to Amazon, this will be another manifestation of the reality of the current march towards a world of aesthetic, and therefore spiritual, degradation. That is a future we have to look forward to.",1

They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership.

He always adds salt to my dishes, but no one else does. I think we all have different tolerances for salt and different palates. Everyone needs to be able to make their own decisions. I'm also with you on sugar. Even before I got early type 2 diabetes, I was reducing the sugar in recipes because they tasted too sweet to me. The amount of sugar overwhelmed the other flavors.

This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool. Sadly, what is known today is far different from the older diet and exercise advice that many still follow.",1
214,"I was a straight A student. I was graduated with honors when I received my Master of Arts degree. I learned more outside of school than I ever learned inside, at least once I learned to read. School tends to be boring for both very intelligent students and not very smart kids. Textbooks are dull. The books in the library and the stores are interesting.

My university did not have these in their library because they were so old.

217,Surely people need to see the cycle of events here. People need jobs to pay the taxes to cover the cost of education to get the jobs......round and round we go. There still should be a level of responsibility by the student. I personally know a museum curator/archaeologist that works as a bank teller. This person will never be able to pay the college loan at the current level of employment and the chosen field of this person is quite dismal. Who is responsible for this person's choice? Me? Tax payers? I personally don't think it should be my responsibility as a tax payer to cover the cost of this education choice. Making a blanket statement that education should be free is irresponsible. Free is not free. Someone always pays.,0

219,Patients should also have to undergo mandatory training. I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time because I studied up on pain medication and addiction. Not one doctor over that time told me one thing that I learned in my own. I know more than most doctors. Doctors are passing out pills they don't understand and their patients have even a less understanding how to use them. No wonder why there is a big problem.,1
220,"I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.",0

Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks.

In fact, without the benefit of negotiated job protections or statutory dismissal procedures, like those overturned in Vergara, teachers may be fired for any number of reasons that are discriminatory or capricious, and completely unrelated to job performance. Is a 39 year old, 15-year teacher costing too much on the salary schedule? Then give them the ax. The ADEA does not apply to employees under the age of 40, even if they are expressly terminated because of age. Did a teacher blow the whistle on an unsavory practice at school, related to their job? Well, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that teacher may not have any First Amendment protection for that speech. And gay, lesbian and transgender teachers have no federal protection from discrimination unless and until our Congress passes ENDA. Until then, such discrimination is perfectly legal in many states. Oh, and most obviously, no federal job protections exist for non-discriminatory yet 'capricious' firings -- that is at-will employment, the exact end goal for this dishonest author.",0

228,The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own.

It just happens that after living in several other countries, many of us realize that the USA is not a club we want to be part of. So yes, we give up our citizenship. Good riddance you might say? Fine, but who do you think is loosing the most, the skilled expat workers and professionals who make a conscious decision to abandon their citizenship and are in demand around the word or the US?

I've never forgotten that lesson. One can quickly gather a lot of information on the internet, and I consider that to be a tremendous advance. But it takes critical thinking skills to turn that information into knowledge, to assess and weigh evidence, to draw well-reasoned conclusions and to present them persuasively. A well constructed research paper assignment can help hone those skills.",1

But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student.' Yes it does... you can't spend more than you have, just a simple fact. Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I think the current system is actually the worst of all worlds - a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student the absolute maximum of what they're able to pay, with public subsidies helping increase the price further.",1

On Resy, it is the customers, not him, who pays for the advertising. He seems to be heading toward the idea of making his restaurants more like dinner clubs for regular diners, and also VIPs, whoever they are. (Maybe he means the VIPs are the people who pay for a reservation.) Well, good luck with that.

Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition.

This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law.

The workers on visa are required to have a salary at least as high as the American ones, and they also get pension and stock options. Moreover, they can only be hired if no American worker is willing to take that particular job that should be advertised in mass-media of large circulation. The process itself is expensive because if requires the services of a law firm. Additionally, if fired, the company should pay the plane ticket back home. During recession years, no foreign worker can be hired as long the company fires Americans. If caught hiring illegals, a company may get into big trouble.

Mental health agencies could launch public awareness campaigns to teach communities about warning signs, but that costs money. Add to this the fact that mental illness still carries a huge stigma, making it unlikely that young people will seek the right kind of help. College campuses are also ill-equipped or unwilling to address serious issues on their campuses. It all adds up to a ticking time bomb.

Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good.

These adaptations largely occurred as a result of natural forces such as increasing costs, the search for greater productivity, the search for a higher standard of living, and not as a result of government actions, not because of a lot of 'we have to do this' or 'we have to do that'.

You'd be terrified to let your kid play with neighborhood kids, yet here you think nothing of exposing other people's children to the same. Vaccinations should be mandatory. It's time religion and philosophy (which are one in the same) take a back seat to rationality and public health.",1

Einstein revolutionized physics by imagining a universe very different from what he had been taught. Newton discovered gravity by observing the world around him. History consists not merely of names and dates, but of cause and effect from a great number of disparate forces. George Santayana said it: 'Those who fail to learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.' Embracing 'skills' while ignoring knowledge will not lead us forward -- as a nation, or a world.",0

315,"The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from too many law schools being far too eager to lower their admissions standards in pursuit of higher revenue from student tuition. This is solely a problem created by the law schools. Any potential consumer of legal services should hope that the bar exam standards are not lowered to allow less educated or capable candidates pass. A potential client may never know that their attorney took three or more tries to pass the exam. As a practicing attorney for the last 20 years, I can attest that the quality of new lawyers has been in steady decline for the last 8-10 years. Some that I have to interact with are completely unable to adequately represent their clients. Others seem driven to take any case (if contingent fee based) or drag it out as long as possible (if hourly) by maintaining untenable strategic positions in an attempt to keep up with their billable hours and, thereby, continue servicing their outrageous student loan debts. The degree of professionalism and competency in the legal field has been in free fall and I solely blame the law schools.",0

That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended.",0
317,"It strikes me that the problem is not one of architecture but of the ways in which economics drives and is used to drive development. The only thing any contemporary city knows to do is to give economic incentives to build structures that maximize tax revenues, primarily real estate taxes. Supposedly the increased revenues will be distributed as economic and social benefits. But this model has run its course. New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile. Automobiles are resisted by the wealthy center as ugly noisy dispensers of pollution and pedestrian risk. Even the NY public transit system is quite unable to overcome the need for commuting by personal vehicle. This is clearly pushing to unsustainability. What needs to be worked out is a mode of increasing revenue that does not prejudice development.",0
318,"'You must vote,' I often hear, 'because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!' That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. 'living Constitution', 'originalism', 'texturalism'; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not 'umpires', to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are 'umpires' each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",0

Oh, one detail: the subjects were rats...which correlate to humans 80% of the time in lab study results.

That could never happen in a public square (or Trump rally). So it seems that civic-minded people must not give in to the trolls. Otherwise, we are letting them restrict our freedom to share thoughtful opinion with others. A way must be found to vote out the trolls. For example, comments could be rated by readers as constructive or destructive. The more destructive the rating, the lower that comment falls to the bottom of the heap. Only the thoughtful, constructive posts, as rated by the community of readers, would remain at the top. It could be automated, thus, reducing the cost of hiring moderators.

NATO is showing its true purpose at last: maintain the Western imperial hegemony. Turkey is an important an anti-Russian outpost. Who cares if Turkey does not recognize its own Armenian genocide? Who cares if it stole the country that Kurds were supposed to have and then tried to obliterate the Kurdish identity altogether? Who cares if it nurtured the Syrian civil war? Who cares if it suffocates its own democratic institutions as it transitions into Putin-like authoritarianism? We need Turkey to stick to the Russians.

New Zealand was recently on my mind, and a young woman told me that it was extremely difficult to achieve Citizenship. The other evening, feeling depressed about the course of our Nation, I wondered why Merrick Garland has still not been appointed. Trump, in himself, does not strike me as dangerous, but placing our hope in this once implausible 'phenomenon' makes some of us edgy, uncomfortable and unconsoled.

336,"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

It is selfish for owners to do this. I have two cats who came to me already declawed and I worry that if I did not take them in they would be stray outside cats and probably would not survive. Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince.

I understand it is painful but it is certainly less horrible than abandonment, the stress of being surrendered to a shelter (and really, there is a very low chance in many states for that adult cat to be adopted), and/or euthanasia.",0

372,"Our drug laws would probably have been liberalized far sooner if we had simply allowed all US citizens to vote including former felons and even those incarcerated. Our politicians would probably be paying attention to the issue of recidivism if the people most affected by it were people who could vote. Improving educational and employment prospects for former felons would become a priority if these people were in fact voters. Wrongful convictions, which still happen with far too much frequency in America, would get the extra special attention they deserve if we allowed felons to vote. By disenfranchising this entire group of people, we have created a system that ignores the serious issues related to this population. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world and we disenfranchise millions who are formerly incarcerated because of past mistakes. This process further exacerbates the challenges of ethnic minorities and the working poor. We need to empower all US citizens to be able to participate in our democracy so we can start to create the more equal and fair society we all claim to support.",1

I say that because Nussbaum, and most of the others who have answered after her, are addressing the much bigger question of 'With humanities programs being cut at many universities, what do students stand to lose?' I agree with most of what Nussbaum says, but my take on it is this: money is short, and we need to use it more wisely to ensure that all university students get a good education in humanities, be they future businesspeople, engineers or journalists. The existence of this or that four-year degree, or a given department, doesn't mean this will necessarily happen.",0

Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop. Do we commit obese people who are not compliant with a weight loss program? How do we protect against false committed.

384,"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of 'marriage' has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah 'marry' other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one 'jot or tittle' of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly 'the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order' in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold 'the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order' to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.",1
385,"The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.",1

If MacDonald's can't employ a cashier who's willing to work for less than minimum wage (or for free), why can ABC do it for an intern? The only reason for an exception would be if the intern is there for true training purposes and not for the employer's immediate benefit. Clearly, most interns are there to supply grunt labor, whether or not they actually get a chance to show their stuff. Also, the kind of large corporations who hire rafts of interns can certainly afford to pay them minimum wage to escape all legal scrutiny.

391,"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",0

With high premiums many young people will ignore the law or choose to pay the alternative tax. Insurance companies will not lose money; if enough young people don't sign up premiums will rise or companies will stop participating.",1

I use what I consider to be sites backed by real research findings. I never decide I have some condition based on web research - only if what I am feeling means I need a doctor's advice.

Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service 'doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas.' Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.",0
431,There is no proper way to evaluate colleges and universities. The whole thing is a waste of time and money. A college focused on the bible is very different than one focused on fashion design. What criteria do you use and what can you do to prevent bias by a reviewer? This is really an intrusion by the government into the educational system.,0
432,"As parents we moved to districts that had excellent public schools. Additionally we spent hours teaching our children to broaden their intellect, encourage their curiousity, and ensure their mastery of subjects. Just as our parents had done with us. We don't expect a tax credit for taking responsibility to educate our children. If citizens want to home school their children, then it is their choice. Rewarding this decision with financial incentives is not rational when there is a public option. If parents don't like the public education they have two choices, move to a better district or work hard to improve their local schools.",0
433,"The lede to the story asks, 'Are murder charges against a patrolman an aberration or an example of how police use deadly force too easily?' The premise is wrong, setting up a false dichotomy. It is not a case of either this or that. Rather, it is a case of this and that. The murder charge itself is an aberration. At the same time, the police use deadly force too easily.",0
434,"Police operate under stress. True. However, what is becoming more apparent is that officers for whatever reason are increasingly just too afraid of their job to be trusted with firearms. Rather than engaging a suspect with less than lethal force and running some risk of injury, police officers are becoming ever more reliant on deadly force to eliminate the risk. People are being shot in circumstances in which a cop of a generation ago never would have unholstered his weapon. Police are perpetually saying they feared for their life in circumstances where no such risk was apparent. In effect, they resort to killing people because they are not tough enough to handle the situation with less violence. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen",0
435,"Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place. Professor Chemerinsky, you were so insightful during bar review, and you are right on target here.",0
436,Reasonable public health measures must not be subjected to religious exemption. The measles problem in California is the direct result of permitting parents to opt out of vaccinations for religious reasons or because of reliance on long-disproved flawed medical studies.

Otherwise we get a pendulum swinging from one ethos to another, with the result the intelligence and other agents are given too much freedom and too little real moral support.",0
439,"Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that.",0

We develop a reading list of the books shared each year, and let kids know they have access to them all through our local library. For communities in which books are an unaffordable luxury, libraries level the playing field, giving access to unlimited literary riches to all. In our community, they also provide much needed parenting help through story times and reading activities for caregivers and young children every week. Many families without computers at home get access to the internet at the library for homework help, employment and tax information. While libraries may be redundant for more affluent families, they provide a window into a different present and future for those of lesser means.",0
448,They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules.,1

The rich own businesses and factories, they create jobs, fuel the economy, and if they should run ever run afoul of insignificant things such as environmental law, then let's be honest, it's their water and their air that they so generously share with the rest of us, so why shouldn't they be allowed the occasional beachfront sanctuary to wash away their heavy burdens.",0

458,"Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control.",0

No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.",1

Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?'

The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance.

Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.",1

For example, allowing same-sex marriage by those who want it presents no danger to those who oppose it and in no way infringes on your right not to engage in same-sex marriage, either individually or as a group.

625,"No practical government ratings system could accurately measure learning while controlling for complex multiple aspects of rigor in all fields and for the differing preparation and potential of students at each institution and in each program. Among the many unintended consequences would be an increased need for mid-level administrators, decreased academic rigor, and weakening of policies that lead to some student failures -- rigor and policies (like required attendance, participation, and timely work) on which the value of degrees to employers and graduate institutions is based. My specialized private non-profit college has many non-traditional students who come for artistic and technical training and don't plan to complete a degree (often because they already have one in a different field); they leave when they've learned the rare, highly marketable skills they came for and find work, but they depress the graduation rate despite their satisfaction and success. The value and effectiveness of colleges is not so easy to measure, and the unintended consequences of measuring them crudely could be devastating to many excellent, effective, but atypical institutions, or programs within institutions.",0

The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along.

I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.",1

Back in my military career, it was common for foreign nationals to enlist, but hey did not get a Secret clearance until they became U.S. citizens and renounced their birth citizenship. That clearance was critical to becoming a non-commissioned officer or commissioned officer. Maybe the Congresswoman found out she would also lose her clearance if she kept here non-US citizenship, and that would put her seat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence in question. Just guessing there, but I wouldn't want anyone with dual citizenship - and therefore assumed dual allegiances - on any Congressional oversight committee, especially one with access to U.S. national security intelligence.

There is simply no way that the austerity prescribed for Greece by the Troika can do other than drive the country to economic suicide.

We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague 'not to lose too much weight.' since he liked his women curvy.

I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit?

I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

Allow anyone and everyone who wants to create a school - to teach arithmetic, English, physics, creationism, evolution, global warming, diversity, Ebonics, computer programming, metal shop, cooking, basketball, or basket-weaving - do so, and let them charge what they wish. Let them accept any students they want, and let them hire whoever they want to teach. Let parents have the freedom to choose the school, the teachers, and the lessons they want their children to learn. Lay off the school boards, and the school committees, and board up the entire Department of Education. Let the government bureaucrats run a bake sale to keep up their standard of living.

If I were to place any restrictions on unpaid internships, I would say it's valid to limit the number of hours employers can require a student to work unpaid. If it's the summer and you're only working at your internship part-time, you can get another job to pay your expenses.

China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair.

To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there. They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet. For me the question is, 'How do we help people who are suffering, so they make better choices?' Good faith, means trusting others to behave altruistically; unless they don't.

724,As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

Furthermore, there is actually very little agreement on whether an idea is offensive merely because of the way it is expressed, or whether certain ideas should be considered so offensive that they may never be expressed in even the most cultivated verbiage. The writer's premise that anonymity produces bad ideas and vulgar expression appears highly doubtful. I submit that the quality of the idea being discussed is the only thing that matters, and that there will never be a consensus on that evaluation. If quality is too low (as in the bulk of what appears on Twitter), individuals are free to consider the idea poor or the manner of expression deficient. Openly airing all ideas still appears preferable to me to confining discourse to speakers who only express the right ideas, and who do so with a prescribed minimum of elegance.

Librarians teach among other things, finding and evaluating information. This skill is of tantamount importance. It is needed throughout life.

Classroom teachers have less and less time to teach anything that is not evaluated on a standardized test. This is what No Child Left Behind has wrought. Lawmakers and administrators are very short-sighted if they think that eliminating school librarians will have little impact on their students. As Samuel Johnson stated 'Knowledge is of two kinds.

The same thing thing can apply to a blog like Paul K. and the NYT, who has endorsed HC. Are thumbs up or down being controlled in favored of the person that they have endorsed? Are comments being generated in favor in the person that they have endorsed? I'v been reading PK and the NYT since the start of Berrnie Sanders run for POTUS and most of it posting was for BS with thumbs up ranging from 200 to 500 thumbs up. Then a couple weeks ago a almost complete shift from BS to HC, with HC thumbs up in the hundreds? Maybe it's just me, but it appears the comments are being manufactured lately in HC favor? So, if you control the vote,you control the election, and if you control the blog and the comment section more than likely you control the final thought process .",1

This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less.

The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue.

Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school.

No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete.

I wonder if more courageous columnists might be willing to directly take on points that commenters raise. I feel that there is an awful lot of repetition of memes by columnists that have been discredited, such as Sanders's supposed pro-gun positions, when in fact he has a D minus rating from the NRA. Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them.

Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out). This country's test-prep educational policy weakens our students' ability to struggle with a challenging problem, and denies them the sense of accomplishment when they succeed.

A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers.

This is in total conflict with US values and is akin to apartheid South Africa -as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu. As for Israel first influence, it is not only the impact of the agent of a foreign government (AIPAC) but also wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson who can provide the funds needed to make or break a domestic political campaign. What is worse is that many of these wealthy donors are more politically concerned about Israel than they are about the USA.",0

Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation. Some medical imaging companies probably have relevant technology.",1

It is not as if they didn't know that children cost money to have and raise! Yet because they get a tax break for having them and I don't I am forced to help pay for them!

855,"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.",0

864,Monopolies as monopolies are always dangerous which is why when one is permitted it must be under the tight control of the government and it must be by law committed to the betterment of the customer's interests and those of the public. Once a monopoly is permitted it is no longer a typical corporations competing with others. It is by definition the only place that a consumer can turn for that product or service thus its power to abuse that situation is massive and must be strictly controlled. It's price structure cannot be allowed to be government only by the corporations interests and the way it conducts its business must be a matter of public scrutiny. Google is no different....it has already shown its monopolistic tendencies by freezing out other content and preferring serve results thst are beneficial to it and its partners thus depriving users of intimations that may be beneficial to them. My preference would be not to allow any monopolies and to break up any that occur through mergers or other corproate transactions.,1

A country in the end is just a piece of land between borders. What matters - and what keeps a country viable - are the values a country stands for. No piece of paper is going to change someone's allegiance in times of peace or war. Even Americans, when fighting in wars, always herald higher goals than mere defense of their country.

The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member.

But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet.

873,"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course.

But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing.

That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time.

As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.",0

Over 4% of the voters and a large margin to overcome in any election. And it worth noting that those who will be unable to vote are Democratic voters.

They stagger in and out of our lanes like zombies. I can ride much faster and safer when I ride with the cars in the car lanes. People on cell phones and dogs on long leads are afraid of cars. As a biker, I use that fear to my advantage. The only other way I can imagine getting people to pay attention to where they are, might be to add some heft and/or pointy things to bikes, so that when a pedestrian wanders in front of one they might be impaled or knocked good and hard. That might learn them to look up from their mindless daze.",1

Would he be pressed to abdicate in favor of a daugther? Elizabeth II would be the only British monarch ever to abdicate, except for the ignoble Prince of Wales who abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson and lives in disgrace in the British consciousness as a result. The throne of England is a position for life; it is an investiture. Furthermore, Queen Elizabeth is doing her job quite well; why should she give it up?",1

Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election.

It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test.

That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?",1

McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States?

Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable. Now both of us would have been relegated to working class jobs or accumulated so much debt (as so much pressure) that we could never dig ourselves out of that hole. The rich and powerful have us where they want us, and they've bought the politicians who keep their boots on our necks. Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy.

It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually.

Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs.

966,"I have worked in a variety of office environments since 1978. There is no question that the open office concept interferes with productivity for jobs that require concentration. I found it degrading to be put in a bullpen after having a windowless private office (which was also modular). There is nothing like shutting a door to say to people, don't bother me, I'm working. Movement and ambient noise are highly distracting. If you are visible, anyone can feel free to interrupt you. Over the years, the partitions got lower, more transparent, the spaces got smaller until finally, some employees don't have assigned spaces, they sign up for a space. This on top of stagnant wages for the middle class? It's insane. The real enemy to work productivity, in my view, is social media. Cut off the access to one's social media during the workday and you'd get a lot more accomplished.",0

We live in a time where the individual's rights under the law are ignored with indifference by those who feel empowered by public office or the ability to influence those in public office. There is much corruption in government, these days, because it is so hard for citizens to be fully informed about what their governments are doing and why. Public officials across this country are using their authority and discretion to advance their careers and to serve powerful or very influential entities with indifference for the impacts upon the citizens they represent unless those citizens are equally powerful or very influential and can challenge the public actions which affect them.",0

The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change. How long must the people of the United States be forced to maintain a foolish policy driven by the self interests of a small politically connected community?",1

It's the vehicle through which students are taught to gather and evaluate serious sources and THEN create a convincing argument or thesis to prove/demonstrate. But, teaching the process successfully requires close attention from the teacher. In teaching, I set up the process by requiring interim reports at each stage: bibliography, creation of the thesis; first draft, finished draft. At each stage, I graded and criticized. Obviously, most institutions do not afford the amount of time this takes so the process gets mangled. And most English professors avoid teaching freshman English/comp so the course does not get the senior attention it deserves. A pity, because the research paper is key in teaching the student how to do college work and how to write serious papers.",1
975,"The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality. If you insist on sacrificing yourself on this altar to show ethnic solidarity, don't be surprised when people conclude that Islam is still stuck in the past. As Rhett Butler once famously said to Scarlett in 'Gone with the Wind' when she refused to abandon black mourning clothes for a husband she not only didn't love, but despised, 'How closely women clutch the chains that bind them!'

However there are at least two strong arguments against home-schoolers' inclusion (and against the tax payer argument) that none of the debaters brought up: 1) Private school families also pay taxes and yet may not try out for public school teams 2) Public schools only get funds based upon enrollment. Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken? I suppose the only reason it's even considered is the opportunity for competitive advantage to the school. If they were demanding inclusion in art class, I doubt it would be on the table.",1

980,"A note regarding reparations for slavery: The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare, in the course of which captured soldiers and civilians would often be sold as human chattel. European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.",1
981,"The only thing that makes bikes in the city absolutely maddening is the fact that bike riders do not obey traffic rules. They just plain don't. Every time I hit the streets on foot I have to dodge a cyclist who is ignoring a red light, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, riding on the sidewalk, making a turn on a red light and on and on. No one monitors them or makes them face the consequences of the hazards they pose. The recent proliferation of bike rental businesses is a sign that the mayor wants this in a bad way. The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park. The pedicabs are now just as bad and they're carrying naive tourists in the back seat on a ride to catastrophe.",1

A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which all civilized people aspire. Put them (members of the so-called 'royal' household) out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter.",0

986,"I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns?",0

As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.",0

A droning teacher is telling a large college class, presumably in English or Creative Writing, that they have to create a good, salable product that a publisher would WANT to publish (and edit) for a profit. Then a smarty pants student stands up, tells everyone about the Xerox system (whereby one could theoretically print just a single book) and tells the class 'Now, EVERYONE can be a published author!' The elated class, thrilled to hear they don't have to learn to write well, market themselves, edit anything or make a profit for the publisher...STAND and applaud. That in short sums up everything here. EVERYONE can be now be published, since the costs are virtually zero to Amazon or any publisher. That, of course, means there will be 99% dreck, and to find anything decent to read, you'll have to wade through it on your own. That's what publishers and editors USED TO DO for us!",1

First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word. Secondly, too many authors with great books are out in the cold since they cannot land a big time author. The system does not work very well for the readers. Go into a book store and look at the crap on display. Where do they find these books? With bookstore shelf space at a premium, I welcome anything that allows the little guy a chance. Besides, with e publishing, why do you need book stores? I like the feel of a book in my hands but at 25.00 it is too much. When the published gets 60% or more it makes no sense for anyone.

Also, parents don't always make the best choice for their children. They can be strongly influenced by family and cultural norms, and be in denial of their children's developmental delays. Choice sounds wonderful--who wouldn't want more choice?--but when those choices are based in emotional reasoning and not logic and sound social science, choice can make parents feel good but rob children of what they need. Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model. Teachers and day care providers can be taught the skills for providing parental education and even breaking through denial to some degree.",1

I think that to make myself aware that I was having a nightmare was the first step to put an end to my nightmares, because only then I could then make myself wake up. Today, I can not only wake up when I want, but I can also manipulate my dreams (well, most of them at least) and, if one of my dreams is interrupted, I can sleep and go back to it.

1000,"The only answer to the overweight epidemic is continued efforts at education until people understand why they are obese and take steps to permanently adopt a healthier lifestyle. When I see obese people I want to ask them why they aren't taking responsibility for their own health and tell them how much their irresponsibility is costing all of us. When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, 'Don't you love your kids?' When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country. Talk shows, tabloids, news outlets must keep the message coming. And overweight people have got to start eating their vegetables, cutting out processed food, and exercising.

Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong.

Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with. Third, there have been dramatic boom/bust cycles in crop prices the past few years, but this has been driven by speculators in the commodities markets, and currency manipulation (China). Fourth, farm products such as corn and soybeans are one of the few items that this country still exports in large amounts, so you had better be careful what you do.

Instead, intelligence (in both senses), international police work and special forces when needed would have been more appropriate, more economical in lives and treasure, and more effective.",1
1023,The problem is that the US needs to have a 'strong American president with a smart strategy and buy-in from the Arabs and Israelis' to trump the Lobby. What other country lobbies to the extent that you need exceptional circumstances to overcome them? That's the problem right there. Why don't we write about the Belgian Lobby all the time? We share values with Belgium too. That doesn't mean we worry about them yanking our chains and meddling with our politics.,0

As kids, we took pride in our handwriting...today...I don't think kids know what a pen is. That's sad. I look at some handwriting from pretty high level professionals and it's atrocious. People don't even write whole words anymore. To me, this speaks to standards, which I believe were effectively lowered forever when spellcheck was invented. Soon the question will be asked...do children need to write at all...can't they just text the answers to their teachers? I, for one, look forward to the beautifully handwritten notes I get from friends and remember them much more than emails and text messages. Please, let's not lower the standards on handwriting too.",1

1029,The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd. The free account but profits made through hidden unrelated fees no one expects. It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes. They charge a $10 surcharge on exit for every child that enters the store (with no signs posted about this on entrance). And an assortment of other fees that change as people catch on. And yet people keep coming for the free food. When the store wants to increase profits it comes up with more absurd fees.,0

1032,"Mr. Stager is against 'random' teacher assignments, as well as the artificiality of keeping to schedules. Virtually all activities, and certainly jobs, require working within schedules and learning from those more skilled or knowledgeable. He envisions a utopia where professionalism is unnecessary. 'Everyone is a teacher and learner all of the time.' I suggest the next time Mr. Stager goes to a physician he might accept that 'everyone is a doctor and a patient all of the time.' He can then be treated by a doctor, an office manager or a fellow patient. Mr. Stager may have some good ideas about integrating computer learning and traditional teachers. Few people would object to that. Mainly, he seems to be advocating one more experiment in meeting students at the lowest common denominator of their attention span and undercutting the expertise and authority of the teacher.

However the idea that because one does not use a public service one does not have to pay for it is absurd. If you follow this logic, then every taxpayer can choose how much taxes to pay based on what services he (or she) uses. Personally I don't think all these wars are benefitting me in any way, so I then will deduct the percentage of tax that funds the wars. I use only certain roads so I will deduct my portion that goes to fix the roads I never travel. This is ridiculous!",0

Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable.

In our very polarized world, many people are understandably reluctant to speak out on controversial issues, unless they can do so anonymously. If we want to know what people really think, we need to let them speak anonymously. So long as there has been written communication, people have had that ability, and maybe that right. Before that, people threw rocks under cover of darkness to get their point across.

That the former Rocky Flats is now, after cursory cleanup, rechristened a wildlife refuge, is a bad joke; during the recent Colorado floods, the old settling ponds spilled over, but no press organization has made any more than a terse mention of that. Many of our Superfund sites were nuclear facilities--badly run, often by influence- peddling contractors; careless about safety; top-notch only at classifying and concealing corner-cutting, errors, and injuries. What has changed that anyone thinks we will do better now? Is there anything in the way government works now that would encourage anyone to think that a renewed nuclear building program would fare any better than the long-ago Washington State Public Power Authority, which never opened a single plant?",1

Drugs of abuse and addiction tend to move in fads, fashions, and trends, and it is important for public health that doctors' training adjust to these constant changes. At this moment the trend is opioid addiction particularly prescription drugs. The trend is moving a bit back to heroin (because it's cheaper!) but prescription drug addiction is still a huge public health problem. We (doctors) created the problem (inadvertently) and we should help solve it. A brief web-based training is not too much to ask; for many doctors it will be redundant as is much of the ongoing training we are required to participate in; but it is important to spread the word widely in the medical community.",1
1045,"I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.",0
1046,"As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves.

Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries.

My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..",1

So the Supreme Court had a eureka moment and ruled gay people had the same rights as the rest of the American People. Donald Trump has famously promised, if elected, to use the power of the Oval Office to drag his enemies through the courts. How is that arbitrary application of power to be seen as anything but a descent into corruption and an end to rule of law and the beginning of the rule of tyrants?

Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity.

1115,"Historically, the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in its more potent forms -- as, for example, considering citizenship as intense as marriage, 'till death do us part' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy-making. Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.",1

What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit.

Yet every US child is to get this on day 0? And then 2 more? What on earth for? Bombarding a newborn's immune system with so many assaults so early is ridiculous and imo criminal. Why are more than 80% of the outbreaks occurring in vaccinated children? Is the vaccine even effective then? Aluminum (a neurotoxin) is added to many vaccines to purposefully inflame the immune system to react to the virus (called an adjuvent) and yet aluminum is highly inflammatory and toxic to the brain. This is madness. Why is infant mortality under 5 years the worst in the US, which gives 35 vaccines (!) and best in Iceland and Japan where they give just 11? A study in NZ found that unvaccinated children were far more healthy (far less asthma, excema, ADD) than vaccinated children. Get the facts people.",0

A very smart, organized person that enjoys cooking can design a diet without meat that is so heathy.

It has always intrigued me because the American stereotype is the opposite.,0

For people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a Spanish speaking or Francophone country, spending the time to learn to speak the language is of dubious worth. Learning to read and perhaps write the language is altogether another matter. If you can read Spanish, French, etc, you can read the untranslated material from each country.

It has been for many years. We need to have Taiwan in the UN. And it was in the UN. Except it was booted out because of the bullying of Communist China. The only time this has ever happened was with Taiwan. Taiwan, not Palestine, needs to be recognized for what it is, a true, independent, democratic state. The US and the rest of the democratic world should immediately recognize Taiwan and honor all treaties with it.",1

Thus many of us are trying to live more sustainable lives, which often means turning our backs on suburbia, car culture and over-consumption. Choosing biking, car sharing companies like ZipCar, and living downtown means not only helping the climate and environment but spending less money on a car, which is one of the worst investments a young person can make because of depreciation and expensive car loans. In another part of today's Times, there's an article about predatory lending in the used car loan industry. I think taking part in the sharing economy and other alternative ways of consuming shows a lot of maturity and responsibility that older generations could learn from.",0
1155,The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate.,1

As a low-maintenance type of gal, the sort who can get ready for an evening out in under 20 minutes (and that includes the shower), I would not be able to tolerate a guy who had 'manny-pedis' and facials. The very idea would make me cringe. Many years ago in my 20s I went on a few dates with a guy who had more hair grooming products than I did; it just didn't work out. I've been married 15 years now to a handsome guy who is clean but doesn't primp or spend time worrying about grey hair or wrinkles. The only scent he gives off is from his deodorant and soap, and that's fine by me.",1
1158,"As a former network and radio communications specialist for the U.S. Army and a small network administrator, I believe that I can say with confidence that I agree, eliminating librarians so that they can be replaced by technology is a gross diseconomy. First, the school board must be forgetting about the fixed costs of maintaining a library. Second, there is a complete neglect for the fact checking costs. Third, current technology costs are prohibitive; the school board's enthusiasm about the power of technology, though understandable, is misplaced. Then, there are the children themselves to be considered. What level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material without a person to person interaction that will be able to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's, inquiry. That alone should be reason enough to reconsider.",0
1159,"'I -... - would not support the idea if I doubted our ability to put environmental safeguards in place.' Putting 'environmental safeguards' in place and preventing disasters are not the same thing. Standard, well intentioned engineering practice in oil production, refining, and transport includes safeguards like double and triple redundant fail safe systems. Still, engineered systems fail and all too recently we've had well-head blowouts (Deep Water Horizon), refinery explosions and fires, and oil transport disasters ranging from pipeline ruptures to tank train derailments to the Exxon Valdez. Imagine a perfect storm situation off Virginia Beach where a well head blowout coincided with a Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil from the Chesapeake to Iceland and a potentially mortal blow to already fragile shore communities and fisheries along the way. The only way to be 100% sure that the East Coast won't suffer catastrophic damage from oil production is to outlaw the outlandishly risky exploitation of hydrocarbons in our salty ocean waters.",0

1161,"Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?",0
1162,"I would point out that the ability to 'freely express his or her ideas' was won for the United States by people carrying, guess what, guns. The 'freely expressed ideas' of the same have also been, since the Revolution, protected by people with 'guns'. If one has a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, then, it is assumed, one has passed various 'tests and inspections' to be allowed to do the same. Of course, none of this will stop the 'illegal carrying' of firearms but I do not see an increase of 'gun violence' on campus as being a natural result of allowing law abiding citizens carrying firearms on campus.",1
1163,"Mr. Miron's argument amounts to 'we can find some examples where capital has found tax havens more attractive than the US' so instead of making sure that worldwide income is properly classified and tax properly paid here by all US citizens, he would have us throw up our hands and not tax any of it. This will, as is well known, only encourage further tax avoidance schemes, since the reward is now a complete free ride. Another way to look at his reasoning is to say 'despite giving out speeding tickets people still drive over the limit, so let's get rid of all speed limits.' A few libertarians over at Cato may think this a good idea, but the rest of us not so much.",1

Providing bike-only lanes not only allows for safety of these riders but also prevents the use of sidewalks by some of the law-breaking riders, which is a great hazard to pedestrians. I agree that it will take years for regular commuters to switch their mode of transportation to the bicycle, but allowing for this possibility is a great start. Don't forget that bicycle-friendly cities like Amsterdam have a system of public bicycles as well, which helps promote this eco and health-friendly mode of transportation. Finally, if car congestion and revenue for the city are problematic issues, perhaps we can implement a carpool system that only allows free access into Manhattan to cars with multiple passengers and would charge a toll for single drivers.",0

Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc..

Perhaps a substantial part of the proceeds from liquor licensing should go to the hiring of additional cops to station in neighborhoods where bars are common. One could also require businesses that sell alcohol to have breathalyzers and post a sign saying that by entering a customer agreed to a breathalyzer test upon leaving. In general, however, what is needed is much greater enforcement of our traffic laws and penalties that have a chance to be effective as a deterrent across the board, including mandatory jail time for a D.U.I.",0

He often informed the class that his door was always open and to please stop by for any questions or concerns. He was caring, helpful, and respectful of all students in the class.'

Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else.

I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they 'hate the sin, but love the sinner.' Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry. And then non-Christians might begin to realize that they can't use the Christian faith (or any other faith) to justify intolerance.

So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm.

As it is, many government employees do not have any meaningful assignments and you want the Greek government to hire more people? What you are actually proposing is a massive expansion of welfare payments to the unemployed in Greece except that you claim to have given these people a job and so instead of social welfare you want the world to think of it as job creation.

Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests?

Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school.

But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.",0

And, whether true or not, just the fact that a certain percentage of the world's population believes those 2 are murderers really should take them out of the running for that seat....Since the seat is, after all, now just a public relations job to bring in tourism and maintain a positive image of an out-dated monarchy...

1208,"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!",1

The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams.

Most Americans cannot understand why someone would want to learn a foreign language. Having said that, my 5-6 years of French and limited German never proved of much use in those countries (many Germans speak English, and the French are less than helpful to foreigners trying to speak their language) or elsewhere. Later in life I took up Spanish, and this has proved to be very useful in travel and being able to practice it on a regular basis (Washington, DC area). I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life. BTW I have one niece taking college Arabic and another taking high school Spanish.",0

Simultaneously, and very importantly however, Greece must undergo serious economic reforms. For example the creation of a land registry, a stop to political vote buying by politicians, a stop to corruption, the creation of an apolitical statistical service, a non-pollitcal civil servant based on merit instead of cronyism, etc. Does the new Govt show any signs of this (beyond rheteric)? Absolutely not.

What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession.

The harm can be both financial and physical. The lag time between the misdeed, the discovery, and the correction can be years. Many of the regulations we have in place are reactions to the failure of individuals and companies to behave in ethical and legal ways. Businesses fumbled away their opportunities for self regulation a long time ago. That said, businesses still have a right to participate in the writing of regulations, as do their customers and other stakeholders. Regulations are, by nature, burdensome.

They can't get these jobs because the unions are all about who you know, whether it's teaching in a nice town, or trying to get a job at the docks.

Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

In such a case when I am spending $38 on an entree, would the restaurant prefer I send it back and refuse to pay, or eat it and grumble about it on Yelp, or simply shake a little salt on it and be happy and tip well? It is the restaurant's choice. In addition, salt is not cinnamon. It is an absurd comparison. An under salted dish is unpalatable. A dish with less than optimal cinnamon is still fine.",1

This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.",1

Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality.

It was planned meticulously to meet twenty-first century needs, integrating technology and print. Eight years hence the library remains a campus focal point. Additional space has been provided for student seating as well as for technology-related projects. To my way of thinking, libraries and books remain fundamental to learning.

There were times when I was pretty sure that the judge was relying on the court reporter's good sense of hearing to make a complete transcript and may not herself have heard everything that was said.

1295,I certainly remember when Focus on the Family came to our town en masse from California with local folks picking up the tax tab and then having Mr. Dobson immediately try to change the Colorado constitution to legally discriminate against gay people here. It was savage. And it was not about just having your own beliefs- it was about identifying people on the basis of their biology and denying them housing or being able to fire someone. Dobson was off studying gay pornography in DC to prove what he was saving people from- it was a surreal circus and earned Focus a black eye for a very long time for its divisive and ugly attitude towards total strangers. Believe whatever you like but trying to embed a particular religiously based discrimination in law is not OK.

1296,"When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them. We know intuitively what we as a society are willing to accept and harming children is not among them. What we do to ourselves as adults is one thing. Losing a child unnecessarily harms us all.",0

My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

Furthermore, even if you were to issue the more accurate statement that 'immigrants have seen a net gain in employment compared to 2007, while native-born Americans have seen a net loss,' you would still be intentionally misleading your readers, and here's why: By omission, you are implying that the gains of immigrants and the losses of native-born Americans are directly intertwined. In some ways, perhaps they are. However, you are ignoring the fact that the economy shed 8.7 MILLION jobs in the 'Great Recession,' having to do primarily with the recklessness of our financial services industry and almost nothing to do with immigrants.

Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one.

Also, in common with other people who say the HSR project should simply be scrapped, professor White names zero alternatives. How, I wonder, does he propose to deal with the huge population increases projected to take place in California in the coming decades? How does he plan to move those people between the cities? As another contributor has already shown, simply building more highways or more airports will cost just as much, if not more, than HSR, and they'll soon be congested as well.

But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services.

In other words, the more students dislike a professor, the better those students do in similar classes down the road. Why? Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery.

The biggest fear now is that when Tea Partiers and Republicans finish taking the government apart with the rataionale of getting spending under control, unemployment may be higher. Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost.

Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism.

It is only because the current system within which prostitution operates has so disempowered prostitutes -- leaving them vulnerable to both their clients, their employers, and the law -- that their wishes are so easily disregarded. If the prostitution laws were reversed so that it is the johns and the pimps, not the prostitutes, who commit the crime, then prostitutes would have much greater power to avoid unwanted sexual contact and violence, and perhaps a much better chance of getting out of the business altogether.",1
1443,"A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.",0

I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer!

Since the actuarial value is increasing from 45% today to 80% (% of premiums paid in claims) in the individual market, its going to be a better deal by definition. Mr. Roy forgot to mention that. The young male premiums before subsidy go up so much because they are offsetting higher premiums traditionally paid by women in the 'free market' because they have babies, even though it usually takes two. And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare.

The people who spend this money are overwhelmingly those who can't afford it, so that the 11 million they get back in services is less than what they lost in the first place.

The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.",0

Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country.

I know because though Jewish by birth and sensibility, I see Israeli actions as shameful. We of all people should not demonize another people, one who had little to do with the Shoah. Let's get real. We need a more liberal government to free Palestine with its own power, what exists not at all now. Let the US become an honest broker or all hell will break out. The economy of Israel is thriving; the economy of Palestine is horrible. Do the honorable thing. We Jews know a thing of two about persecution.

1499,"I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.",1

I actually belong to several libraries now as a full time RVer so that I can access books on my Kindle. Yes!

As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all. One of the best compliments I received from a student was in the form of what he or she must have thought to be highly critical, and I quote: 'The worst teacher I have ever had.

It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery.

Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.,1

Don't these fellows have any self-respect? Couldn't they at least hold out for a six figure sum? Yes, corruption in politics is distasteful, and of course, illegal.

1530,"Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them",1

Who is going to handle the extra layer of paperwork? As for the waste, most enrollees have no control over the wasted spending, and they often have no idea that it's wasteful. For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes.

Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to.",0

It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere.

1559,"Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.",1

Those of us who love cats don't want to see well-meaning humans decree that millions of cats suffer to meet the needs of humans.",0
1561,"I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.",1

After all, if you wanna get somewhere, his Highness has provided bicycle lanes! Imagine turning all that space into bus lanes.

Yes, when going to McDonald's and getting 5 things off of the dollar menu you get more bang for your buck. However, that is one reason why America is in such bad shape literally and figuratively. Obviously organic products are healthier for you than genetically enhanced ones. The cows that produce the normal milk we drink are fed steroids to be able to produce more milk than naturally possible. Therefore, we are not consuming 100% pure milk. That can cut down the natural nutrients we would be recieving if everyone housed their own cow. So, this article couldn't be any more incorrect by saying that America is worse off consuming organic products. If everyone decided to trade out a bag of Lay's for some all natural vegetable chips, consumption sizes would be cut down and health could be improved.",0

It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license.

Accordingly, we should also be able to choose to be free of religion when it impinges upon public health or well being. Permitting religious beliefs to trump science is antithetical to our secular culture.",0
1624,"The parents have chosen not to have their children attend public school, which the law allows. Having rejected the education at public schools, they now want to participate in a part of the systems which is superfluous to that educational purpose. They may pay taxes like everyone else, but the school does not receive state funding for their kids, but will have to expend very limited extracurricular funds on non-students. If they are allowed to participate, the family should pay for the privilege. Clearly these folks believe in having your cake and eating it too.",1
1625,"Gandhi said (more or accurately) 'I am willing to die for India's independence, but there is no cause I would kill for.' The gross immorality of modern war--war since Napoleon if not earlier--is that contestants are willing to kill for their cause, but not to die for it. The US killed far more people in Iraq than the 4000 or so Americans who fell there--the ratio seems to be tending toward thousands of civilians versus 0 soldiers. The drone makes the perfect war: they die (we don't know who), we live.",1
1626,i agree with these article because home-schooled children should have the right to play sports and venger into sports that they like. they should be allowed to play in sports teams to not only be active and do something they like but to also socially inneract with teamates. it would give them an oppurtunity to enjoy the sports and company of others around them. they pay school tax funds so they should have the right to play school sports and have a chance to further their abilities in the sport of their choice. just like tim tebow they chould become sports stats as well. why give up a chance like that?,0
1627,"The day guns are allowed into my college classroom is the day I stop teaching, and that feeling is shared by the vast majority of my faculty colleagues. American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly. A society in which each person is responsible for his or her safety is not a civilized one - indeed that is the very definition of barbarism. No, police cannot prevent every crime, but placing our safety in their hands is vastly superior to the alternative.",0

We regularly pay more for better seats at events, but if the price of my menu items increased between 7 & 9 on my busiest nights, or if I charged a premium for my best tables, I would be vilified. Charging a premium for the most desired reservation times seems to be the best free-market solution, but the premium should go to the restaurant,",1

They depend on society to produce their riches. In late-Victorian Britain, the argument was the opposite. Non-work income was 'unearned income' and was taxed at a higher rate. And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth. Under low capital gains tax (since the 1980s) growth was slower than in the post-war periods, when taxes were high. And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich.",1

I often (admittedly with some sarcasm) tell my teaching assistants that students who do well take credit for it, and students who do badly blame the instructor. That is not true across the board, but there is some element of truth in it. As for Rate My Professor, I am in favor of it, even with its many flaws (pointed out by other contributors to this debate). Like so many things in modern life (including elections), we have to go with the best of the flawed possibilities. Yes, some of the criteria are irrelevant and even ridiculous (the hot peppers). But if a consensus of ratings in criteria that actually matter are good, then a student is probably wise to take that class. If the consensus is bad, then take a different one. (By the way, I never check my ratings. I am way too busy! But I read the written evaluations my students submit very carefully. They are probably a better representation of the whole class.)",1

1638,"I agree with this only because the fees really are not explained well in the contracts, and are usually just one or two lines somewhere around page 18 of the agreement. These fees can ruin someone who doesn't know that he's over the limit. I have a friend who had to pay several hundred dollars in fees just because he and his wife made a few little purchases over a few days without realizing that they didn't have the money in their account. For someone making $2500 a month, $35 per transaction is a huge expense. I think what would fix the problem, though, is just not allowing banks to report nonpayment of checking account fees to credit bureaus.",0

For example, Hillary Clinton attended Wellesley College ...' Hillary Rodham graduated from an elite undergraduate institution whose name is Wellesley College. She made a conscious choice to attend, and it is worth saying that at the time she matriculated at Wellesley, other schools did admit women - Penn, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, University of Chicago, just to name a few. 'There is no data to support the myth that ... graduates [of single-sex colleges] are more likely to choose math-intensive career options.' Where are the non-data that support this assertion? I was under the impression that the students at women's colleges major in STEM fields at rates markedly higher than women on coed campuses. What those majoring in STEM fields do career-wise after graduation is, naturally, another issue, particularly today, when students have so many more careers that their parents ever did.",1

The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless.

I fail to see why those whose particular service happens to be delivering plates of food warrant their own method of compensation. One that puts an onus of extra calculation and deliberation on every single customer, every time they sit down to eat and relax.

The Quran says that married women should be discrete towards other men , it never said women should be covered from head to toes.

Perhaps one day this invaluable resource will succumb to virtual access alone: but that presents a clear disadvantage to many people for whom the local / regional / state / national library is an experience irreplacable by any virtual counterpart.

Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess.

One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it?

1684,I used to think the French were wrong to forbid hijabs in schools. But I am beginning to understand their position and agree with them. Muslims in Western countries must assimilate like everybody else. As long as they remain isolated they will be feared.,0
1685,Only problem with students is that they do not vote. Look s recently as states which have just had primary elections during spring break. The sands of Florida and the beer was much more important than to stay in their districts to vote. Don't count on them to bone of any help except the occasional rally as a relief agent to distract from classes.,0
1686,"Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all athletic venues and buildings occupied exclusively by coaches, staff and athletes. Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit.",0
1687,"I wish people be positive about innovating solutions like these for cars. We have to start somewhere! This invention might have it's flaws but so did the first car and the first airplane and so on. We have to give inventions of this matter a chance, so we can survive the scary thought of contaminating the atmosphere of our lovely planet. I love breathing, but I also love breathing clean wonderful fresh air. Don't you?",0
1688,"I find this answer scaring to the utmost extent. I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted.",0
1689,"Why bypass Charles? The succession is not a popularity contest. Nobody gave tuppence for George VI's chances when he came to the throne - the stutterer - yet he proved to be a good and decent king, who burnished the crown with honor. And the writer might want to check the veracity of the toothpaste story - it happened when Charles had a broken arm.",1
1690,"This is America, and we should not give in to political correctness to appease these fanatical Muslim thugs. If someone can burn the flag with impunity, show a crucifix dipped in urine, stage plays making fun on Catholics, deny the Holocaust, then he or she can burn a religious text. And the Muslims who seek to live in this country had better get used to it. Will the ACLU, that intrepid defender of left-wing and Muslim civil liberties, take up this case? I doubt it.",0
1691,"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how 'the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'' when our priorities are as skewed as they are. The taxpayers--and all those private donors--can afford PLENTY; it's what they're willing to spend it on that's the problem. I can't take someone seriously who claims, essentially, that qualified students shouldn't have affordable or free tuition because of football.",1
1692,"The rate's been dropped and we've been promised that that's all that was needed to 'unleash' the 'job creators'. Then we got further statements from the current-day Republicans that 'job creators are on strike'. Well, they've not been using their tax savings to hire the rest of us. Reagan fired strikers, yet this time we're expected to reward them even more? Tax cuts and deals for those who can afford to get most of their income from investing seems to prove one thing - they don't circulate as much of their income as the rest of us do. From the way things are running this far in to Bush's 'temporary' tax cuts all I can picture is a series of mansions with mattresses high in the air over all that frozen cash. Face it, Mr. Miron. There's no tax bar so low that some of the wealthy wouldn't pay bright people to find somewhere else with a lower rate. I'm picturing a land of negative taxation, and there they'd probably say they needed to be paid more by the populace.",1
1693,"Dual citizens are a big asset to any country, but especially to the US. Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.",1
1694,"Why shouldn't the US Embassy be moved to Jerusalem especially when it's Israel's capital? As a matter of fact, just about every other country should follow this as well. There are already a number of government offices in Jerusalem not to mention a number of reference books that acknowledge it as Israel's capital. The only reason why none of the embassies were in Jerusalem originally was because it was supposed to be an international zone according to the partition plan by the UN.",1
1695,"'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.",0
1696,"The wealthy have excelled at positioning their homes so they have the best views of the ocean, the mountains, the lakes, and the forests. Isn't that enough? Why do they fell entitled to prevent anyone else from access to our natural landscape? The Romans were right, public beaches for all!",1
1697,"As an ex school board member in Calif i was always so frustrated that getting rid of a poor performing teacher was impossible. Even tho they actually drank during school hours, fell asleep at their desk they were untouchable. We had to bargain with bonuses and increase retirement to get them out.We were not allowed to monitor their classes. Yes, the systems out of control and yes their are many who lost interest in teaching and hang on for years for their retirement.",1
1698,"The President is right when he says the critics won't call it Obamacare once the ACA takes the path of Social Security and Medicare, meaning once it's implemented it will be wildly popular (despite protestations that the sky is falling) which is, of course, the root of the fear from the author, and the conservative camp in general, because, at that point, it will be impossible to reverse.",0
1699,"I love national parks. Growing up in India, unspoiled green spaces were really foreign, and National Parks are America's best idea for generations to come. I visit Mt Ranier National Park several times as it is almost in my backyard. I am struck by the damage that visitors can inflict on the fragile wild flower meadows in their eagerness and zeal to enjoy the beauty. While better funding and visitor resources such as mass transportation could help, something we can all do is volunteer at a NP for a few days a year. This will go a long way in relieving the already stretched NP resources and the benefit to the volunteer citizen is priceless. Picking up trash, pulling weeks, cataloging wildflowers, roving the meadows helping visitors, etc. can help give back to our country's best idea and recharge our batteries all in one act!!",0
1700,"discussions like this are largely moot. the early states into the recreational market have surfaced and are working to solve the various (relatively minor) social consequences of full legalization; nationally, the social acceptance of fully legalized marijuana is increasing annually. as with other liberal trends of the past several decades, the outcome here is clear: eventual full legalization in most states. the drag here is federal drug and banking policy, which is sustained by conservative congressional sentiment. so what? another decade of laissez aller executive orders by a democratic administration will make it clear to everyone that there is very little to fear from marijuana the psychotropic -- once the problem of marijuana the illegal product is eliminated.",0
1701,"Having left NYC many years ago, I eventually came to live in a city of 40,000 that through the generosity of a patron secured the talents of the mid 20th century 'starchitects' and prominent firms. Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local.",1
1702,"It's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this proposal. Laggards and doubters can surely be brought around by the prospect of generous federal grants to develop ratings systems models and protocols and test them on various institutional cohorts. The primary goal of education is, of course, is to produce uniform and interchangeable cogs for the economic machine, so that it will hum smoothly and predictably. A college ratings system will extend the infallible testing paradigm into whole new realms, taking our country to heretofore unimaginable new heights of sameness. The wise sages at the Business Roundtable and the Gates Foundation will love it. The great successes of the primary and secondary school testing models can now be applied to the entire educational system. Victory is almost in our grasp.",1
1703,"I don't understand why a free women should curtail herself and wear an inconvenient headscarf out of solidarity. This reminds me of the Iranian 'revolution', where women did exactly that as a sign of solidarity for their headscarf wearing and mostly lesser educated combatants. We all know how this did backfire after the 'revolution' in 1979: there was no going back to not wearing scarfs.",0
1704,"People convicted of crimes don't lose their interest in how their class is treated. While the Constitution barred slave, women and who knows from voting, times have changed. Without those who know the unfairness of incarceration, the voter lists would be tipped in favor of those who want to continue the incarceration industry. Once released and encouraged to renter after paying their debt, how can they be denied the right to help select someone who might change the way society treats people who have erred?",1
1705,"Daly writes, 'our goal is to influence it [culture] by presenting a Christ-like example to the world.' When that so-called 'Christ-like example' includes raising millions of dollars, as Focus on the Family has repeatedly done, to try to restrict the 1138 rights and privileges conferred by civil marriage in this country to opposite-sex couples only, I have to wonder what Jesus Christ would have to say about that. I suspect he would react to Mr. Daly exactly the way he reacted to the Pharisees of his day, who presumed to have everything all figured out and lorded their supposedly superior knowledge of the infinite over everyone else.",1
1706,"Prof. Auyero says: 'The debate - if we can call it that - was not about logical, evidence-based arguments' As an Austinite who followed the debate in UT, I can attest that the university community abandoned all pretense of fact, logic and reasoned debate. In Texas, licensed citizens commit crimes LESS FREQUENTLY than sworn police officers! Facts, data, statistics - none of these were present in the UT debate.

Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring. The high turnover rate will only get higher if this new ruling prevails. Administrators and school districts in general need to provide ongoing support for new teachers in the form of mentors, aides, and constant feedback. It's a difficult job.",0

Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.",1
1712,"There's something really annoying about phrases 'integral legal mechanisms for small businesses', 'protect their intellectual property and confidential information'. This is spoken like an attorney who makes money off of 'protection.' Wen someone only comes from a position of 'protect', they rarely advance. Truth be told, most small businesses have little 'intellectual property' and little 'confidential information', and most employees are no so predatory as to be waiting to 'sell secrets.' Sounds like a Cold Way spy scenario. On the other hand, this is how some attorneys make their living an they are not going to bite the hand that feeds them. So short-sighted, the damage to employees while protecting the throne.",0
1713,"The basic argument against moving the embassy to Israel's capital, where it obviously belongs, is that Arabs will react violently. This is a case of the tail wagging the dog.

It should do the right thing.",1

The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.",0
1715,"Just like other kind of learning, how it's designed and delivered and monitored and revised in response to inputs makes all the difference. Through an agency that provides tutors to school districts, I currently tutor children who are not making adequate progress. They use an online learning website that provides remedial content supposedly tailored to their individual needs but most of them hate it and they seem more like chimps typing than kids learning to me.

1716,"'Just as there are good and bad refrigerators, there are good and bad professors.' Really? Anonymous on-line evaluations have been shown to be spurious. This is supported by published research and personal experience. Student evaluations of courses are strongly correlated to grade. Glaringly obvious when most variables are removed; e.g., comparing physics course sections covering identical material, taught by the same professor, in the same semester, and with the same assessment measures. NB, physics has the advantage that grades are based on scores, not potentially subjective measures, hence it was not the case that students' grades were influenced by the instructor's impression of them. More accurate measures are evaluations by trained, paid, identified peers and students. Education is a big investment - use evaluation tools that are robust, not junk.",0
1717,"Legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking are not mutually exclusive. The increased traffic in Amsterdam comes from the fact that it is just one such city and attracts men from all over. If prostitution was legal in every country in Europe this would not happen. Does prostitution dehumanize women? Absolutely. But until we get rid of it, legalization does, in theory, offer protections that doesn't currently exist.",1

Yes, there are probably some changes that need to be made but that has not been what is being said.

To say that salt is not offered at the table is Bloomberg Nannyish at minimum and downright control freakish. I long ago sought to reduce the salt in my diet and my taste has adjusted over time, but I have not eliminated salt nor do I intend to. Most baked or roasted poultry dishes are horrible without some added salt and there are other foods that cry out for it- popcorn is a good example. Having worked in healthcare for 27 years I have no illusions about the harm that a high sodium diet can have on some people. However, it is also possible to wisely reduce salt intake and still enjoy it in some foods. As the taste is highly subjective and individual I cannot agree with Mr Sbragg.",1

1721,"According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs.",0
1722,"The late Edward Abbey had a novel idea: allow anyone into a national park if travelling under their own steam -- walking, biking, skiing, etc. After all, getting out of the car is the best way to enjoy nature. As for the understandable complaints about children and the elderly not being able to travel in our parks under such a rule, Abbey replied that the kids will have their chances later (and we'll have preserved the parks for them), and the elderly had their chances when younger.",1
1723,"It might be worth taking a look at the CEGEP system in the province of Quebec. In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP. The students who are heading to university have had the chance to take courses more focused on their chosen field. Not everyone can or should go to university and the system CEGEP offers an alternative.",1
1724,"I'm amazed that so many of the comments on this piece seem to be comparing the usefulness of cursive to other forms of handwriting. I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.",0
1725,"Just as most sports and entertainment are leaving the realm of affordability for the poor and middle class, now some restaurants are going the same route of limiting their clientele to those with the most money.

1727,"The conclusion presented by Mr. Adams are not supported by the evidence. The recent economic meltdown, and the history of the tobacco, oil, and car companies (to name a few) show that large corporations are intrinsically unethical. Their objective is to make money, and other considerations are secondary. They are driven to regulate themselves only by the fear of economic sanctions brought by strong regulations - as Mr. Adams seems to admit. I would ask Mr. Adams to consider, for example, if industries would have self regulated to reduce acid rain producing emissions in the absence of a strong regulatory regime. Would coal mine operators self regulate to improve safety standards? I could go on with dozens of well documented examples. I invite Mr. Adams to visit several industrialized countries with weak regulations and see the effects of the philosophy that he proposes on the environment and living standards. Fundamentally, the only connection between Mr. Adams governance prescriptions and the real world is that, when implemented, they hurt real people. G.",0

1729,"Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing.",1
1730,"Muddled thinking here. Muslims so often point out with alacrity that specific clothing (i.e., covering) is not defined in the Koran, yet here we are exposed to a Islamocentric defense of rules of female dress that are designed to restrict a woman's freedom. These public displays of religion, from yamakas to burkhas are offensive to those who hate religious tyranny, but, alas, must be tolerated. But don't tell me it's done for feminist reasons. There's nothing feminist at all about the three Abrahamic religions, which, together with their oppression of women, are used to justify so much violence today.",0

Public education makes possible what we all live with in this Res Publica. Private education is a step back to the 17th century.

1734,"A core example of Kramer's argument is the Bush v Gore decision. The court anointed the head of the executive branch by first finding for Gore, but then not allowing the recount to proceed due to an arbitrary time limit the Court set.

MInorities like the super-rich, massive corporation-people, 40 senators, White House plumbers, or a president gone mad. If we agree a Court decision is wrong, changing the law or amending the Constitution can fix that.",1
1735,"Astounding, even mind boggling. Written by someone whom we have to assume is sincere, open and honest, it defies credulity to think that someone could honestly believe what is stated here. It's a massive denial of present reality and past statements, overt and covert. Tony Perkins, of Focus on the Family has said the United States is doomed if marriage equality ever becomes the law of the land. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson have said the most vile and hateful things about the LGBT Community for decades. Focus on the Family along with many other fundamentalist sects have long hidden their hatred under the mantra, 'Hate the sin, love the sinner.' They have enlisted every political strategy, collected hundreds of millions of dollars and enlisted the help of the rich and powerful to oppose every single advance in civil rights for the LGBT Community. An Op-Ed like this one that so denies reality does not advance dialogue, it shuts out dialogue. An Op-Ed like this does not shed light on truth, it only perpetuates fantasy. Declared or undeclared, Focus on the Family is a hate group and should be treated as such.",1
1736,"The problem I find, is many times there are things said in articles that are wrong. This puts a compulsion in many of us, that requires us to make sure the record is straight. Otherwise many will read something with no discussion and think the article is valid, when it's not. People often feel connected to an article and take it personally when something needs to be stated in a more clear fashion. I have often learned things from comment sections that added value or clarified issues that were not address in the article but should have been. The solution for bigotry and vitriol is not taking the voice from people. Censorship should never be allowed. There are several way to address this issue when it comes to forums.

I'm no fan of the prohibition of soft drugs but in the case of opiate, crack, and meth addiction, *enough.*",1
1743,"As long as he did it on his own time, did not use resources from his employer, and in no way represented himself as acting in an official capacity, he had every right to do what he did. I don't agree with what he did. But he had every right to do it. If employees are able to fire their employees for doing things off duty that the employer doesn't agree with, essentially we don't have a right to free speech anymore. We just have a right to speech that doesn't offend our employer, and that's not much of a right.",0
1744,"'Vaccines protect our neighbors -- like following traffic laws, drug tests at work, paying taxes -- they are a shared responsibility.'

1745,"Why no mention of the great communal living alternative, near-campus co-op housing? All the benefits of living in groups (diverse population and late night discussions included) and lower costs thanks to the residents taking on much of the upkeep of the building, cooking of the communal meals, etc. There are small co-op houses of under 20 and large ones with closer to 200 students. The best are part of co-op systems where the houses can benefit from economies of scale, residents are actually owners during their time at the house, and afford to hire some professional staff -- but students can have a good experience even with less-formalized independent group houses that are run co-operatively though they may technically be rental houses.",1
1746,"Yes, Steve. That's just how it works. My kids have been part time enrolled students at the local high school. They've taken chemistry and French, theater and music. They've been in marching band, color guard, acting, and chess teams as homeschooled kids. Homeschooling means the parents determine what educational tools best serve the interests of their kids. Savvy school districts happily include home educated kids when they can facilitate that education. It's worked wonderfully for us, in West Chester Ohio.",0
1747,"I was a library aide in elementary school, for Mrs Archer, who treated both books and people with respect. I still have the dictionary she gave me at the end of sixth grade, when I moved up to junior high school, and another library.

1749,"We cannot depend on private industry to instantly know the best way to intervene in a disaster. There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for - being cut off from supplies, having to work with only the employees that are able to show up, keeping track of things with no computers. This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not. But I'll take my chances with an experienced crew over even the best intentions of someone trying to figure things out as they go.",0

Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as 'career advancement' especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not 'capitalism.' Yeah, you never see a 'successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system' selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell...",0

There are only four ways a human being can procure anything in this world: Beg, borrow, steal, or, in a civilized society, pay for it. Anyone who thinks someone doesn't pay for sex has never been married. Period.",1
1752,"Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%).",1
1753,"'But I strongly reject the oft-heard accusations from the Left that opposition to whatever identity-politics goal it pursues can only be based in hate.'

1754,"Growing up, I was always a high academic achiever. Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in. Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs. I don't think you can make a blanket statement saying 'all parents should do this' or 'all homework help (or homework, for that matter) is counterproductive.'",1
1755,"The quality of reporting and the general knowledge of writers and editors has markedly decreased in the past 30 years.

Of course, many comments are of low quality and often historically ignorant but that is more than compensated for by the ones that are of very high quality. Democracy needs a comments section.",0
1756,"I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife. If you find such a man you can reap the same career benefits as your male colleagues who might marry a marriage-minded younger woman. If you want to be successful it is best to pass over the highly decorated, high maintenance males, unless you have decided that kids are not wanted. I also think success and power are attractive to both men and women and that a high status female can find younger partners relatively easily.",1
1757,"As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.",0
1758,"'We want the public to view judicial rulings solely as the product of law and legal reasoning, uninfluenced by political considerations.

1759,"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3' guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk.",1
1760,"Maybe part of this training would include to not withhold pain relief from those who suffer from conditions that are painful on a daily basis. It seems all the hysteria on the misuse of opioids has given rise to more government control in the doctor's office. The majority of patients who take these drugs take them responsibly. They do not take them for the high, they take them for just enough relief to help maintain normal function. Let's not make doctors afraid to take care of the suffering they encounter, let's help them learn to distinguish between the budding addict and the the poor soul who is legitimately suffering.",0

In my previous comment I forgot (in my anger) to mention my mother's crime: bowing to her family's wishes to find out what actually was wrong with her in case it could be cured by modern medicine.

1762,"Allowing foreign airlines to serve domestic routes is definitely something that doesn't get brought up enough. It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations.",0
1763,"Yes,America needs an effective intelligence agency in these times when their are large threats, continual crises, and highly technical developments to keep up with. We don't necessarily need the exact agency we have now. Give some of its staff and actions back to State and DOD. Require what remains to be absolutely disconnected from politics and totally law abiding. The director and his highest assistants should be prepared to resign the moment they are asked to partake of an illegal action, or one unjustified in defense of the country. Legal action for offenders would be mandatory. We don't need an agency to spy on other branches of the government and even the Congress in its own interest and then declare itself immune from prosecution. The present CIA is too big and too deeply entrenched in politics and Washington power blocs.",0
1764,"Legalising prostitution is only the beginning of a long process of emancipation. Succesful emancipation can not develop without legal acces to legally regulated prostitution; but very important is a process of cultural acceptance. As long as prostitution is looked down upon, full emancipation will remain impossible. But breaking down the illegality of prostituion is a vital pre -condition. I know the legalisation effects (of prostitution) in the Netherlands rather well, and believe me, after legalisation the complex problems related to low social status of the profession are not over. Legal regulation is, as I said, only a beginning.",1
1765,"As Truman stated so many years ago, 'It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.' Indeed, the CIA/NSA has become an all powerful, unaccountable, unconstitutional fourth wing of government in control of the Executive and running our foreign policy to the detriment of the world and of our basic rights as citizens. The CIA has always been above the law, uncontrollable and unaccountable. It is responsible for more crimes against humanity than any other organization or government, orchestrating civil wars, coups, establishing brutal dictatorships from Guatemala to Chile to Iran, training and overseeing death squads and torture around the globe. It is past time to abolish this monstrous institution along with its other faces; NSA, NATO, USAID and put intelligence gathering back in the military with heavy, independent oversight to prevent abuse. It is time to prosecute those responsible for international crimes and human rights abuse. It is also telling that the Times, know to be connected to the CIA, didn't have former CIA analyst Ray McGovern in this conversation.",1
1766,"I couldn't agree more, that parents should have a choice. it's america after all. HOWEVER, the school districts then must be allowed to reject the attendance of those unvaccinated students.

1767,"I am surprised by the naivete of many commenters and even some contributors. The business of NY is real estate and the banks that finance it. Much like the business of Washington is government and the business of Las Vegas is gambling. Real Estate taxes and the revenues that come from the construction of new buildings is the lifeblood of the city. It has been that way for at least two hundred years. Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades. The idea that somehow real estate interests are out of control or taking over how the city is run is perhaps news for 1815, not 2015. Without the millionaires and billionaires building and buying these fancy new places, New York would be Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a lovely place and if you prefer it, you should seriously consider moving there because NY is never going to be Philadelphia.",1

However there is a climate of intolerance in the country toward LBGTQ people and to deny that it is strongly correlated with religious belief and culture (primarily Christian) as it exists today defies common sense.

1772,It's terrifying. I know a lady who just got her degree in marketing at 42 years old and she wants to get into the field. But another employee mentioned that she has no experience and has no way to get a job.

The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it.

I assume your faith and god are exclusive and that the marriage conducted under the shinto faith would not be recognized, but somehow there is no move attempt to forbid civil law in these cases. The opposition is no more then bigotry and intolerance masked as faith, and your erudite sounding words clothe it further.",1

Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed.

Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times.

Even the future President of the United States gets to vote for himself. LOL. Really People I think it's sad how society takes the simplest things and makes them into a major issue.

Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)?

They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit. I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election. Further, if Justice Ginsburg is involved in a case that may present a conflict she would be expected to recuse herself.

Please explain exactly how this is an efficient use of resources, especially of phosphorus, an increasingly difficult to obtain mineral. Organic farming strengthens the soil with compost, reducing runoff, and unites the animal and herbal branches. Finally, the reckless use of antibiotics, purely to promote growth, has been proven to foster antibiotic resistant bacteria.

And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years.

Ultimately any intervention will mean that we will be the means to increase the slaugher of all non-Sunis and be no better than Assad himself.

1802,"As a recent MIT graduate, I feel I've seen firsthand what results when even the most brilliant college students don't sufficiently value humanities. I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us. Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point. Furthermore, unless engineering-types are required to take humanities classes (at a college level, not just in high school), many of them won't. This is an injustice to society as much as to those individuals, who may never realize what they are missing.",0
1803,"Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem. Also, even those who can make the elite teams can't always afford the fees.",0
1804,"I'm disgusted that this is even a question. Of course ANYONE who is a citizen has the right to vote! It is just sickening that partisan jerks from the GOP care more about gaining power so they can personally profit than they are about Democracy. Next, you fools will say you can only vote if you have a job, or own a house.",1
1805,"No imagination here. All electricity could be locally generated and distributed. Overnight charging will be very simple. Most shoppers and commuters and soccer moms will find the electric sedan more than practical, and it could be fashionably stylish too.

1806,"By all means voting should be a constitutional right. According to Federalist Paper 51, citizens are a part of the balance of power and are to exercise some leverage over all three branches of government. We currently have a Supreme Court that has prostituted our constitutional rights with its Greece NY decision allowing legislative bodies to prescribe sectarian prayers; the Hobby Lobby decision that gives non-living entities (corporations) the right to impose the religious beliefs of the owners over their employees First Amendment religious freedom rights, and the Boston decision that allows domestic terrorists to assault, harass and intimidate citizens who go to family planning clinics. This is an abuse of judicial power.",1

1808,"I learn quite a lot from NYT comments, often and in particular from thoughtful comments by authors who think differently from me. I find them valuable. I think the Times' general level of commentary is good. This in part results from the Times' curating its comments, which filters the merely shrill or ad hominem screeds. I recognize this also introduces curatorial bias, but for me, the reduction in noise is welcome. I hope the Times continues to solicit reader commentary. I think its system is working well.",0

If they can get the price point below $15k, they'll sell 50 million of them.",0
1810,"There is a simple reason that the EU should restrict the number of refugees, and it is the xenophobia of Europeans. I just don't think it is possible for Europe to absorb a large number of poor, dispossessed immigrants from a politically volatile part of the world without it leading inexorably to a rise in nationalism, and ethnic violence. This is not to say that Europe could not benefit greatly from an influx of immigrants ... it could. And it is not to say that Syrian refugees represent an outsized threat ... they probably don't. But as ISIS knows very well, all it takes is a few well-placed terrorist attacks to stoke the latent tribalism that lives just under the civilized veneer of Europe.",0
1811,"Abolish it. The math estimate is unjustified for costs of a citizenship registry are also unjustified. Just because it costs $600/baby now, does not mean it would cost $600 for every baby. Economics of scale, as well as most uncontested cases being far simpler, would surely reduce that cost substantially. It's time for a national registry for all citizens. Why isn't there only already? This is hard to believe. Isn't every citizen registered with the government already?",1
1812,"Students are not in a position to rate professors. Students are in the classroom to learn. I can't see how any professor who has a Ph.D. and knows his subject area cannot be a help to students whose work it is to learn. Yes, some profs are inspired teachers, great entertainers, dynamic lecturers. But some are boring, unimaginative, plodding. That's the way things are in the university and in life. A twenty-year-old who has a whole lot to learn about life should not be able to negatively affect the career of a prof. because he doesn't like that prof or the way he/she runs a class. Try giving out lots of Cs and see how you rate ( a grade, by the way that most students based on my experience deserve). If, as it happens, a particular prof is a terrible teacher, and a few are, word of mouth will determine the degree of success in his/her career. But the university should not invite criticism of its teachers by people who have only just learned to do their own laundry and fry an egg for themselves. Let the students work hard to learn what is being offered them.",0
1813,"RBG's opinion of Trump is not a point of law but a measure of her sanity and clarity. Scalia insulted whoever he wanted whenever he wanted to. Trump does not mention opponents without insulting them. Indeed he appears unable to do so. Besides, what if he is a faker?",0
1814,"Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections.",0
1815,"I personally think that any organization allowed to provide Press Cards to its employees should be required by the law to have a public section comment on its website. Think about it, people are being put in jail to protect the right of journalists. The least they can do is defending the freedom of speech of others, journalists need to be held accountable on that, a right without a duty is an oligarchic priviledge. They should be required to provide and sustain a space for open debate for any information they provide. Comments sections have fails because media failed them by treating them as after thoughts, and under investing in them. What's missing is a whole ecosystem of accountability as far as journalism and freedom of speech are concerned.",1
1816,"The first are broad patents on isolated DNA sequences, which cover the gene in something very close to its natural form. ' This is an example of something that shouldn't happen. What the body creates, even if someone extracts it, shouldn't be patentable. The DNA sequence is there for anyone to find with the proper technology. It's like picking fruit off the tree and saying I've 'discovered' fruit. This is crazy, but then we know that the ROBBER COURT will back business to the hilt. The Supremes are now one big legal joke, and I hope in the future we can manage to pass some legislation to limit SCOTUS judges to 10 years or less. Perhaps the term length of the president that offers them up for sale.",0
1817,"Buyer beware. Most comments pages are a dead zone. On the other hand, I love the NYTs comments - so insightful. I look forward to reading them and they are a significant addition to the piece. What is better than hearing what my fellow human beings (and NYT readers) have to say? There are several other sites that I feel the same way about. Other than that I just avoid them.",0
1818,"I taught at a couple universities. Often I'd be asked by parents of college age kids about where to send their kids. My quick response was usually, 'send them North to a school that does not have a winning football team. Poor athletics departments usually means better funding for everything else.'",0
1819,"As a prescriber, one of my most common experiences is patients' declining to take a prescribed medication because they look up the side effects and get scared. Most of the time this is unreasonable and reflects prior, dare I say perverse, reluctance to try something that might help. So, to quote Paul Simon, a man (woman) hears what he (she) wants to hear and disregards the rest. So I spend extra time explaining myself, which gets tiresome.",1
1820,"Of course all residents, regardless of background, are human beings and need to be treated like human beings. Identity cards help do that. But what would really do the most to uphold the humanity of everyone is to uphold the rule of law. You shouldn't be able to get a job without correct authorization to work. The reason is simple: unauthorized workers impact the labor market and drive down wages, especially for low skilled workers. Employers who hire unauthorized workers need to be punished so severely that they never do it again. Punishment for hiring unauthorized workers needs to be so frequent that behavior changes. Our millions of human beings living here who are unauthorized to work will either 1) become authorized or 2) return home to a place where they can improve their lives through work.",1
1821,"The professor writes: 'the ban is ruining the mood and spirit of the game. It's hard to enjoy any sports narrative if we don't know who is clean and who isn't.' why not get rid of professional sports and everyone just smokes a joint to enjoy an explosion of amateurism? In that way, our professor won't have his beautiful stories spoiled?",0
1822,"'Reality' shows ARE scripted - and the scripts bring even the skanks that 'star' in them to a whole other level. PAY ATTENTION, AMERICA!

They are all laughing at all of the viewers 'all the way to the bank'.",0
1823,"Pot may historically be correlated with increased illegal drug use. But perhaps the deciding factor isn't the marajuana, but the illegal activity: once you've done one thing illegal, it's easy to do more. By legalizing, it is no longer a gateway to more illegal activity.",0
1824,"edthefed is right. Shared values is not a sufficient reason to form an alliance. An alliance should also be mutually beneficial. Allying with Israel is not in the US interest. The problems that Israel helps the US with are mostly issues that are problems for the US only because we are allied with Israel. We should distance ourselves from both Israel and the Palestinians and pursue normal relations with other Arab countries like Tunisia and Oman on their own merits, not as part of a worldview that makes everything revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is central to Israel, but not to the US. Or, rather, the only thing that makes that conflict important for the the US is the alliance with Israel; ending the alliance ends the issue as a central problem for the US.",0
1825,"NATO's decline is irreversible. It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.",1
1826,"Making teachers more vulnerable to termination is bound to cause them to begin to actually try to teach. Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.",1
1827,"Immigration doesn't even enter the top 10 important issues facing this country. Crumbling infrastructure, a lousy medical system and public health, rampant inequality, the climate crisis - the list goes on and on.

1828,"I have been secular all of my adulthood. I was a kibbutznik. I am a labor Zionist; I am not a religious Zionist. When Bailey Smith was SBC president, he said 'God does not hear the prayer of a Jew.' Do you agree? Do you admire Jewish culture and Judaism, or only Israel for your own prophesies? What is your stance on Jews For Jesus - do you and your parishioners fund them? 'First, they believe God gave the Holy Land to the Jews forever' Evangelicals fund the Settlers and their politicians. They tell Settlers the bible justifies stealing from Arabs, and egg on Settlers into violent clashes with Arabs. The most recent was a near lynching in Jerusalem, of an Arab teenager. Hagee, a closet anti-Semite, has built West Bank facilities for Settlers only; Arabs are not welcome. Should we mistreat Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Should we expropriate property from Arabs in Brooklyn, or just Israel? Evangelicals support Jewish only developments in Israel. Should there be Christian only developments in the States? Carter and Obama try to be fair to both sides, and are excoriated for it.",0
1829,"Nope. I, a male, taught at an all girls high school in the 1970s. Then and now I realized what same sex education gives young women, and it ain't rocket science (although that certainly should be prominent in the curriculum). What these smart, no-nonsense young women learn is to EXPECT to be taken seriously, expect to compete on a equal basis with those around them, expect to get the prize when they actually win. Getting along with the boys is not the solution for the girls. It's the problem, friend, it's the problem.",1
1830,"Fletcher has got it exactly right. The best solution would be for both Elizabeth and Charles to abdicate and turn the Firm over to William and Kate. But since that will not happen, let's postpone until we're left with no choice the ascension of Charles--and even worse, Camilla. The thought of boring, stuffed-shirt Charles as king for decades is bad enough, but having Camilla shoved front and center would be a nightmare come true, even without the formal title of queen. Imagine-year after year of pictures of the two puttering in their garden with their little spades and shooting grouse at Balmoral. Oh, the horror, the horror-made even worse by knowing that Will and Kate are having to lie low. Of course, knowing the media's attention will gravitate anyway toward the young and vibrant, I feel a tinge of sympathy for the sad fate awaiting Charles and Camilla.",0
1831,"Yes, there is such a thingas as regulatory capture - companies find ways to manipulate rule-making bodies for their advantage to to keep out competitors. Without the existence of such rule-making bodies, they can't be captured - so companies find other ways to keep out competition. those ways are not perfect, of course, but then, comapnies are not always perfectly successful at regulatory capture. As usual as strict adherence to principle, whether libertarian or statist, is not effective in reality.",0
1832,"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear 'god will take care of us' or 'we have always found new sources of oil before' as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies.",1

1834,Columbia College allowed me and countless other lower income students to study at one of the great universities of the world for almost no tuition. I graduated from Columbia with no student loans and this has allowed me to practice medicine in rural Upstate New York. I will always be grateful to Columbia and I will continue to contribute money toward their scholarship fund. Why would you want to damage a great university such as Columbia with a new tax policy? The money I contribute helps other students from lower income families attend this wonderful college.,1
1835,"Change does start with the consumer, but how to educate the consumer? The US lags far behind other nations in media literacy education, which fosters critical thinking skills in viewers.

Kudos to Pozner for tackling the problems found in reality TV.",0

1837,"In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.",1

1841,"The solution is to tell illegals they are not welcome here at all. They are certainly not welcome here if they refuse to embrace the English language. They are the ones who must bear the costs of educating their kids in English, not us. A good start would be huge taxes on any money they think they should be able to send out of our nation. If these people want to be Americans, let them become Americans by demonstrating that English fluency is a priority and they will be the ones to pay for it not us.",0
1842,"And half right: Noise is a problem. But I don't want all these people around. My university had these big open rooms in the library. No they were NOT conducive to focused activity. I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery. And no, you're wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with me.",0
1843,"One of the horrible developments of the internet age is that people can actively avoid those topics they do not agree with or which cause them distress. One of the fundamental issues facing our society is that this avoidance of intellectual conflict leads to STUPID people, and an unwillingness to compromise for the betterment of society. Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS. The only thing I have to say about getting old is that it is likely I will be dead and buried before this country implodes in a holocaust of partisan hate. But it will come.",0
1844,"It is a no-brainer - of course college sports should be eliminated. They have nothing to do with education nor with college. They are simply money-machines and training facilities for professional teams. Ms. Tatum from Spelman is right on the money: college sports have nothing to do with physical fitness, except for the few so-called students who participate in those sports. The TV and sports betting world benefit far more from college sports than do the athletes.",0

I knew that Benjamin Franklin established the first on in this country (almost enough to let me forgive him for floating the ghastly daylight savings time joke in Paris a few years later) and Andrew Carnegie is the only philanthropist I've heard of to devote his fortune to the cause. I thought we had just done our fair share in keeping up with our responsibilities. I don't use the library often, I'm too fond of instant gratification in book stores and too undisciplined to return books on time, but I'm convinced they are a great value in our communities and support them willingly. I also have more internet bandwidth than most libraries. Books and DSL are expensive.

1848,"Seems to me that, well-intended though this proposal might be, there are some unconsidered and very serious unintended consequences that attend to it. Do we not understand that a program like this will have the effect of preventing many drug users from seeking medical attention when they need it? And would such a program apply to alcohol and tobacco users? Yes, I know they are legal, but they are still drugs, and in many cases every bit as destructive of a person's health, and certainly every bit as addictive, as many 'street' drugs. Would such treatment be 'forced' on people who are, say, simply casual users of an illicit substance? (Notwithstanding the hysterical anti-drug propaganda, in the case of most illicit drugs, there are indeed casual users who can use the substance recreationally without falling into the throes of addiction. This kind of approach would most likely result in fewer, not more, addicts receiving treatment.",0

There are on the order of 10 million police arrests per year, which means probably 4 times that in police interactions with the public. Of those arrests about 40% are black suspects so on the order of 4 million arrests of black folk/year. All of those arrests are adversarial, not many want to be arrested, and some percentage results in force. Now we have exactly one incident that resulted in an unjustified death. One out of 4 million puts things in a different perspective.",1

A better choice would have been to add sororities to campus life.",0
1856,"Sad but true, some people think that abstaining from casting their ballots is a meaningful sign of disatisfaction with the political class, or with both or one of the parties, or with the set of candidates that have been selected to run for office. What is true of abstention is that it means giving up the one right we all have, that if it's exercised by all or a substantial percentage of our qualified voters will make all the difference in attaining comitments to goals that are more compatible with the wishes as well as the needs of the majority. Therefore, I think that compulsory voting legislation is worth a national debate.",1

1861,'Should guns be allowed on campuses' is a perverse question. I would like to ask first: are guns allowed in colleges anywhere else in the world? Are more student dying there as a result of shootings? The answer of course is NO in both cases. Did anyone really need to debate about this? Just the idea that someone can think about something like this is sick and a sign of a dangerous deterioration of the expectations we as a so called civilized society have about each another. The other question is: why are so many shootings happening in USA campuses? Why are Americans in such pain that they need to overdose on opioids or/and shoot each other?,0

They would look at the long-term risks of originating mortgages without due diligence and refuse. We know how that turned out. Even Greenspan later admitted he was wrong, that business cares only about the next quarter and doesn't care how to get there. Sorry, the markets have spoken. Business cannot be trusted, no matter how much hot air their lobbyists spout. Regulation is absolutely necessary.",0
1863,"Quite simply, the Palestinian authority needs to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and Hamas (if they're a participant) needs to disavow its commitment to the destruction of Israel and the Jews. Until that happens, it's hard to see how any rational, objective person could support Palestinian statehood.",1
1864,"This is hilarious. All this high minded, theoretical pie in the sky. A Supreme Court Justice has the same free speech rights as anyone doing this discussion. Whose rules forbid it? Who enforces it? What would it take, and how long to impeach a Justice? The court is so political It could not happen. Look at Scalia, and pretend he didn't have a conflict with his hunting buddy, Cheney, and the Paladin type hunting club? Thomas has been involved with some obvious political pushes thru his wife. No conflict? Roberts and Alitho flat out lied in their pre-vote interviews. Stare-Decesious? Position on the constitution and abortion? They followed the GOP talking points to get around the objections. I know these pointy headed commentators, and lawyers, will disagree, but ask a hundred people on the street. You are discussing the number of angels dancing on a pin head, making about as much sense.",0
1865,"I went to a great public school as a child. Every term there'd be some new student in my class who'd just been expelled from a parochial school. Of course, the public school has to take those kids. That taught me as a child why private schools look like they have such a great success rate. They can kick out their lowest performers, while the public schools cannot. Looks like the same with charters, too.",1
1866,"I don't understand the hostility to homeschooling. How is it a 'threat to public education'? Hasn't public education set up enough of its own threats? Like, utterly unsustainable and irrational job protections for teachers regardless of ability or effectiveness? The way public education is now is itself a threat to our future standing in the world. I cheer on the homeschooling movement, hope to join it one day, and if a tax break will encourage more of it, great.",1
1867,"Dred Scott vs Sanford. I should probably end right there. But, yes to the question, I would still be ashamed--the (unjust) revisings of Law by the Justice's (or appellate judge's) command today are neither few nor small nor non-horrible. And don't forget that the guilded age was created, aided, and abetted by the similarly high-handed Lochner Court, damaging society by, say, effectively criminalizing unions (and letting employers enforce that by not-rare murders of any organizers) and many other things, for, what 40 years or so? Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression? And now we are told, in rulings that are nonsense when compared with the text of the 1st amendment they purportedly derive from, that 'money is speech', along with the power of rich and business over politicians? Oh--right, I was supposed to leave that one out. I would be ashamed. Dred Scott.",0
1868,This article is mainly about: (a) The health risks that the entire VEGAN population (both adults and children) face. (b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?!,0

Israel is a modern society, they had a female leader before the U.K. The Palestinians on the other hand follow racist and sexist poilcies.",0
1870,"What can we expect in our Cowboy culture? We celebrate power and violence; they are part of our national conscience. Endemic bias and the violence forged by it are logical outcomes of our celebration of subjugation. Additionally, we confuse courage with aggression--maintaining home arsenals in the name of protection is not courage; courage requires a willingness, if not acceptance, of defeat.",0
1871,"Most beach communities have public beaches and private land. I don't see why that's a problem, frankly; it is a problem if people begin believing that 'what's yours is mine,' unless you want people to then begin believing that your home is also theirs because they like it, or your living room couch should be theirs because it's 'welcoming.' Unless you're a communist; then it makes sense.",0
1872,"Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.",0
1873,"Regulation of corporations has been subverted by corporations. States that incorporate corporations are not equipped to regulate corporations that are rich enough to influence elections, are rich enough to muster a legal team that can bankrupt the state. Money from corporations and their principals cannot be permitted in the political process if democracy is to survive.",0
1874,"While I was getting my doctorate at Harvard, I wrote two articles saying basically the same thing Prof Bauerlein says here. In both cases readers attacked me as reactionary (Tea Partiers would likely call me a Communist) and argued for the importance of abstruse theory. Even though I have a PhD in medieval literature, I wonder if there's any point in saving the humanities at the university level. It's become a sewer. A sewer of fashionable theory. I remember one faculty member at Harvard proudly justifying the decision to give tenure to a woefully underqualified professor of Spanish literature on the grounds that the department 'needed' an openly gay professor who could teach about things like gay pride and gay rage. The two articles I refer to are: 'Apartheid in the Curriculum.' Harvard Magazine, January-February 1992, p. 14. 'A Crit of Lit: Teaching Literature in the Ivory Tower.' Perspective, vol. X, no. 3 (April 1993), 8 ff. Reprinted vol. X, no. 5 (summer 1993), 20 ff.",1
1875,"I have had many clients for the fifty years I was a Psychotherapist and now that I am retired at 88 I still have friends who know that I love them and yet because of my faith do not approve of the lifestyle. The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire. Most of my intelligent and gifted Gay friends agree with me that the Gays has created more of the problem than they are willing to accept or change. Gays want those of all religions and different persuasions of faith to feel, act, accept and welcome them when they in turn are not willing to act, accept and welcome those who do not agree with their life style. I believe a Gay person can be a good Catholic, as does the Pope. I believe a Gay can be a Christian, as do most of my friends in the faith, but I can ask a Gay to accept me as a sinner, imperfect and less than God wants me to be. I do not understand why a Gay has to deny that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin. Just accept that.",0
1876,"If taxes on capital gains were pushing capital to other countries, we would see elevated US interest rates. Since that is not the case, clearly US capital is not flying overseas. If there is a lack of productive investment, it is because demand for goods and services is depressed - why invest in new construction/capital goods/consumer products when millions of people are out of work and demand is low? We have a demand problem here - the solution is to increase demand - more gov't spending- esp on those who will pass a high % of the gov't funds on to businesses - i.e. the poor. This will stimulate demand - lower interest rates, not taxing capital gains is just pushing on a string.",1

1879,"Obama has made it clear that the U.S. makes its own policy. He's refused to be wagged by the dog. He reversed George W. Bush's policy of supporting permanent annexation of the settlements and returned to the formula that the rest of the world supports: a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. I would say that Netanyahu by his gratuitous insult and ham-fisted meddling in U.S. politics, has lost his influence with the U.S.",0
1880,"Not only is broken windows policing effective at preventing minor crime, and doing so at far less cost and risk and with lesser punishments, but it contributes strongly to the quality of life, and that shouldn't be underestimated. A boom car isn't as serious as a drive-by killing, but try getting work done on Saturday afternoon when the guy across the street is driving one. We need to prevent major crimes, but we also need to maintain a livable, civil environment in which to live our everyday lives.",1
1881,"One of the sad consequences of this admission problem is that students attending out-of State Universities are more likely to find internships out of State and eventually jobs out of State. While this is not life threatening, nor completely negative, it does have a personal impact (somewhat like emigration)",1
1882,"I would like to suggest an additional choice. If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.",1
1883,"By beginning with the proposition that we should stop taxing capital gains, the New York Times ('Room for Debate,' Aug. 16) foreshortens the options that would--in a world not vacuumed of reason by Cato Institute shibboleths--be available to policy makers and the voting public. It would be funny if it weren't so drearily predictable. 'Should we stop taxing capital gains?' One may as well ask if we should stop prosecuting financial fraud. It's the same joke, see?

I have a $10k deductible and every time I go to the dr.

Any day now they'll be a lithium cartel forming in the image of OPEC and we'll be in the same bad situation. Hydrogen is the best solution. Talk about the lack of infrastructure for Hydrogen is just defeatist nonsense designed to maintain the status quo for the good of those who profit from it. Nobody used the lack of public charging stations or the lack of infrastructure for disposing/recycling used batteries as an excuse to stop the Batteries. In a decade we transformed the landscape with cell towers and converted our society to a mobile one and we can do the same with Hydrogen.",1
1886,"Profiling is the primary tool of crime prevention which is actually what the police are supposed to do - prevent crime.

Unfortunately, profiling tells us more about the criminals among us than we, apparently, really want to know.",1
1887,"The reason many Americas feel low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens is the decline of moderate living-wage jobs. Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay. No one complained that they were stealing work from citizens.",1
1888,"Totally agree on difference between perks and policies. To me policies are super important to both my own morale and my actual productivity.

1891,"The majority of gun-toting activists, like this one, like to act as if they want to arm us all out of great concern about rapists and predators, which is a heartless tactic to get more women on their side. Yet, the fact is more guns and gunowners result in more harm to women, most often in domestic violence, something a decent professor of law should know. And most college women would not realistically be at an advantage even if armed at the fraternity parties, where preying upon them often occurs. Perhaps he should try to replace some of those in the growing exodus of more thoughtful professors from UT, where he and his students could soon defend one another and even potentially have a good ole shootout with one another should tensions arise in Austin. The claim that 'armed citizens frequently save lives and prevent violent crimes, often without firing a shot', is largely a myth and not backed up with any valid stats, though it is true that most law-abiding gunowners have a dream about saving others ironically from fellow gunowners at some point, and it may seem like a nice dream.",0

Or one of our two poltical parties which represents nearly half the population postulating that the cure for our financial crisis is less regulation, etc. The list of stupid and crazy things that litter our current landscape are just too great to even begin to enumerate. Yes, I know people today cannot be openly racist, war-mongerers, etc. Do you really believe that our 'smart bombs' and 'smart phones' make us smarter? It's true that thanks to some very smart individuals we have progressed scientifically but let's not confuse this with human progress. In spite of your counter-intuitive optimism we are just as likely to destroy the planet and ourselves 'by accident' today as we were twenty or fifty years ago.

1894,"This entire conversation gives me heartburn. I am a college teacher who, yes, has entries on Rate My Professor and who works for a college that overtly cites the website when lauding the success of its best teachers. So I pay attention to the public discussions of student evaluations. The heartburn comes not from fear that my rating index is too low but rather in the assumptions of both sides. The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites. As mentioned by at least one commenter, ratings suffer from selection bias and from a failure to use common terms. Those with strong opinions for or against are more likely to evaluate an instructor and what raters see as strict or smart or easy or dumb is so subjective that any two raters may have opposite definitions of the same word used in a rating. Not a good combination: an unrepresentative sample using uncommon terms to rate a product.",0

To me, real manliness is a guy who takes responsibility, who supports and protects his wife and children, who stands up for others, who does the right thing in the face of difficulties, who doesn't whine and complain about his life but instead carries on with dignity and compassion for others....someone who walks his talk. In other words ... he has a code.",1
1899,If we were to eliminate tax breaks to private colleges and universities there is no guarantee those funds would be directed to public schools. The whole argument is a red herring. The bottom line: Our schools need all the help they can get.,1
1900,"The SAT essay has been made optional so that college doors remain open that would otherwise be closed to the non-literate majority emerging from today's secondary schools. We need only consider the letters written home by the relatively uneducated soldiers of the Civil War, the power of which only a minuscule percentage of today's high school graduates (not to mention so very many in college) could hope to equal. Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments. An impossible proposition. What is required is a reduction of class size to no more than twenty. As any language educator worth her/his degree and job knows, that is the maximum class size for effective language skills development. Are you laughing already? Of course. In what world is that ever going to happen?",1
1901,"One of my best friends is a Chief of Police in a small suburb of a big city. Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)",1
1902,"I do agree that there is a downside to globalization when it comes to fashion. I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect.",0
1903,Fear and hysteria has worked wonders on the US public that now welcomes the fact that all their communications are intercepted and recorded and that there is no right to privacy here. They seem flattered to think that the government both knows and cares what they think and say. Vile and disgusting. I would never imagined that we would come to this.,0
1904,"NOWHERE did Justice Ginsburg make any political statement whatsoever. She is stating a hypothetical, which is something that happens constantly in courts and in legal discussions every day. Hypothetically, if Trump were elected, she would hypothetically be confused, wish to leave the US and hypothetically wish to live in another country. Now had any judge said, I would advise any sane person to vote against Trump or to remain in the US if he's elected, that would clearly constitute political speech advising others and would most likely be unacceptable. Whether it were legal or not depends on the context. In conversations with family members and close friends, Justices are afforded the same rights of free speech as anyone else. Beyond that, speaking of hypotheticals is the safest choice.",0
1905,"As a psychologist, I would like to point out that while there are certainly abuses with psychiatric drugs, I see the opposite in my practice. Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.",0
1906,"In my experience, those with trust funds could afford to work the unpaid internships that lead to full-time jobs.

1907,"What we should be looking for are fairer opportunities and more equal outcomes. Race-based admissions are not about outcomes but about a preference. It's revanchist - plain and simple. It's taking away slots from low-income white kids with high aptitude and giving them to middle-income black kids with mediocre aptitude. It's punishing them for something they had nothing to do with. If you can't understand that then you'll never understand the powder-keg of white resentment in red state america. Poor kids deserve a leg up because being poor saddles kids with a whole host of disadvantages that they didn't ask for. To say that rich, black kids deserve a leg up because they're black shows a serious lack of a sense of irony.",1

For this reason I'd much rather have the food be undersalted and have salt shakers at the table where I can add just enough salt to taste, but no more.

1912,"For a long time, it's been a role of Supreme Court Judges to announce actions or laws unconstitutional. Although Ginsburg was not necessarily performing an action her job requires, in her experience, she knows what is unconstitutional.

1913,"What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so.",1

How about we cut out the chalk and dry erase markers and why are we bothering with teaching reading when we can get digital text to voice anyway? And have you even tried to read some of the crud these kids write? We obviously are not teaching writing so why should we screw up the budget by trying to start now. Isn't it enough the schools are keeping these hooligans off the street a few hours each day and keeping them from trying to get work cause if they did those unemployment figures would look even worse.

I don't disagree that some institutions could be hurt by this, or that a college education isn't 'worth it', but debt levels are nothing what our generation dealt with, and the 'worth' of it all does not serve students whose institutions can't get them jobs, and/or accept/graduate them when they truly are not [yet] qualified.

1919,"I wish my physician had consulted Dr. Google before prescribing a fluoroquinolone to me a year ago for a simple mosquito bite that develped a minor infection.

In fact, within an hour of taking one pill, my knees became numb. I discontinued the drug but the numbness has not gone away. The tools available through allopathic Western medicine are flawed at best. Most of our drugs have questionable value and all have side effects. Treatments manage symptoms without offering cures. They keep patients in treatment for decades. Most doctors are hampered from freely applying even those flawed tools by the strictures of insurance companies and practices which limit office visits to 15 minutes. It's medicine practiced by accountants, not doctors. And unfortunately, many doctors are simply not very good. So IMHO, Dr. Google deserves a place in the exam room.",0

I suggest that a due process argument applies. While criminals were sentenced under due process, the removal of voting rights was attached not by the court but by the legislature without reference to the particular case. If illegal action is thus punished, should we include traffic offenses? Late filing of taxes? Disenfranchisement seem an unusual and arbitrary punishment and is not handled by the judiciary to whom the constitution gave the authority in sentencing. Star Ship Troopers was a dreadful, great movie: but it held that the right to vote was earned by military service. In America, the right is not explicitly defined but I suggest that it is implicitly based on citizenship and felons remain citizens. You may not like that they can vote, but that should hold no greater weight that your dislike of that idiot down the street with all those dumb signs in his yard.",1
1921,"My company pays interns $10 an hour, and they often are required to do very menial work. That said, interns who show eagerness and promise may be offered full time positions with the company. For-profit companies should absolutely pay their interns. The small investment is an incredible bargain when you consider it a screening tool for potential employees. Several full-time members of my department started out as interns. I can say from experience that it's a far better screening tool than a job interview, and worth every penny. I think unpaid internships are fine, but in limited circumstances--for example, if the student is still in college and can get academic credit. In this case, though, you'd want to make sure that the student is getting training and is not forced to do menial tasks. I had some internships like this in college and they were very beneficial. I also think that non-profit organizations should be able to offer limited unpaid internships. In all other circumstances, internships should be paid, and interns should at least receive minimum wage. If for-profit organizations can hire unpaid interns, there's too much potential for abuse.",1
1922,"I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.",1
1923,"'K-12 teachers with tenure do not have a job for life. What 'tenure' means, for them, is due-process procedures for dismissals with cause, instead of capricious or at-will dismissal from their duties.' If that were the case, then I don't think the union busters like Welch would have such an easy time finding popular support. Most thoughtful people would support tenure if it did simply mean due process. But it is so hard to dismiss bad teachers and children's educations suffer. Dismissing all protections isn't fair, but the teacher's unions brought this upon themselves by refusing to entertain any flexibility with regard to evaluations and dismissals.",0
1924,"I absolutely agree with this article. The Teach for America program needs to have their teachers in the classroom a whole lot longer than two years in order to make a critical difference. Without longer teaching commitments, teachers in the Teach For America program will not be able to improve their skills and children will continue to suffer the consequences. Would a five year Teach for America commitment change things?...I believe that's a start.",1
1925,"It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like 'oh yes, we should be doing a better job' of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about 'doing a better job' they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do 'a better job' that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with 'anti-vaxxers' and 'junk science' is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent.",1
1926,"I have been vegan for 29 years, and i am fitter and healthier than any body that i know, most of all the meat eaters. the article seems flawed at most completely inaccurate, to say that a meat eater is going to be heather is laughable, as most are over weight or obese, have higher cholesterol levels and a multitude of diseases related to high fat levels in their diets. in short it was the best thing i could had done at age 19.",1
1927,"I know of too many kids put through too many years of high school, utterly frustrated at the system. Usually they take as many AP classes as possible, or take the GED and go to college early, or if the system allows, spend half days in high school and half days in college. Another one I know completed college at night and summers while attending days in high school.Nearly all had to 'fight the system' to do this. Why should all of this be made so difficult ? Why can't these choices be an available option to all, instead of foot-dragging, paperwork-filled, unending office meetings, interminable official resistance , with insane remarks like 'but they will miss the senior prom', 'readiness', 'socialization' etc. They want out. Let them go.",0
1928,"Conservatives make me laugh when they struggle to keep their kids from learning evolution. What they're going to end up doing is keeping their children from having careers in science. Since I'm a liberal, that doesn't sound too bad to me. It keeps the competition down. People who don't accept evolution don't belong in science anyways. The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages you're handing to those kids whose parents aren't as nearly controlling and obsessive and ideologically blinkered as you are. So there is a free market solution to this problem. Maybe the Cato Institute should study that angle before they issue their next statement on the topic.",0

1930,"Necessity is the mother of all invention. Never bet against human ingenuity, especially when survival is on the line. The technology we need to move beyond fossil fuels exist today - wind, solar, efficiency improvements like LED lighting, and especially nuclear power. I can't imagine what technology we will have in 50 years - carbon sequestration, fusion reactors, space elevators, orbital solar platforms - there is no point even guessing, but I am very sure technology continues to outpace population growth, and we continue to solve problems faster than we create them. We might be slow on global warming, but science and engineering are key to survival. As Issac Asimov said, 'I chose solution, I chose technology'",0
1931,"Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.",1
1932,"There is a difference between doing the homework for them and helping them understand the principles. A parent should never do the work for them, but should help with understanding when required. establishing good study habits and monitoring results. Our children were completely different in dealing with homework. Our son was a last minute kid and our daughter started as soon as she got the assignment. Both did very well in school and have successful careers. They were just different and our goal was to assure they got their work done and understood it.",1
1933,Tips are a not-so-hidden cost of dining out. They are a slap to the customer after the bill has been presented. They are an insult to both the customer and to the server. Frankly I do not like the feeling that I am obliged to supplement the wages paid to the server so that he or she can have a decent living. That cost should be part of the cost of the meal. Wait staff are properly the employees of the restauranteur - and his responsibility.,1
1934,"Who has the time? When the kids are are of school age, the parents - usually both - have their noses to the grindstone. It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.",0
1935,"Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities. The error here, as Professor Nussbaum says, is in assuming that the two areas of study are unrelated and separable, which they are not. The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society. That ignorance extends to those who are leading the reactionaries. They also stand in great need of education in such skills as critical thinking, and in the narrative and conceptual history of their own nation.",0
1936,"The manly men I know don't eat bacon cheeseburgers or drive SUV's. But they have plenty of strength, ambition, and, yes, even love and compassion. I'm not ready to give up on the male species yet. But I could do without all the smartphone addictions.",1
1937,"I agree with other posters here that it is ludicrous to even consider putting Western troops on the ground in Syria, when it's been reported that Syrian male refugees outnumber female refugees 5 to 1. Out of a projected 1 million expected migrants to Europe by the end of 2015, that could amount to a pretty large fighting force. Why do we have to continually sacrifice our own young people in other nations' wars? We're tired and spent, both morally and fiscally. Let the Islamic world deal with its totalitarian brethern, if it really desires to.",0
1938,"Unpaid internships reserve vacational educational experiences and pre-professional development for children of the rich. This advantages them over those who have to pay their own way through university education. As one who spent summers on factory assembly lines while my classmates interned in museums, I am opposed to any kind of unpaid work for college and high school students. Voluntarism is a cheap cop out for employers and it should be strictly controlled and monitored.",1
1939,"If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns.",1

1942,Most (American)parents do not realize that sucess and money flows from a good education. The most sucessful ethnic groups do not strive for wealth it flows from having well educated children. And the thing that goes hand in glove with that thinking is that it is ultimately the parents job to see that their child is learning and getting a good education and not leave it up to schools. The teachers and administration will still be recieveing their collective paychecks long after your kids have moved on.,0
1943,"Yes, doping should be legal, even encouraged. Then clever bio-chemical manufacturers can make money, hiring people and creating new performance enhancing compounds.

And we all know that is good. It will all enhance economic growth which is the really important thing. So drugs uber allies!",1
1944,"I am fully insured on my own and help finance Obamacare too. And I don't regret. Such obligations are imperative for a civilized society and a nation. These obligations pale in comparision with,( like all citizens do),the benefits, advantages and rights I enjoy at the same time. In fact, what I want is a far less complicated, straight-forward, far more liberal and universally applicable health care system that is at least comparable to what are obtaining presently in France,UK and Scandinavia.I don't mind the personal costs,no one should, I believe.It is the basic minimum that any nation should render to its citizens.And it could prove to be quite cheaper than whatever provided by any insurance company and far more efficient, if wisely administered. Anyway, I personally believe, ofcourse buttressed by my own calculations and ratified by my intellectual friends, that the rich are indeed the free loaders in any society, extracting far higher benefits from it than what they themselves contribute.But they make the maximum noise and grossly distort the reality for denying the middle class and the poor what they richly deserve-- through rational logic and by canons of progressive civilizations.",0
1945,"The best way to spur economic growth is to eliminate taxes all together. That way, we get things like roads, schools, security, and healthcare for free, and the money saved will provide a big stimulus to the economy. Something for nothing; it is a beautiful American story, isn't it?",1
1946,"As political calculus Pres. Obama's willingness to risk sacrificing the east coast is absurd. Where does a substantial part of the base of Democratic party live? What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks. Imagine a double whammy: a well head blowout or underwater pipeline rupture or an Exxon Valdez size tanker disaster combined with a hurricane Sandy. The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude. If both our major parties are willing to risk such a disaster just to keep fossil fuel producers and financiers happy, then it really is time for a third party to emerge and offer a platform of peace and prosperity without planetary ecological collapse.",0

Orwell was right about almost everything, including his idea about perpetual war. Ever since Vietnam the United States Congress doesn't vote on a war. The chief executive and commander-in-chief decides to start flying the bombs, and they start flying, and people start dying. Will a war in Syria let some pressure out of the pressure cooker, or will it explode into World War III? The military-industrial corporations and cable TV stations will rake in the big dough (again!) when the bombs start flying. The lies and cover-ups are catching up with us. The truth about the saying what goes around comes around is true. America the beautiful... The foundation and working apparatus for an electronic-military police state are here.

1948,"I think that with the vast amount of resources available on the internet, it's vital that we continue to assign research papers. But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.",1

1951,"'The Massachusetts judiciary retains the power under equity principles to reform such agreements when circumstances indicate that they may be impractical or unfair.' That, of course, assumes a former employee can afford the cost and hit to his reputation for bringing lawsuit against a former employer for an onerous non-compete. You mention these agreements protect the business owner, but I fail to see how they benefit the other party in the agreement, the employee, one iota. A more equitable arrangement would be to require the business owner to pay a premium for preventing his employees from selling their services in a free marketplace.",0

A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs.

Thomas makes speeches that, thankfully, are not well publicized but nonetheless express his opinions.

One of the important lessons learned in schools is that we are different, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. We are setting our children up to be unable to adapt to change. Speaking as a teacher, we are also making teaching an even less appealing profession. We already have to accodomate and modify based on IEPs and languages, and mandated testing. What other profession gets so much input from those outside the profession? Do people go to their doctors and tell them how to treat their problems? Give advice to their lawyers or accountants? Teachers are professionals and should be treated as such. Many of us have masters degrees and just want to work with kids, to help them learn and grow. We are impeded in that by so many factors, and this law is another one.",0
1968,"This is the one post that I agree with. The humanities are that: a human endeavor. Language is probably the most important thing we do, both physically and mentally. It's what makes us human. Ultimately this takes us back to a question the Greeks often asked: what's a good life? What's rewarding, what's fulfilling? These days we all live relatively well, compared to our ancestors at least. Is it absolutely necessity to think purely in terms of utility? I have an HDTV, is it absolutely necessary I have a 3dTV tomorrow? Why? Studying languages and being able to communicate successfully gives insight into culture, gesture, and structure; how is that not useful? I study languages on a daily basis, and I'm not that good at them as I get older.

And who are these 'cost-conscious consumers' driving down the prices? I can see it now. Hey honey, doc says I have brain tumor. Let's call around, see where I can get the cheapest surgeon. Avoiding 'wasteful medical care' is a euphemism for not being able to afford medical care and so not receiving it. Over sixty five? Can't get the care you need with your 'cash-transfer'?

I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.",1
1972,"First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either.",0

1974,Dismantling tenure suits the reformers and supports the meme that teachers are ineffective and that some outside force (in this case the courts) must oversee decisions made by educators. It is truly unconscionable that conservative think tanks like the Fordham Institute and their staff of political scientists are dismantling the few employee benefits that teachers receive.

Parents who are controlling and want their child to be the next great athlete, musician, or nobel winner will take this article to heart and say they are 'good' parents...but just how much control is good? As Yan Sun noted, we are losing creativity. I teach at a university where a simple question of 'what do you think' brings no response, where the students have a look of 'what is the right answer' or 'what answer does she want' written across their face. Their opinions are handed down to them, their religion and political ideology is dictated to them, their career choice is already decided for them...how sad to not be able to do what you love but what your parents want you to do. Guidance not control is the answer to a well rounded child.If all decisions are made for you then you never learn to make a decision. Childhood is about learning and then spreading your wings for flight.",1
1977,"I think the issue that we ought to be able to agree on, is that birth right citizenship has to end. The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders. Civilization and civilized behavior breaks down in the face of desperation. Accepting unlimited immigrants from around the world would not improve the lives of those left behind. Who is responsible for helping them?",0
1978,"The question was: Is the world becoming safer? I grew up in a time of air raid drills and ducking-and-covering under my desk at school. A time of the Missiles of October, when the whole world held its breath to see whether the Russian fleet would turn from the blockade. We may have small scale conflict around the world, but we don't have children hiding under their desks anymore, or wondering whether that siren they hear means Russian bombers are on the way.",1
1979,There are no saints. We do what we do because it's gratifying. We are compassionate because it feels good. We are nasty for the same reason. That includes the woman who thought it was a good idea to withhold pain meds because she wanted the dying to suffer. Mother Teresa was a sadist.,0
1980,"'Marijuana Is Now Big Business' Wrong - marijuana has been big business for decades. The California Dept. of Agriculture has listed it as the number one cash crop in the state for over 20 years in a row. Now, the business is above ground, where it should be. Regulation, taxation, better education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs - everybody wins. We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful jailing of American citizens since slavery. It can't happen quick enough.",1
1981,"i assume the 'microbio' declares my background and competence and avoids unpleasantries known to have occurred to others in the current highly polarized environment.

I understand that well thought out ideas and even humor will be remembered longer than a rant and trust the NYT editors will view those with lasting value favorably in their posting decisions.",0
1982,"'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money. They did not have to earn or borrow it. There is a tendency for them to withdraw from a class. Free public education impacts the ability of non-profit private colleges to exist. What happens when these institutions crumble? Do state schools have the capacity to pick-up non-profit private school students? Can we afford 'free' across all college students? 'Free' excites us. If it sounds too good to be true . . .",0
1983,"She does not deserve the honor. She terrorized people into her religion if they were dying.

1984,"Comments sections provide an important outlet for people who may not otherwise have a sounding board. Though it may be true that truly illuminating comments are few and far between, there is value in people being able to voice their opinion. Of course, there are people who take advantage of it with vile comments, so that is why we need quality moderators.",0
1985,"In all honesty, if I were a published author (as I aspire to be someday), I might not want to read even the good comments about my work. I do know some authors who do not read either the good nor the bad. That, to me, is understandable. However, why should the rest of the world feel the same way? If someone wants to offer an insight - and other people read it and get something from it (whether or not the original author gets involved), why deny that basic right to free speech? There will always be bullies, online or in the real world. You cannot stop them completely, but to not allow the general public to have discourse because trolls exist, then why write anything in the first place? You may as well keep it in diary form, to be seen by no one by yourself.",0
1986,"Wealth is not money. Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.",0
1987,"I've always enjoyed watching the Olympics. It's an opportunity, albeit a huge spectacle, to remind us that we're all on the same planet, where we can compete on the field with sport, not war. Brazil is one of my favorite countries, with a rich culture and a special joie de vivre not found in many other places. It's unfortunate and sad that their political problems have brought the situation to where it is now....but, political corruption is not really anything new, and not limited to Brazil. I've lived for years in dangerous mosquito zones (zika, chikunguniya, dengue, malaria) and stayed healthy by taking preventative measures. Olympic goers need to be educated about how best to prevent mosquito bites, the place needs to be sprayed, and an easy test people should be readily available for people returning home. Furthermore, the Olympics represent the dream of a lifetime for all the athletes who train so hard to get in. Let the games go on!",1

1990,"I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those for the world. Perhaps the difference is the kids were well behaved? From looking at these posts, it seems alot of parents are extremely anxious to get away from their children. I think getting away for a romantic weekend sans children is great- but for big 2 week summer vacations, I would find it unthinkable to go without the children and to have them miss this experience. I would think this sends a message to the kids that you really don't like them very much- perhaps theyre right.",1
1991,"I am sorry but I agree. I love books and libraries. However, my kid being in elementary school, and having Library as special subject (along with music, gym, art, computers), I often think he better had a foreign language or something else instead of Library. The teachers already teach regularly the students about books and authors, and help them in this domain, in addition to very accessible local libraries and children librarians.",1
1992,"When I first read Justice Ginsberg's comments earlier today, I was initially surprised that a sitting supreme court justice would give her opinion on a presidential candidate.

1993,"It's funny that liberals would endorse government ID programs, but times have changed. When I was young in the late '70s and early '80s, I was adamantly against any type of mandatory government issued ID. I was then and still am a liberal/progressive individual, and I have always been pro-privacy rights. But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel. The only reason to oppose a national ID is because you want to ensure that people here illegally can still participate in all functions that a citizen can, and that's not a good reason.",1
1994,"After 35 years as a college professor, I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster. This is an environment in which young people, often for the first time in theri lives, are trying to navigate their way through the world at large. Examinations, personal relationships, and other factors create stresses, in some cases more than they can cope with. I would not like to face a student who feels aggrieved about a bad grade in the likelihood that they might have a firearm under their jacket. Nor should in classroom discussions, often heated at times, be conducted under such an environment. No, college is a place where children come to become adults, and minimizing threats of violence is one of the controls that we need to make to make this passage safer.",0
1995,"I agree it will be a useful tool, to deport them. First identify all the people who have ignored the immigration laws of the US and then quietly deport them so they can be reunited with their families back in their country of origin.",1
1996,"This statement by the author: 'One concern is that releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes could even make the dengue situation worse, perhaps by reducing immunity to the more serious form of the disease.' is not entirely accurate. The study cited (the link is kindly provided) actually indicates that a vaccination program should be conducted before releasing GM mosquitos in places with high wild type mosquito density. Otherwise cases of a lethal form of dengue fever could increase. The paper does not state that releasing GM mosquitos actually makes matters worse in a general sense. In fact, the modeling presented in the paper shows that combining the two approaches (vaccination and GMO release) reduce both types of dengue fever, much more than one or the other treatment used alone. I admire the use of peer-reviewed research to substantiate arguments, but the author has the responsibility to do it properly.",0
1997,"Just as their housework will be given over to servants, much of their childcare will be given over to nannies. I am sure they won't be ignoring the kids, but I am equally sure they won't be overwhelmed by the day-to-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, pressures of parenting either. Royal or not, there are too many billions between the Windors and the average family.",0
1998,"This is hardly a 'first generation' problem. For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem. The constant distractions, visual and aural, of a badly designed open plan can, in a moment, put you right back in square one. Repeat until end of day, every day, and see how productive you are.",1
1999,"Oh please, they're inducting KISS! This is not greatness, not deserving of being inducted. The RRHFA inducts too many people because it is an annual event and they need the buzz to get people to visit and keep museum viable. If they were really serious about the contributions to the genre they should only induct every 5 years. They've tossed in too many people on the periphery and diluted the value of the induction.",1
2000,"I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that 'Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved.' As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN",1
2001,"Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible. The library and information sector plays an important role in providing public access to networked information. Public libraries worldwide are a significant component; by ensuring that there is equity in access to information (for both educational and recreational purposes) through the provision of quality library services for all citizens.",0
2002,"My comprehensive high school sex education course was one of the most valuable to me of all my subjects. My high school classmates and I were the guinea pigs for the pilot program at LSU's University Lab School in 1953. The course was quite comprehensive. It covered the mechanics, contraception, VD, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior. I don't recall the word abstinence being used. However, the teacher, J.Q. Long, emphasized that sex should be more than a physical act with potentially serious consequences, physical and psychological, and was not to be undertaken casually. Twenty-five years later I was amazed when some parents in my children's school in Michigan objected to the sex education courses which I'm pretty sure were less comprehensive than mine thirty years before in Louisiana.",0
2003,"The NY Times comments are the only ones I read anymore, so I would hate for it to be discontinued. I can imagine the work involved in moderating the comments; unfortunately, I don't see a way around it anymore to keep thought-provoking, and informative dialog going. It is sad, but it is also obvious that there are more than a few people who troll various sites for issues/people that bother them so they can unleash their self-righteous intolerance and name-calling. Ironically, it is usually these same people projecting their negative attributes to others. I enjoy the NYT comments section. Most of the comments seem well thought out and on-point, and the commenters are very knowledgeable. I frequently learn something new or see a point of view I hadn't considered.",0

When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor.

Moreover, the parent who won't let their child be vaccinated is a free rider. Other parents are accepting a minuscule -- but real risk -- of an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Their decision helps to protect the child of the free-riding parent because the vaccinated child serves as a sort of firebreak to slow the spread of the disease.",1

The reality is quite the opposite: money is far more authoritative than egalitarian, as those with the most money will always win in this situation. Everyone's greenbacks may be worth the same, but those with more greenbacks will be worth more. Therefore, the current system may be a pain, but it is far more egalitarian in its fairness than a system that allows those with the most money to go to the head of the line.",0

Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22.

2021,"I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression.

2022,"In 2013, the American Medical Association's 527-member House of Delegates revised the AMA's position, in place since 1977, that urged 'modification of state law to reduce the severity of penalties for possession of marijuana.' Of course, the US government blithely ignored this advice ever since it was given and went on to arrest over thirty million citizens for possession. The AMA delegates also endorsed a review of the 'risks and benefits' of new legal markets in Colorado and Washington. One of those 'benefits' is readily apparent - an average of 714 people per month were arrested in Colorado for possession in the first nine months of 2012. Arrest numbers have dropped over 80% in Colorado since legalization. Every person not arrested is a tragedy avoided. Many argue for a 'go slow' approach to legalization - exactly what we've seen for decades. The American Medical Association should speak forcefully of the health dangers of incarceration, the psychological damage of being arrested and incarcerated, and on behalf of the millions who would benefit from cannabis as medicine.",1
2023,"Christian churches long ago strayed from the gospel message of love and mercy and focused on certain sexual acts. Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control.

This is not rocket science - why do the hijab-wearers find it so difficult to understand? I have often seen immigrant women, possibly from Ghana, Nigeria, etc., go about in very colorful non-western dresses and I almost always admire them. And I believe most people admire these colorfully-dressed people even though they are obviously non-Caucasian immigrants from Africa. And the reason is simple: when we see these different-looking people, we do not immediately associate them with some sub-human brutes in other parts of the world.

If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians.

Bicycling will not reduce car use, but it will reduce mass transit use. Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another. The number of people (particular affluent people who are more likley to have cars, get deliveries such as Frsh Direct etc), the number of skyscrapers etc is the cause of car traffic in NYC.",1

We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate.

Defining the meaning of 'under the jurisdiction of the United States' to exclude those who entered the country illegally or are here on short term travel visas should only require a law saying as much. The courts could strike it down, I suppose, but it's far from clear that they should, and their decision would have to explain some interesting contradictions between their position and contradictory aspects of past immigration laws. I think that the current problem is due to a lack of clarity from Congress, not due to actual demands of the Constitution.",0

By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists.

Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they? Mr. Jaffe seems to think that we should have a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled. That is a dangerous road indeed.",1

I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses.

I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and 'there are all kinds of families' on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have 'a small family', because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the 'know what you're doing if you delay' advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college...",0

What this man doesn't realize is that he is saying that it's a sin to be born, making it a sin to live a life no matter what, which I find to be preposterous. It is simply an antiquated view that is taught in varying degrees by various religions and only serves to keep people divided by ignorance.

Robots are getting smarter and at some point will take over that job. At such point, they can be used to create the very walls I would worry about - hiding the truth from us again, but this time not because of a simple exclusive wall against free comment.

2093,"Convenience is opposed to quality. We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music. The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age. I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.",0

Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.",1

The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.",0
2099,"Not being from New York, maybe this discussion isn't meant for me, but I have to weigh in. I grew up in the country, on a farm, with a man for a father. He taught me to be like him: wake up early, work hard, eat a good meal, go to bed, repeat. He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them. He raised me to be better than him, because that is the mark of a good man: leaving things better than you found them. So, to me, if a man does all of these things, he's a manly man even when he's getting a manny peddy. (don't know if I spelled that right because I've never had one.)",1

A speck of a country the size of a county in most US states should not be the tail wagging the dog in Mideast policy. I want Israeli politics out of US foreign policy and I am not alone. I do not wish any ill upon the people or nation of Israel, but am tired of AIPAC undue influence in our foreign policy. There will be no lasting peace in the Israel until all parties see justice done. The Likudniks have no intention of brokering an honest and just peace with the Palestinian people nor respecting their rights of property.

What does make a difference is long-term accountability. Have pseudonyms tied to an email account that has to be verified periodically (e.g. once a year), and give pseudonyms a reputation score based on moderation (either by paid moderators as the Times does, or by other readers). Those with a high reputation score get perks like their comments being shown earlier, while those with a low reputation score get demoted to the bottom sections that almost nobody sees. That helps clear out the trolls or at least make them invisible.",1

In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life. Hands down.",1
2156,"Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, 'People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry' viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which 'has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the 'Least Restrictive Environment' concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted 'inclusion is illusion,' that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA.",0

It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright.

So they came here instead. Perhaps public universities in Utah and California are playing the same game, trying to attract out-of-state residents who will pay more tuition at the expense of admitting qualified in-state applicants. When two states play this game, the state with a lower cost of living wins. As California seeks to attract overseas and out-of-state talent, it should seriously consider where outside its borders it is driving its own in-state talent to go.",1

It's too early to confidently predict the course of the epidemic. In a couple of months, it may be a lot better, with public health officials finding good ways to protect travelers (and their communities back home who they might then infect).

We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them.

I would posit that a more informed patient is a better patient and the doctor's place is to evaluate the patient's understanding of the problem.

It is one of the rare websites where comments are allowed and no trash gets published. I rarely take part in or read the comment sections on other websites.

The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.",0

The fact that you don't see this is a prime example of how christian prejudice leads to an air of hate and danger for the LGBT community",1

Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it.

But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new 'compositions of matter'' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical.

Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones.

2235,"The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation.",0

A series of Turkish supporters of the islamofascist AKP party of Turkey who are paid by the Sultan (Erdogan) to discredit the Kurds and harness support for the now Islamic Republic of Turkey (the Sunni version of Iran). This is of course not a big deal in the Middle East and I wouldn't expect anything else from the major media outlets based in that region. However, little did I know that NYT would allow for these AKP trolls to be published on the platform of such a respected site. Whatever these trolls say, and whatever the mainstream media wants to spam people with, the truth will remain the same: 1. Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2. The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society. For this, Western powers should step away from the status quo that has brought nothing but civil war and what seems to be a perpetual low-grade conflict and instead support an independent Kurdistan.",1

Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong.

I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population.

Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy.

There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

In the face of 25% unemployment (50-60% among youth) populist help is a necessary part of anything to be done. What would you do, let them starve?

Circumcision practices for boys and girls are primitive and backward rituals intended to establish a clear distinction between them and societies they don't recognize or despise.

I witnessed a circumcision, I find it barbaric and cruel to a baby. I am a Jew and will not circumcise any boy. The only time it is acceptable would be for health or hygiene. Circumcision for girls is intended to be punitive and damaging , It is an abomination. Religious freedom stops when it starts to affect and interfere with the greater good of society.

Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems. When I worked as a benefits administrator for a large corporation on the East Coast I saw first-hand the cost of obesity to the obese employee and to the company. Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet. Obesity is not something to defend at all costs; obesity is something to help the obese person treat and become healthy.",1

Public schools still have to be built, maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools. Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money.

When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that '...much of the wealth enjoyed by' the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US.

I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the 'Arab Spring' by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that 'you reap what you sow'. There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots.

First, the universities could go from a two tiered; to a three tiered tuition model. Instead of in-state and out-of-state, it could be in-state, out-of-state and foreign. The foreign tuition could be almost as high as that of private universities, and it could allow public universities to benefit more from fewer foreign students. . The other thing they could do, is team up with Community Colleges to formalize what a lot of poorer students are already doing: which is to go to community college for two years and then transfer into a state school. They could pre-approve credit transfers; establish a separate approval process for students applying from the community colleges (to benefit poorer students), and even share lower level classes with the community colleges (allow community college students to take 100 level courses for example, for credit).",1

'Under current law, the growth of Medicare spending will be restrained in other ways during the next two decades, thus limiting the potential for the government to realize further savings from a premium support system.' And, '...spending for Medicare is projected to be restrained by provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will change the ways and amounts that health care pro- viders and insurers are paid.' Why go through such drastic changes to a system to save 6% 'as a Percentage of Net Federal Spending for Medicare'? Particularly when those 'savings' are costs picked up by the enrollee or pocketed in profits by private insurers or provider? Not that 6% (45b) is anything to laugh at, but surely a small uptick in my taxes would cover this?",1

If you want to sell the vast school market, the playing field will be level.

And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates.

The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers.

Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't.

I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever.

Also, some fees are designed to encourage unprofitable customers to walk out the door. And you guessed it.

The homework is tied to what they have done that day in math and I feel it reinforces the concept. I agree that children need time to play and relax but if they don't do any homework/extra academics outside of school hours, how are they going to be able to compete and excel at the college level? Kids can't suddenly be prepared for college when they are in 12th grade -- they need to start becoming academically disciplined in the elementary grades.

A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of 'criticism' is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any 'critic' stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few. Unlike the casual opinionators who crowd the Internet, the best professional critics become longtime companions - passionate, prickly friends with whom one can agree, laugh and argue over many shared experiences.",0

But the simple reality missing from the premise of this debate is having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information. A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained; > analyzed; then > utilized. How could this EVER become obsolete? Yes, it is demoralizing that too many students believe that Google relieves them of any obligation to actually acquire skills of investigation, evaluation, and synthesis or that experts like librarians are obsolete. However, when a graduate program's provides a list of companion articles for courses and then the library provides one-click access to each and every article, they both are complicit in contributing to their own obsolescence.",1

Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options.

2457,"Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news; they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review. Comments are essential for correcting these problems. Some blogs, like Prof Juan Cole usually contain thoughtful, informed and useful information. Others seem to call forth the the worst forms of trolls, bullys, idiots and haters. Proper monitoring, I believe can correct the abuses and allow a very important part of the internet to thrive.",0

Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

2468,"It would seem that Ms. Sun and parents that express a similar style or view of parenting ignore the primary goal of child raising that of having a reasonably happy child. The emphasis solely seems to be that of raising and exceptional child with varied skills and academic achievements presumably so that they are financially successful. As a teacher friend of mine once observed to me, exceptional children (students) comprise a very small percentage of any given class that he taught and that most students were average or a bit above average in their intellectual abilities and creative talents. A small percentage was below average. Is it any wonder we have raised generations of children who think that they are special, entitled and dependent on mood altering drugs. It is perfectly okay to be a plain ordinary good human being.

The Court has no ability to make any judgments that have any effect upon the election of Presidents nor of who is appointed to the Court.

If capital gains are untaxed, that means that the income tax system will become extremely regressive, with the wealthiest Americans paying virtually no taxes, and/or another tax, such as a national sales tax (also regressive) would have to be implemented. Since this scenario takes a lot of dollars out of the pockets of average people who spend their income, demand would take a huge hit. How would that impact growth and job creation?

2482,"I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: 'Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports.' I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that 'there is no going back.' How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.",0
2483,"College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate.",0

My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever. My own cats can go outside, and of course have their claws intact.",0

By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing.

Great focus on demand! So, we get help for the junkie, indeed. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear?

Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

There is nothing masculine or feminine about grooming your body hair or wanting to look good. If a unibrow is bothering a man and all it takes to fix it is a $20/20 minute trip to the salon, then whats the problem? I also don't appreciate how a lot of these things that are popular with gay men get labeled as feminine when applied to straight men. Perhaps in the past gay men have had more liberty to deviate from gender stereotypes and as a result straight men have felt more at ease to do the same.

Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip.

These students make the best employees. They take learning and work seriously. The problem is that graduates are now coming to the work force with far fewer skills and previous job experience than in previous generations. Many graduates have never held ANY job, be it baby sitting, dog walking or waitressing. I have found it preferable to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for more than a semester at a low wage with the understanding that due to their lack of experience, I will teach them, but they are more committed to stick around once they have learned and make great employees as their salaries go up with their abilities.",1

One can easily imagine some twenty- or thirty-something director, succored from birth on the slash-and-burn intensity of video games----and in the case of the very youngest in Hollywood, on MOVIES that have already been styled on such games-----working themselves into a frenzy on a computer, overdosing on special-effects software and whiz-bang CGI. One even imagines that it is the CGI that comes first------waking up in the middle of the night with an 'Oh, wow, that would be AWESOME!' kind of idea, they then build a movie around it only afterward. It is a new language, a new vernacular, of the filmmakers art. Whether anyone but the youngest speak this tongue is a moot point. As the saying goes, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.

2583,Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.,1
2584,"It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt a vocational view of the utility of language education. According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages.

2587,"Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own.",1

But the trope of reversing the intolerance argument is absurd, and I wish the right would stop using it. It reduces to 'you are being intolerant of our intolerance!' You cannot preach freedom, and the freedom to limit the freedom of others in the same breath. The Christian Right wishes to take away the freedom of gays to marry. This is not a private belief on their part, but an actual infringement of others' liberty. The right may counter, that I preach freedom, but wish to deprive people the right to legally own automatic weapons.

It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around. Scandinavia, almost all of Western Europe and Japan all have rapidly falling populations, which would be even worse if it were not for immigration.

The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes.",0
2624,"How can a person with the intelectual maturity of Ms. Bachman have been a candidate for president of the U.S.? It seems that most who wrote about this subject have only U.S. citizenship and therefore do not live and feel what dual, or multiple citizenship, is all about. Can you love your mother, your wife, your daugher without feeling unfaithful or a traitor? I have dual citizenship and I know how I feel about both countries: The one where my parents and family lived and struggled, the one of my culture, my music, its poets and writers, its cuisine, its beautiful topography and so much more, but also with some very negative things and the reason why I left. And now I have the one that welcome me, that gave me an oportunity for a better life, for safety and secutiy, for multidimendional growth. Can any one of you give me a good reason why I should swear off either one? And if this is what you are thinking, I'll take take of the wounded on either side.",1
2625,"Imagine if wearing seatbelts was controversial. Bike lanes are necessary for safety and the reason why one lane suddenly stops is because some community boards fight against bike lanes - especially in Brooklyn. They don't want to give up a car lane like on Prospect Park West, so they make up some crap about safety, as though there are hundreds of cyclists knocking people over. Most cyclists who use the protected lanes are polite and content that they feel safe and abide by the rules. It's the cyclists who don't use the lanes that are a problem - they ride too fast, arrogantly riding against traffic, don't look up. We all have to drive carfefully. Pedestrians need to stop texting as they cross the street. Everyone - pay attention!",0
2626,"Actually, it's a great idea, especially for law enforcement. Given that most illegal or undocumented people exists as electronic phantoms, with fake names or numbers, having a real set of ID, even if foreign derived, can be the loose thread needed to provide police with details on just who someone is. Police can then apply to the home country of a suspect to check for wants and warrants; if anything, it no longer allows the undocumented to hide in the shadow of anonymity as the government will now have access to a name, face, and fingerprint. It's an excellent idea.",1
2627,"Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension.",0

Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third.",1
2629,"no extreme parenting does not work. Balance is the key. Whatever style a parent engages in with his/her child, a balanced point of view is preferred. I believe the most important variable is to teach children that they can make decisions. When they are young they learn to make choices, albeit small choices, and as they get older the choices become more significant and important. i think the type of parenting described in the book is extreme and not the best path for parents to follow",1

I am unaware of any remaining, highly selective men's colleges, but choice should be preserved for women, especially if they can enroll in courses at nearby co-ed universities that are equally selective. Perhaps among the little Ivies, one or two should have remained all male. I went to a university that from the outset was to be co-ed (ok it took a few years while it raised money for a women's dorm). More than a few of my female contemporaries went on to excel in medical schools, law schools, and graduate school. I never noticed, however, any particular women's point of view in class; just excellence.",0

2635,"If the Democrats really believed that illegal squatters were an economic benefit to the country, they would have included them in the mandatory to all citizens, under penalty of a tax fine, Affordable Care Act. As it is the Democrats not only excluded illegal squatters from the Affordable Care Act, they excluded their children, citizens of the United States from those benefits. Those children born in the United States, are citizens according to Democrat idealogy, and yet they intentionally exempted them from benefits because the parents are here illegally. How can these children be covered when there parents are exempted? A simple case in point, these children will never be able to be on their parents insurance until age 26, as well as other benfits, because their illegal parents are not required to have insurance under the ACA. Democrats failed the smell test. Leaving baby citizens with no insurance. Or do the Democrats believe that these children are not citizens and are supposed to be intentionally deprived of healthcare, but not schooling?",1
2636,"As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student. If this is Educational theory, we are in deep trouble",1

I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet. I would have appreciated more time to make sure I understand what the results mean versus feeling like I got brushed off.

Why banks can default and get bailed out, and young people who are conned into signing big education loans are locked in with no recourse, says a lot about our current society.

Add in the $10s, possibly $100s of billions misplaced during the Iraq War, not to mention the expenditure we know about and it's really mind boggling. How did it come to this?

We actually prosecute people who do such things. Why should a person who risks a child's life under the guise of a 'Christian' belief be exempt?

The few extra bucks he picks up from one-time diners is going to be drowned by all the money he loses from regular patrons, who can't get the convenience and service they want. They'll go elsewhere, and he'll never see those one-time trend-surfers ever again. Buh-bye, Empellon. As for myself, I think all this is deeply silly. If I can't get a table at a restaurant at a decent time without having to wait on line, I go somewhere else. Lots of people can cook.

Firstly, the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along, largely made up of non-Syrians, imported into Syria for the sole purpose of regime change. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, most of the opposition is made up of ultra-religious jihadi groups, affiliated with al-Qaeda and others. It defies comprehension that anyone in the Western intelligentsia or media would advocate any of these groups over Assad or the government of Syria, or the Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups. What is the game plan here? Is it ISIS and/or jihadi control of Syria, governed b the invisible hand of Saudi Arabia, which is not known for its democratic tendencies?

Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere. I have long felt that Assad, and his father before him, were the only true impediment to peace in the middle east. Get rid of Assad, and I believe all the other pieces will fall into place.",0
