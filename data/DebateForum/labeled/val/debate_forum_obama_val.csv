"When people are disputing whether obama is a good president or not, when they are for him, their biggest argument is talking about how ""bad"" of a president George W. Bush was. That is besides the point. It seems to me that people have forgotten about Reagan and Lincoln (just to name a couple).",0
"Obama's birth certificate has been virtually ignored by a decent amount of people. It calls to mind a study that concerns people becoming more impassioned regarding a subject that they believe they are right in when presented with contradictory evidence. There's more context to the experiment but that is besides the point. It reflects an emotional state of politicking in America, rather than one based on logic.",1
"my vote goes to yes.   But i do think the President is in a pivotal time in his presidency, where he will be looked back in a Clinton esque view or as generally un productive President.  All though i do think the President began health care reforms to early on",1
Yes.  I just love the fact that there's somebody mixed race heading a racist country.  For that one reason I would vote for him.  If he does well for the country - good on him and maybe people will realise it.  If he turns America into a hell hole - good on him... I hate Americunts :),1
"The economy was already taking a nosedive when he stepped into office, and when he tried to pass his jobs bill to fix it, republicans vote it down and then proceeded to blame him for high unemployment. Strange how that works.  The Auto-industry was on the verge of collapse, when he came into office and now it's going strong. GM specifically was 17 months away from bankruptcy and now it's stocks are soaring and it has already paid back $11.8 billion to tax payers, 5 years ahead of schedule. Of the bank bailouts 66% of it has been paid back already. These averted bankruptcy and saved millions of jobs. Had we have let these industries go bankrupt, unemployment would have rocketed to levels not seen since the last great depression. Now add to that the fact that under His presidency Osama was killed, Gadaffi was killed, Egyptian President Mubarak was overthrown, and the Iraq war was ended. Considering all the problems we face I'd say he's doing pretty well.

Obama is a liberal black socialist and the media will not speak against him because they cater to the blacks.He wants this country to be a welfare state.The black vote will go his way because they would rather get things for free than to WORK!These people are a scourge on society and I wish they would quit reproducing their filth.I'm tired of paying to raise them!,0
"No. Where is all this ""change"" He's promised our country. Yes it takes time but in his entire time in office our country has NOT changed for the good of anyone really. Yeah Obama it is time for a change. Let's start by taking you out of office. One of the good things he did was his speech at the correspondents dinner in April when he shed comedy on the situation with his birth certificate. One of the only times a politian has truely made me laugh from wit and cleverness.",0

"That's more like it, recognizing that he's not such a Messiah after all. That's all I wanted.   Just to make you happy, I don't really like Obama that much, he's failed in a lot of aspects that I thought he'd do better, drones in Pakistan and others, hasn't pushed Republicans far enough to help the economy, and hasn't done shit to stop everything with Iran. I also remember watching a 2008 video of him speaking for ending the war on weed, yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard. I just don't like people calling him the devil, because he isn't.   Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.   Debt is created by a deficit. Less taxing means more debt.   And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Increased welfare spending was mandatory, it takes years to change the systems, and as far as I'm aware, it largely falls outside of his mandate (state law, not federal, I'd assume?).   If the bad lot doesn't include Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, both for completely ending the turmoil in the Middle East, you'd be right.   As I've said before, I like this part of them, but disagree with others. If I could mix and match, I could find most of my views in US politicians, I just can't find anyone who has all of them in one.

False   Whilst I agree that there was a large extent of government failure after deregulation, were there not deregulation in the first place, there would not have been the opportunity for CBO's, the abuse of the housing market, and the reckless behaviour that you described. You wish to completely deregulate the banks? This seems unwise, bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country. Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common, with people not being held responsible for their actions.   Based on the assertions of Catholic Bishops?   I was simply using them as an example. I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.",1

Almost 90% of economist and business people a like say that OBama's policies and lack of business know how is what's making things worse. Good luck on NOv 2nd your going to need it. Obama is not the change Americans hoped for he campaigned in the middle and ran on the left. He's a socialist a Anti colonialist. That's how his dad taught him that's why he returned Winston Churchill's bust back to England his dad despised the Brits for colonizing impoverished nations.

"""Just because he cannot pass any new laws does not mean he cannot enforce the ones that are already on the book.""  Must of these laws that you want him to enforce are bull shit. When he tries to make laws that will be better, the Republicans block any sort of progress.  ""He did, that's why it is on my list of ways Obama = Bush.""  Let me restate that in actuality Bush's response was worse then Obama's, Bush was told by the Govenor of Louisana as well as the Mayor of New Orleans that the leevees would not hold prior to Katrina but did nothing, it hit New Orleans on Monday and Bush overflew the devastated area on Air Force One as he traveled from Texas back to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and wasn't briefed about the situation until he arrived at the Gulf Coast on Friday. Thats a week of doing nothing even though he had already been told prior to Katrina that the leevees would not hold.  The oil spill that is occuring right now however was not predicted and Obama was told by BP that it was not a serious problem and wasn't told that the leak was in fact serious until almost a week later.  Bottom Line: Obama didn't know, Bush didn't even care.  ""Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him.""  The recession started around December of 2007 so Bush's bail outs didn't do shit. As for the Democrats blocking Bush from Fanny and Freddie, the Republicans are doing the same thing now with Wall Street.",1

He didn't address global warming.  He didn't commit enough to Afghanistan.  He didn't address the rising income inequality in America.  He didn't address health care costs.

Saving the car company prevented many from being unemployed and also prevented a strain on the government providing unemployment benefits to recipients. We need taxpayers money to help maintain the economy of this country. The war in Iraq is not over but atleast the president is making an effort to tend to it.

If other people can do it, then they should have run for office as well.  Really? Anyone could appoint Supreme Court Justices?

"Uh...The ""Bush"" bailout of the banks was done at the request of then president-elect Obama.   That's not even what the article reports. The article pertains to a potential (at the time) Obama request for additional funds not already released in the Bailout process (that was allocated in the Bailout). The Bailout had already been put into action and wasn't done at the request of Obama. You're interpretation is wrong.   The GM was paid back?!   Yes. GM ultimately used their loaned money to repay their loan. Get the fuck over it. The next time you take out a loan and realize you don't have to use all of it, make sure to never - ever - use any of the residual to help pay back your loan. There's something wrong with that, according to you.   The taxpayer isn't getting jack shit paid back.   My assertion was that taxpayer money was returned, not that it was being returned to the taxpayer. We let go of that money. It's not ""ours"" anymore, it's money that is to be used by the government.   The only thing we'll be getting is inflation, higher taxes, and raised insurance premiums thanks to healthcare ""deform.""   Okay.",1
There is a difference between name calling and fact. Those are facts.,0
"Well, at least you aren't arguing with a tin foil hat like most opponents, but I still think you're wrong.  1 + 2. Blah, I moved a decimal, you're right. I feel that they cost just as much is as solid a point as the wars costing more, either way it's more wasteful imo.  Plus, again, we won't know for a few years, but every country that has done something similar actually pays less for healthcare, than the US  link  - scroll down to see a chart, you'll be amazed. I think there is something lost in our translation following the money trail, much of that cost isn't an increase, it's a shift into where the money is coming from and how it is tracked. ie, today when one without insurance goes to the emergency room it is not a cost but a debt. A large part of the 1-1.5 trillion  cost  represents that shift. We're paying for emergency room visits now anyway in other words, we just don't count it. Either way we're indebted to China, but that's another issue entirely and I don't believe this will effect that long term one way or another.  3. As a matter of fact, I think a Medicare for all system would be the most cost-effective route. As for incentive to stay in business,  link  - they'll still be the second richest people in the land next to banks even with new regulations.  4. Well, the problem with claiming that it is somehow illegal to mandate purchasing healthcare is that you can use the same logic that you use for ""everyone wants a clean hospital."" In that ""everyone wants to go to the doctor when they are sick."" Again, the problem is a lack of imagination on the part of the healthy I think. The fact is, just as many people, when sick, want insurance as want a clean hospital I would argue. If approached as a mandate for private consumption, as in say ""it is the law of the land you buy candy"" sure, unconstitutional as hell. However, they will take the taxation approach I believe. Like roads, doctors and hospitals are a a privilege afforded all citizens, as such, like roads, paid for by all citizens.  5. Yes, it should be health insurance reform.

For standing up for gay rights and leading the fight against the discriminatory ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents patriotic Americans from serving their country for something as silly as sexual preference, I will vote for him again.  For negotiating the START treaty and seeing it passed in a bipartisan way, I will vote for him again.  And for the times when his heart was in the right place and he tried to do but could not thanks to Republican and Blue Dog opposition in Congress (a public option, reducing the deficit by not granting tax cuts to the richest Americans, the DREAM act), I will vote for him again.

So let's talk about the ideology of saving the auto industry. Or even better, simplify: Added to the Corporatist system of the United States. Same with bailing out the banks. And for shame... I thought you didn't like the corporations and all their money. Finally, they have a chance to fail and leave their business to bidders, and you support the legislation that keeps them ""too big to fail"".   ""Finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system"".  Ridiculous indeed. We waste billions on medicare and medicaid, just to see that they are, in general, pathetic ways to help those in need. I don't disagree with you on that one. My problem is 1. Brave... like all the other presidents who were ""finally brave enough"" to do something about the healthcare system? INCLUDING BUSH! 2. Government hospitals and Universal Health-care... right, because government healthcare worked in this country all this time... oh wait, our health care system is ridiculous. Darn these intricate fallacies. BUT WAIT!!!! A voucher program, proposed by Paul Ryan, implying that government will continue to help people who are in need of medical care but can't afford it, but instead of choosing what kind of treatment the people will receive, they will be able to choose their coverage in the private sector. This is far better than subsidizing for subsidizing takes away incentive to compete and provide better coverage. But with the voucher program, the private sector will continue to compete for the only way for them to receive that money is if the people find them a suitable insurer. But that's too sensible, right? Nope, let's just get government more involved with running the healthcare system, because if cotton rips all the time, the only solution is MOAR cotton.  But another thing we can agree on, the Republican nominees are looking shitty. Gary Johnson and Ron Paul will most likely not get it, and Paul Ryan is dicking around.",0

"Explain to me why it is obvious.    It was obvious because 1) That's the way the term is most often used in US political discussions 2) Conservatives have made it clear that they will object to anything and everything Obama does or attempts to do. It therefore follows that they will call his policies disastrous regardless of reality. 3) Conservatives are obviously not always entirely irrational. The italics hinted that I was half-joking, that I was taking a dig at the opposition.   If you would have used the term ‘conservative’ I would have supposed you were referencing republicans exclusively. Yet, the term you used is ‘conservative ideologues’. And while you may argue that republicans are conservative ideologues I would also argue that republicans are not the only conservative ideologues. For I personally know many democrats who are conservative ideologues.    I could submit thirty failed predictions of thirty economists of the past ten years.    This statements reflects a lack of understanding of the fallability of anecdotal evidence. You can't just go outside and pick out thirty white stones and thereby assert that all stones are white. However, a random sampling of essays in a major economics journal might do the trick.   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  The following is an  illustration  of the very reason why I asked you to qualify what you call extraordinary evidence:  You affirm that there are no stones that are white. I affirm that there are stones that are white. You assert that my assertion is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. I in turn request the number of stones that you require as evidence that there are stones that are white. And you reply that my evidence is anecdotal if I present the evidence of white stones.  Remember, I am seeking to satisfy your request to provide the necessary evidence that brings into question the prudence of relying upon the consensus opinion of mainstream economists. I am not attempting to prove that the consensus opinion of mainstream economists is true or false in the future. You must realize that I am attempting to demonstrate the fact that when a group of individuals has consistently misled our expectations we must realize that we have been misguided. And unless we want to be misguided in the future I recommend that we consider the track record of those who guide our expectations. Not that they may be right or wrong in the future, its just a matter of whether or not we are willing to follow the same course.   I’ll address your other statements after we settle this latest disconnect.   (You have assumed that I am attempting to draw an invalid inference.)",0

Just like the cash for clunkers it was good when it lasted but automakers saw numbers jump 20% but now it's over there sales are back down 20%. It's not real job creation.

"He will go down as probably one of the top 5 worst presidents that we have ever had. I believe he is a traitor.   First of all he is hiding who he says he is. Took way to long to present his birth certificate…if that is the real we probably will never know. Never would present his academic records from the colleges he supposedly attended. Would not release his medical records either. Who is he?  Well he has bowed down and kissed Arab leaders. He has treated the president of Israel terrible…what leader in the world comes to the White House and has to use the back door?   His hero is an anti-American racist who hates whites….Rev. Wright. He was in bed with Tony Rezko the Chicgo slug who is now in prison. I mean what political candidate would take money from someone who is being investigated by the FBI? OBAMA.  Then there is his affiliation to communist radicals…many of whom he appointed as Czars in his administration. Enter the scene….Bernadine Dohrn and her communist husband Bill Ayers who founded the organization Weather Underground.    ""The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [Black] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement."" And that is what she and her husband did.  For a long time she was on the FBI's most wanted list. Her husband is just as radical as she was. Two of Obamas friends.  He failed to handle the Gulf Oil spill in a timely manner.  Failed to end the war like he promised he would do. Took him three years to end it….hundreds more died on his watch.  Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it came to a vote.  Snubbed the president of Israel. Snubbed Britain by returning that bust of Churchill.    He appointed Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions (without even getting congressional approval) then doing nothing for them after Glenn Beck calls them out…forcing many to resign.  Then there was his failed stimulus…health care the country still does not want…  Wants total amnesty for illegals.  Does not even know basic American geography and thinks there are 57 states.  Thinks that there was only one bomb that hit Pearl Harbor.  He thinks to solve any financial crisis….borrowing is the answer. So he has borrowed until we now don't even have our chins above water.  I could go on and on….  He is a narcissist and his change was not what the people who even voted for him expected he meant. His change seeks to destroy the country. He is absolutely incompetent and dangerous….and I would vote for just about anyone in order to get him out. Well except Nancy Pelosi and I think she is almost worse than Obama is.   If he is get in for four more years…we are doomed. He hates this country and it shows. He has done nothing but apologize for Americas actions since taking office and I think people even many Democrats are sick of him and can now see him for what he is.   Change is good in some cases….thats why we need to throw him out. Maybe then he can go over and listen to the Muslim call to prayer…something he said was the most beautiiful thing he has ever heard.

"No signing statements to nullify or undermine congressional instructions as enacted into law    Here is Obama's full memo:   Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies     SUBJECT: Presidential Signing Statements     For nearly two centuries, Presidents have issued statements addressing constitutional or other legal questions upon signing bills into law (signing statements). Particularly since omnibus bills have become prevalent, signing statements have often been used to ensure that concerns about the constitutionality of discrete statutory provisions do not require a veto of the entire bill.     In recent years, there has been considerable public discussion and criticism of the use of signing statements to raise constitutional objections to statutory provisions. There is no doubt that the practice of issuing such statements can be abused. Constitutional signing statements should not be used to suggest that the President will disregard statutory requirements on the basis of policy disagreements. At the same time, such signing statements serve a legitimate function in our system, at least when based on well-founded constitutional objections. In appropriately limited circumstances, they represent an exercise of the President's constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and they promote a healthy dialogue between the executive branch and the Congress.     With these considerations in mind and based upon advice of the Department of Justice, I will issue signing statements to address constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means of discharging my constitutional responsibilities. In issuing signing statements, I shall adhere to the following principles:   1.The executive branch will take appropriate and timely steps, whenever practicable, to inform the Congress of its constitutional concerns about pending legislation. Such communication should facilitate the efforts of the executive branch and the Congress to work together to address these concerns during the legislative process, thus minimizing the number of occasions on which I am presented with an enrolled bill that may require a signing statement.   2.Because legislation enacted by the Congress comes with a presumption of constitutionality, I will strive to avoid the conclusion that any part of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional. In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional, I will act with caution and restraint, based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well-founded.   3.To promote transparency and accountability, I will ensure that signing statements identify my constitutional concerns about a statutory provision with sufficient specificity to make clear the nature and basis of the constitutional objection.   4.I will announce in signing statements that I will construe a statutory provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that construction is a legitimate one.  To ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed only when consistent with these principles, executive branch departments and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the Attorney General before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to comply with, any provision of a statute.  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

The most logical thing for anyone is to drop their policy or if uninsured, remain uninsured, and pay $750/year penalties until you finally get sick, then anyone can buy health insurance since there are no pre-existing conditions.

"1. Well, he's trying. We now have ended military involvement in Iraq like he said, he passed healthcare like he said, we've ramped up involvement in Afghanistan like he said, and the economy has improved somewhat - not as fast as anyone would like, but it has improved.  2. Yeah you did, you said if McCain was black and young he'd be in office. This means being black would be one of the prerequisites. I explained why it was not. And as Fox mentions every 10 minutes more people watch fox, and fox has done nothing but demonize Obama from day 1 so by right media's own admission the idea of media choosing the president is logically impossible.  3. same as above. And both the Clinton elections and the Obama election had hundreds of thousands more voters than any Republican election in decades. The numbers say I'm correct.  4. It's my experience that those who ""disagree with his politics"" like prayerfails below is lost in a sea of right wing blogs and fox and actually have no idea what Obama's politics really are. You're going to have to prove a specific issue in some debate in order for me to buy this argument.",1

"President Obama, sense the time of his election has fallen drastically in my opinion... he has shown himself to be arrogant, far from anything close to By Partisan (with the exception of pushing for the bush tax cuts... which is commendable) , his foreign and domestic policy's have been either against the will of the people or for big controlling (intrusive) government... and now he's looking to give amnesty to illegal immigrants... i.e. rewarding criminals (dream act)!!!???... so for the aforesaid reasons, and others that have not been stated, Barack Hussein Obama is close to worst president in my book.",0
We should give him another opportunity. I saw that he tried to work his best. No reason we don't give him another opportunity ... I think that.,1

"Yawn.  "" There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me — because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t — look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. (Applause.)  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.  The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.  So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the GI Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for President — because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together. ""  If you've got it in your head that it's possible to be prosperous in America independent of public help, then you're deluded, and I've got no time for indulging delusional people.

President Obama's love affair with Keynesian Economics makes me want to vomit.,0
"Bush did the bailouts wrong. He didn't include lending requirements for the banks. Obama did better.  Kicking out lobbyists is  a fact . I seriously doubt Obama gave stimulus money to ACORN.  So the solution to terrorism is to act like terrorists ourselves? We can to better. Torture is dishonorable and causes us to lose legitimacy. Besides, it doesn't work.  Bush allowed for research on products derived from the cells already in existence, not for the creation of new lines.  Heh, this is kind of a stupid debate, isn't it?",1
"Wilson was pretty bad, and so was Buchanan. Carter gives Obama a good run for his money (or should I say other people's money) but I have to say Obama is without a doubt the worst, most spendthrift, most disengaged, incompetent and inept President I've ever seen. An outstanding stump politician, but completely devoid of leadership skills.",0

As for Georgia, I would need a lot more information before jumping to any conclusions. It seems like there should be a way for the UN to take action even if one country doesn't want to. Also, since you didn't cite a source I'm going to presume the quote is out of context and misleading. It seems ridiculous for you to be picking some tiny, obscure statement made a long time ago and using it to make Obama seem dumb. If that's the best you've got it just shows how rarely he says dumb things.",1

"Answer these questions.  How is government funded? Does government possess any assets without taxation? Does government have any financial authority without taxation?   Technically speaking our government owns nothing because it is public, however practically speaking it owns its institutions and their collective works.  Does a business have any financial authority without charging a bill? In other words, speaking in the context of our discussion, taxation and a private bill are practically the same.   Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.   It doesn't matter if a business generates income by itself, it matters if it generates it by exchange with others.   There is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the private sector by law.   Does not change the fact that they are not transferred jobs, but created ones.   Again, you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services. The private sector is may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as NASA or USPS.   Only the wealthiest oil corporations could hope to touch our military budget, and yet they fall short by about half. That is to say nothing of medical research, aerospace research and engineering, and physics research like the LHC which are all in addition to the military budget.   All of the employees who work at NASA or Defense, whose money is it that they are using. Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money can from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   They use their own money, which comes from providing a service to the public (taxes), through trade of goods (technology to the private sector and other governments).   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.   It really isn't that simple, because a portion of that 40% is often made accessible to the people in the form of student aid, welfare, unemployment, social security, schools, medicine, etc. The other 60% as utilised by the private sector is never distributed in a manner approaching equality and that is why you have one percent of the people holding fourty percent of it (which would mean as per your numbers that 1% of the people hold 16% of the nation's economy in their hands).  To answer your actual question however, what I mean by surplus wealth is that wealth which is beyond the living means of the owner.   For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. So, now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   It's the same exact issue with private companies. If you have 100 dollars, and this is the total GDP, and a business charges you 5$ for medicine, you now have 95$ and the business has 5$. The business did not increase the GDP to 105$. Conservation of wealth, like conservation of energy.   Milton  Milton   I never cared for Milton Friedman's opinion. He's a bit of a nutter.   This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   Keynesian economics is merely the idea that government can intervene to stimulate the market where it is acting with reduced efficiency.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.   You just explained how a government uses tax, and the behaviours surrounding government borrowing. What I'm interested in is the fundamental changing of hands which both sales and taxes employ.   And that money is who money does it belong to.   It would be the government's money, since they provided a service and you are paying for it.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Same thing.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.   The healthcare act is not socialised medicine. It is private medicine, which means that the ""rationed care"" you speak of is a capitalist phenomenon.   Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many. REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.  Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   It is a matter of the ""welfare of the few, for the many"" because right now those bad ethics are wildly illegal. If they were not, it wouldn't be the few any longer but a large number of annual deaths and deformities caused by standard medical research practice.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   Most of them you hardly notice: roads, research, technological development, military, police, courts. Also: government put a man on the moon and a probe on mars. What has big business done for you?   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   I don't.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   Just wait until you get fired or laid off from your career at age fifty, and are desperate to find work for almost a year but no one hires you because you're old and they want new, young professionals. You really have no empathy for these people because you're too self-absorbed.  One other detail: since many thousands of them would be laid off, this means that the market would be suddenly flooded with people who have the same credentials, which means they would probably receive lower salaries on top of losing their retirement.   I am certain that one man, Branson, will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks. Maybe, space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it.   I'm not as hopeful, look at airline security and how often a plane crashes. I can just imagine the skies being littered with thousands of bodies due to cost-cutting and terrorists.",1
