If he does make the offer to fully support the child without the mother being around, good for him, but he still can't force her to carry and birth it.",0,1
1,"You are incorrect in stating, ""if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide."" You would only be charged with two counts of homicide if the prosecution can prove the baby could have survived outside of the womb. If a doctor were to provide an abortion after 24 weeks, he or she would also be charged with homicide (unless the baby would not have been viable or was a threat to the health of the mother).",0,1
2,"Abortion is dumb, all the woman who have any are STUPID!!!! Abortion could ruin the race of mankind!! Then we would all be dead!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  I do NOT like the idea of abortion and obama is stupid to give federal funds to abortion!!!!",0,2
3,"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.   Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.   Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.   Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.   Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.   My own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion!!",0,2
4,What I don't get is people pay to kill their OWN children. They are paying to murder an innosent child. Those people are murderers!! They are killers!! And if they have an abortion more than once it is like they are serial killers!!,0,2
5,"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13.   Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods. You should help everyone stay healthy and alive.   I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted.",0,2
6,"There is a VERY simple answer to the abortion debate:  Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control. It should ONLY be allowed (as a final solution) in the event of a pregnancy resulting from rape, incest, or other sexual crime.",0,2
7,"No, no, no, NO! Abortion should NOT be just another form of birth control. It should ONLY be allowed for victims of rape and sexual abuse that results in pregnancy, and ONLY as a last resort.",0,2
8,"It makes me sick to think that there are people as thick-skulled as you. Living in your ideal little world with lolli-pop forests and marshmallow skies.  Have you ever heard of RAPE, or INCEST? Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control, but for a victim of sexual abuse of any kind, it should at least be a final option.",0,1
9,"YES! EXACTLY! THANK YOU!  Victims of sexual crimes which result in unwanted pregnancy should be afforded the option to abort, but only as a FINAL solution.  And the only other exception would be when birth endangers the life of the mother, but of course, THAT decision would be left to the woman whose life is in danger.  Abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.  My thoughts exactly. Thank you!",0,1
10,"A fetus is not a parasite. Its an undeveloped human. No skin cells, hair follicles or any other bunch of cells. A undeveloped human. A woman has eggs for reproduction. These eggs have to be fertilized to create a fetus. If left unchecked as long as the fetus is healthy a human being will be formed inside the womans womb. If a woman doesnt want a child its her responsibility to prevent it from getting started. Women have plenty of ways to prevent unwanted prgnancy. Killing a fetus is wrong. Its a very young human. You can argue details but bottom line is it will one day, if all goes well,become a functioning member of the human race. Terminating this is murder. The question we need to ask is why do we have this problem in our ""advanced"" civilization. Most abortions are from unwanted pregnancy not rapes or medical conditions. Are women not ready for their rights? Mass murder of undeveloped humans because of irresponsibilty. We shouldn't condone this behavior as a womans right. WE should condemn because its a womans responsibility to be a mother when she decides to create a fetus.",0,2
11,Happy to have an option to kill an innocent baby. Enough said about the women the women you know. HAPPY???????????,0,2
12,"abortion should be banned. abortion is like killing a baby. would you do that? if you would then go ahead and abort, but it is still wrong and should be banned.....",0,2
13,but its also wrong to kill a child that doesn`t want to be killed...,0,1
14,..............someday you will regret the last thing you wrote.....,0,2
15,"Absolutely! Except for cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at stake.",0,2
16,"Give me a few more years and I suspect I'll be 99% pro-life as my opinion continues to evolve the older I get. At this point I believe it should be rare... only in the first trimester and only once... not to be used as a form of birth control. As for rape and incest, I don't know if I will ever believe that abortion shouldn't be allowed in those cases.",0,1
17,I think that stupid teenagers and even older women who decided to have sex when they KNEW they couldn't afford a baby should be restricted from it unless there is a medical problem with the mother.,0,2
18,"It shouldn't be banned, but restricted to ONLY the women who really need it for something like Medical purposes.",0,1
19,"That's funny: she was so keen on 'evicting' when she had someone's dick up inside her C:  Arguments that say ""Cause and Effect don't matter if you don't like it"" are also ludicrous. The very purpose of sex IS to have children. That is fact.  I love how people like using things with no regard for the CONSEQUENCES and as soon as they are faced with the consequences they decide to take the easy way out. It's the same thing with people who abuse alcohol.  You get drunk: The result is a hangover.  That's science.  You CHOSE to get drunk.  You also CHOOSE to risk the hangover.  If you can't handle consequences, then don't act on the cause!",0,2
20,"Actually: I came up with my opinions of Abortion without the help of religion. I researched the topic independently, and tried to learn every angle that I could from BOTH sides. I'm pro-life in the definition of I think that every person should have equal opportunity to live, and that people should give the life as much chance to live as possible.  I think abortions that are NOT based on betterment for the woman or baby's health is wrong.   Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?  I care about all people in general having the chance to life their life to the fullest.  Not what people in the Bible said about it.  And abortion only prevents a child from being a 'bother' to their parents (unless it's for medical reasons). The parents decided to have sex knowing FULL WELL that they had the risk of having a child. But once they are met with the result of sex they want to bail out because they don't want to be inconvenienced with something THEY MADE.  If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions.",0,2
21,"1) And yet, half the people here were talking about how it's the woman's choice ONLY. The argument people ALWAYS make are that it's ""the woman's body.""  Interesting.  2) I actually can't agree with this. Rape is more iffy of course, but I don't think the child should have revenge taken out on them for being raped. The father who raped the women should suffer: not the child.  I somewhat understand that point, but I don't think it makes anything right.  I also think incest isn't much of a reason (Unless you're talking about the pedophillia related incest...) unless the women is AGAIN needing it for medical reasons. But consensual incest shouldn't equal death.  I don't condone incest, but it's a lesser evil to other things.  3) I can understand it if the baby has a deformity that WILL actually hurt them in the future.   5) the others; not much to argue I guess.",0,2
22,"They can have sex, but they must be prepared to deal with the result of it. Since when was sex the only thing that kept together a marriage? The purpose of marriage is to start a family, which includes supporting each other in BOTH good times and BAD. If you aren't trying to start a family then GTFO :)  A childless couple isn't acting irresponsibly if they are prepared to take responsibility if they have sex.",0,2
23,Abortion in general is wrong in the sense of life being erased. It may be less so if it's for a valid reason like health. But I think that abortions made for more reasons than that is the result of selfishness usually...,0,2
24,"Abortion:  When life becomes subjective, and a killing an option.   Since when is it acceptable for people say that because it's not 'quite human' we can just do whatever the heck we want with it?  The logic of something needing to PROVE that it has a right to live is just sick. Why is it that we get to define when it's okay to exterminate something?  Why is it okay to kill an unborn child, period? It might be understandable in some situations, but it doesn't make the choice RIGHT.  I LOVE how a person can go to jail for killing their household pets, but then it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child because it hasn't met someone's standards of ""It deserves to livee~""  I can support a person's decision on the matter when it is completely necessary, but all the people who think abortion is all right and good is just sick :/",0,2
25,"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.  Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?  If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.  You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned",0,2
26,"Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it. The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.  I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.  But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death. With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost.",0,2
27,"I say they should, but it depends. If the woman got raped or a mother could die, I could see some instances where they should not be banned. But basically everything else to me should be banned. So, due to majority, I will say it should be banned :). The term abstinence has apparently become extinct these days...",0,2
28,Why should the woman carry out the child for a crime in which she was a victim and for a child she did not want to have? It could go both ways. Leave it up to the woman to decide.,0,2
29,"You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will. Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God. No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world. It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity. You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin. You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible. I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type. Like I said earlier, leave the judging to God.",0,2
30,"No, you are way out in left field. Stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic. What does Hitler have to do with abortions? As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself. Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right? What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?  You stand by and watch people kill each other during war. What kind of love is this? Yes, you can do something concerning abortions. Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this. That is the main point of my argument. I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.  What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'? Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion. Apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin. Also, I need to know what your definition of judging is, since you disagree with mine.",0,2
31,"Hitler was a murderer for having abortions? Like I said, keep it to the topic.   Hmm, lets see...You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with ""go check the Bible."" I'm still waiting for the evidence. I ask two simple questions. What did Jesus say about abortions? What is right and wrong according to Jesus? I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me.  We are all lawbreakers. So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other? God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS. A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies. Why are you trying to deny it? You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS. ""Go get your Bible"" if you think I am wrong.   I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic. We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion. I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with. I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason. The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion. Obviously it is a human being imo. Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic. Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?",0,2
32,"infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence  -----  I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument. Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.  ----  I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly.   -----  Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.  -----  I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.  -----  I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings.   -----   How very judgmental of you.   You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.  -----   Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.   Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...  -----   note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.   Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.  -----  Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so.     Romans 10:9,10  ""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""  Ephesians 2:8,9:  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works , so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do""  I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments. Paul touches on this in his letters. I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to.",0,2
33,"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  ""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.",0,1

Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary. This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them.",0,1

We have all heard about how traumatizing foster care can be for a lot of children who end up having a lot of mental issues and distress when they are older. Yeah you may be keeping a child a live but when you think about what they have to go through as children in the system is it really worth it? And not to mention if they do get adopted young and find out when they are older it is going to be extremely hard for them. When people get abortions the baby cant process it or know!! What is the baby going to miss or know if they are never born nothing. Its not like they are going to be born to another family and say oh yeah i had a mother once but she got rid of me before i was born.,0,1
73,"Though i don't think i would be able to get an abortion because i hate big medical procedures i don't see why other people shouldn't or can't. There is not a limit on how many children a women can have, meaning if a women gets an abortion that is not one less child she can have on the future. Most only want 2 or 3 she can still have those 2 or 3 children. At the stage of pregnancy when abortions happen the baby obviously wouldnt be able to live if it was taken out of the womb that early, so is it really considered alive in the womb even if it has a heartbeat. It isn't until the 6th or 7th month that baby might have a chance of surviving if it is taken out early. People say that if it was a mistake you should have been more careful and should deal with it. But if there is a way to fix it it why is it bad? Abortion is in no way an easy route there are consequences and it is punishment enough for a mistake. And if the baby was formed without the mothers consent she whould be able to get rid of it as to not be reminded of the forced father.",0,1
74,"Well, the question is what makes us a person, and what makes us special above those beings which are okay to kill (most animals, insects plants etc...). I would argue that it's our ability to think and feel at a higher level.   An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people and therefore must be put into a separate category then a fully formed person.  Considering your ignorance on the topic of biology that you demonstrated in the evolution debate, I would not be surprised if you were unaware of this, but if you don't believe me I would be happy to provide evidence (or you could save me the trouble and trust me).  The question then becomes: at what point does the unborn embryo/fetus gain the rights of a full grown person? There are two extremes:  1) The moment after conception.  2) The moment of birth.  My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops. How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current ""all or nothing"" one that is all too common.",0,1
75,"Allow me to explain: I do believe that at a certain point in the pregnancy, abortion should not be legal. Where this point is, is what we should be debating.

In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.",0,1
77,"Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it. The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers. Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate. I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like  Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged  it makes it really difficult to continue.  Of course no one wants to get an abortion. Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something. What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes. Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions). I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.  I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother. We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.

But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.

81,"I think that referring to mathematical rules as ""laws"" is the kind of misleading argument religious people like to use when implying that when using mathematics you require faith.

We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.  Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life. My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us. This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.  Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one...   ""1 is not 4""   Wrong, this is not always the case. When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4. In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system).",0,1

It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.  If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption? In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year. Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become ""baby merchants"", for profit. An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs. What moral ground does that hold? Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty.   To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.  I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance.

104,"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.  Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.  Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.    Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.  Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. WORDS: 981",0,2

107,"This is a speech that i found:  On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.  Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.  Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.  The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.  Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.  The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.  In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.",0,1
108,"Abortion should not be banned. I've yet to come across a reason that is not somehow tied with religion.   If you believe abortion is wrong don't have one, but don't push your beliefs on someone else who feels differently because of your own self-righteousness.",0,1
109,"There is a reason why they sides are called Pro-life vs Pro-Choice. Very few (if any) are for abortion, I happen to be one of them, however, I am for a woman's right to chose. The only argument that Pro-life people have to take away the right of other is based off of their own self-righteousness.",0,1
110,"Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage.   Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse. It takes TWO people to make sex. So,  you  not having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well.   It would require both parties abstain to attain the ""high sexual standards"" you propose setting. What are our current sexual standards by comparison?   As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins. As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement.",0,1
111,"My point is you're forced to rely on your spouse having been a virgin prior to marriage as well. And you'll really only ever be 100% sure of your own sexual history. So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence. For life.   There is certainly question to when life begins. You say it's life throughout. What marks the beginning stage then? The question is  not  what kind of life. What does that even mean?   And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor. Nice try. Your neighbor  is  a fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months. Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children.   I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work.",0,1
112,"It is a degradation to you, perhaps. Others believe differently. Why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs? Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc. They  are  going to act on it. Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them?   Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example. A baby grows inside of you. So technically, it is a part of you. A part of your body. You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to. This is why a ban on abortion would fail.   We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to. No woman comes to it lightly. When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness. Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term. Others because they know they cannot financially support the child. Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to. Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make. So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference.   As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim?    From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education:     Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people. The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs  can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk  of HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programs  do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity  or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents.  By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.   The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or “abstinence- plus”) sex education is the proven effective choice. Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated.",0,1
113,"Ah, now we get to the core of your argument. Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making? So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies? Gay sex is wrong, then? Or sex between infertile married couples? Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality. Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others.   Your statement that ""sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties"" is laughable. Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships. Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong. What effect am I numb to? Orgasm? Hardly.   ""It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting""--like a parasite? So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months.   Stop trying to relate my examples to murder. You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person.   You claim that adoption is the ""only ethical choice"" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion. 1-Addicts  cannot  bring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption. It also assumes that there would be enough of a ""market"" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned. Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise?   Prohibition never works. Prohibition on alcohol didn't work. Prohibition on marijuana is not working. Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work. Prohibition fails. Period.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex"". We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible. I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it.   Did you bother reading the study I linked to? I'll reiterate the key points of their findings.  1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity.    So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them. Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative. If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it? To appease your moral beliefs? Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals. They are about people. And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it. Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love.   I suggest this. Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex. But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex. Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them. Wouldn't you rather they fall without HIV? Or an unwanted pregnancy?",0,1
114,"So what then, is the ""the purpose for which it was designed"" if not procreation? Pleasure?! Say it's not so!   I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed. And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education. Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature. (And those impulses and desires are not wrong.) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality. I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with. So long as it is consensual, there's no justification. We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber. Do we talk about the morality of football? The morality of swimming? The morality of sleeping?   Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others. Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards. How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal?   LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage. How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though? If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of? As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals. Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle. Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual. That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong.   Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you? It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made. It's an effect. Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex. Not a choice in and of itself. The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception. But sometimes it comes after. Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice.   The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible. I agree that it should not be used as birth control. I agree that we ought to reduce the number. I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that. You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best. It's just...jaded. There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year. I'm not sure how many adoptive couples. My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today?   Again, let me specify. When I say ""prohibition doesn't work"" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws. These would be laws regarding our bodies. Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work. People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please.    Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.   Holy cow you've got to be joking! Victimizes women?! Let me start a new debate for this alone. Please visit it at  http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Do_magazines_victimize_women    I'm all for teaching kids what's best for them. And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves. And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make. It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex.    Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  And this is a fine way to teach sexual education. I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous. We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain. Not doing so is heartless.   As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here. That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate.   Final thought:  Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you. My only ""push"" is that you  not  push legislation on others based solely on  your  moral beliefs.",0,1

116,"Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.

Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.   Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.  views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.   Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.  An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this?   Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.  The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.  Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded.

I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me.   Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.   Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.   About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.   Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place.

So in reality  your  central theme seems to be sex.   I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution.   This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad.   It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that.

118,"Actually, depending on what is allowed in ""abstinence"", it may not. Oral sex, for instance, can transmit STD's, and many abstinent teens turn to oral sex as a way to satisfy their sexual desires.   I'm arguing that sexual desires are natural. It's easy to succumb to those desires and so abstinence-only education is weak. It ignores the fact that some people will CHOOSE not to remain abstinent. And that these people deserve facts on having safe sex. And furthermore, that if we made contraception more widely available to those who choose not to be abstinent, we can drastically cut down on the numbers of abortions.",0,1

127,"Nobody has the right to another person's body. A woman has the right, for lack of a better term, evict. It is her body, she does not have to gestate for 9 months if she doesn't want to. Arguments about having sex mean you accept pregnancy are ludicrous.  Look at it this way. We don't require parents to give up their organs, or their blood, or their extra kidney, or even their bone marrow in order to save the life of their 1 year old child. If that child needed a transplant or it dies, we do not force the parents to donate. even something like Bone marrow, that will not kill them. We don't force anyone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want to.  So why would we force a woman to keep the fetus alive. It uses her kidneys, blood, lungs, etc. Pregnancy can cause health problems and complications worse than being a bone marrow donor, or even a kidney donor. Why would the law force a woman to go through pregnancy until the fetus is born, but not require the parents to keep the born child alive? Why does the fetus get special protection that a child does not?   The woman needs to choose to gestate for 9 months, and accept the risks that go with it at every stage. She has the right to change her mind if the risks become to great, or even her awareness of the risks become too great.

Much like no believing in unicorns or leprechauns or anything else people claim exists but can't prove exists.

Women ages 20-24 are not out of high school adn college. a 4 year degree means you graduate when you are 22, some may never go but some also get higher degrees or go part time, or take a year off - so many 20-24 year olds are not out of college.",0,1

She agrees  He hooks her up, so she is supporting the childs life. After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded, and gets scared.

132,"Abortion is right because the moral values that ""pro life"" advocates usually hold is that of religious sediments, most of the time disregarding whether or not abortion is helpful to society. Abortion prevents unwanted children, and or growth in areas where we most certainly wouldn't want it. Abortion increases happy family rates, and higher average level of education among families. A fetus is, for all intents and purposes, part of the women until removed from the women, and before any pro lifers try to mince those words I'll go outright and say yes it does mean I support the abortion of a child no matter the stage of development, an unwanted baby that couldn't be dealt with for whatever reason at one point weeks is no different from a unwanted baby at another. Ignorant religious people argue that such barbaric elimination of human life is evil, but I find it odd that they would object to something that would result in the immediate entry to heaven(by my knowledge Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe babies who die go straight to heaven). Why subject them to the hardships of life when they aren't wanted? I also agree with the fact that mothers should have the only say in whether or not she has an abortion( I also believe however that a man who wants an abortion but gets denied should have the right to be exempt from child support) My ideas on the subject go into extremes far beyond normal pro choice standards, but I honestly feel satisfaction in knowing I support something that is beneficial to society. And before anyone questions the lack of ""morals"" behind my believes just know that in our modern world, ""morality"" has no meaning, just different perceptions developed from our understanding of religion. Without religion there would be no such thing as ""evil"". I prefer to live in a world driven by logic, and to that point abortion is a logical way to better structure the family units in the world today.",0,1
133,"""Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?""  Because it's part of the woman until birth.   ""If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions.""  You are not one to judge what is the correct way of taking responsibility.   I'd argue more but you don't go anywhere beyond the whole ""life deserves a chance"" stance. You say you read into both sides but I don't believe that as I see no reference to the societal benefits of abortion in your response.",0,1
134,"""Atheism is a religion""  No it's not. I view atheism is the theory that there isn't a god, and under those contexts it isn't a religion because it doesn't group in any way shape or form.  ""I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....""  Yes I dropped the fear of being open in my views no matter how extreme they are. Cold, maybe, but compassionless? No, at least not by the standard I hold myself to believing that it helps society. Empty? definitely not, my view has a defined purpose that only seems wrong by the dim standards developed by the main religions of the world.(you will hear me criticize religion whenever I see logic spawned from religion born patterns of thinking.  ""I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.""  I respectfully agree.  ""Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close.""   I respect Hitler's ability to have fixed the economy of Germany, yes. I don't care for the extermination of a race, no. I don't believe it's wrong to admire the positive side to a negative situation.  ""They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb""  I do believe it's right(womb not the killing of functioning members of society), Im not going to play the shifty democrat here and change my positions constantly which will appall you in the coming comment most likely.   ""Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated?""  Yes I do because that is a solution to quell inheritable diseases in our species that produce members that cannot add anything to society, let alone enjoy a standard of independent life(this view applies to major disabilities, I am undecided on minor diseases that produce somewhat capable members.) As of IQ, I would love to be rid of stupid people but stupidity supplies the labor of current society I guess so not much can be done there.  ""Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.""   And there are children that grow up in an orphanage, tormented by the fact that not only did their parents not want them ,nobody else did either. That is a foundation of an unstable mind that could result in something very bad.  ""Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone. ""  It increases happy family rates by keeping the family unit at a desired number.  ""Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share""  The stigma you refer to only exists due to the unfortunate inescapable entity that is religion. And if living with an abortion is hard, then living with a child you can't take care of is harder. My evidence for that last statement being me and my mother.  ""Studies show that what I am saying is true.""   Not disputing what you are saying is true, just disputing the meaning and reason behind it.   ""If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over""   The statistics however few I have presented are more or less citations from my private political theory professor Hollis. Wish I knew her first name but never felt the need to until years after being taught.   ""Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education?""   Again a loose citation but this one is more obvious. In countries with a higher reproduction rate then normal almost always live in poverty or at the very least a low standard of living. Bangladesh anyone? However, in countries with a normal or even lower then normal reproduction rate, the level of education is much higher, and that isn't by any means hard to justify.   ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24&#xNo;w this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  Okay? I also believe in using abortion as a birth control, although the pill seems a much better option to me.  ""Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion""  Well repetition is the way to learn i guess.   ""Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up?""  No I said the educational level of the family unit goes up, which is true, due to the fact that when you aren't forced to pay for the schooling of a kid you didn't want, then you have much more to get better schooling for a kid you did want.  ""Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically. She talked at KKK meetings encouraging its members to target blacks. The Negro Project, Eugenic plan for Blacks....read them they will tell you all about her racism. ""  I don't care about her being racist. Racism is just a held view, no different then holding a preference over pulp or pulp free in your orange juice. In the field of political theory, in which I have a considerable holding, racism doesn't exist, only racial preference which actually for the sake of argument increases effectiveness among a people. Attack that if you must, but bear in mind I still have not indicated whether or not I have a preference, so don't waste too much time on it.  ""The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order,"" Sanger said.""  It is quite the negative influence when we consider the very structure of the human mind mixed with the animalistic side of our species that society strives so hard to contain, but that is a part of society not likely too change.  ""She was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks. She was an inspiration to Hitler...and obviously her views still guide PP and others like you today.""  I am not for forced abortion or mass sterilization of blacks, I merely hold that abortions are a greatly positive thing in society and shouldn't by any means be discouraged. I don't care much about racial differences except how they pertain to statistics involving the economy. And like I said before, I may agree with some parts of a persons beliefs and not the other. Just because I may or may not agree with some similarly held beliefs of Margaret Sanger does not mean I by any means am inspired by her.  ""Your thinking is dangerous to society. You presume to know what is good for society...and that good has all to do with killing. Both Hitler and Sanger believed what you are saying. Look where Hitlers worldview took him.....and the others he mass murdered.""  Dangerous? No more so then religion is. At least my ""danger"" is in the name of logical progression of society and whether or not you see it that way is irrelevant. You seem to refer to Hitler in most of your debates, I believe Mao Zedong would be a much better example for the logic you are using, just a suggestion.   ""I find what you say about men and abortion commical. I am certainly praying at this point you have no children and won't. I can only imagine how they would be raised.""  I be a wonderful dad, I would let them grow their own beliefs on god and structure, those things are up to them to figure out. My duty would be protection and learning of basic functions. It is not my place in my standing to dictate how my child views thing in the world around him. If he wants to be pro life, all the power to him, as long as he(or she) truly believes in what the hold I am fine.   ""You say the woman should have the say.....and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby. Ahhhh you poor thing....not included.""  Yes i do believe that. I don't think he should be able to back out if he decides to pay child support, but I do believe he should have a choice. That is probably the most destructive belief I have portrayed, but to win some you gotta give some, and the women won rights to chose whether or not they have an abortion.  ""Libertarian worldview.....all about themselves, nothing about anyone else...a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life. Liberty for your kind is slavery, killing those they think are unworthy to live. Freedom of expression for you people is the gun....pointed at someones head. No absolutes....people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society, even if it hurts their own family. ""  That is incorrect to the extreme but I am not here to argue my party standings. I could go on about your religion and get quite insulting, but for the sake of argument I hope you will drop your attacks on the Libertarian party and respect us for our views as I have respected you without insult(if one has slipped through the cracks I apologize, but I don't remember making an insult).   ""Your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral...that speak to your conscience and lack of one. For you rape could be good in some circumstances....and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live. God only knows who is in that group.""  Yes they are radical, I am not going to deny that. And there is no such thing as moral or right or wrong. I think in terms such as beneficial and destructive. And god doesn't know because he doesn't exist. I may seem colder then usually imaginable, but when faced with issue such as abortion we must think about what is best for society. And I am actually quite the party animal, but here I am here to be logical and maybe have a beer when done.   ""Your worldview is not logical at all in fact I find it hidiously evil and dangerous. It strips away the preciousness of life and living. What a sad world you live in. Which is why those that value life....need to keep you close.""  It is logical as all my views come from a deep understanding of political theory and my understanding of what makes the human mind and what differentiates it from that of an animal(not much). No such thing as evil, said that already. And you misunderstand my intentions. In benefiting society we promote what makes us human. Progression, thinking, in making society a better place we make the world a better place. And my world is sad by no means.I seek only to progress my knowledge and thoughts of world issues. I thank you for having the courtesy of making a quite lengthy response.",0,1
135,"Such a small and lacking response makes me regret complimenting your previous one.   ""So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?""  If it was detected during pregnancy yes I would definitely want an abortion but once it has been born it has entered the realm of society where my line is drawn. You make me out to be some serial killer yet you don't expound on how the reason behind it is flawed, you only call me evil and insult my beliefs and party.   ""You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?""   Yes if a defect is detected during pregnancy. Now I am not saying they have to, I am saying that if it was up to me I would choose an abortion, and if you believe that is wrong due to your close minded perception of morality, then that is of no consequence to me. You are trying to run a perceptive analytical argument and it is frustrating me because my source of these views is based on that of a separate pattern of thinking, I am coming from a place of thought and logic, you are coming form a place born from what you perceive to be ""right"" or ""moral"" when in fact you have little to no understanding of the impacts such thinking has had on society and yet you call me a danger.

137,"""Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,"" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.""  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   ""The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists""  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  ""no law respecting an establishment of religion""  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that ""other"" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future.

I'm not trying to side anyone's reason. I'm just saying that the World has to work in accordance with the right amount.

I'm not going to say that there is never a choice. There always is a choice. Look... Sometimes, giving birth to a baby is risky. It might mean the mother's life too...    What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   Yeah.. Give birth to it then, when it can fully understand the meaning of pain and let it die. While you could have saved it all the pain. All that torture. Like... We had a nuclear tragedy in India. The birth effects are just preposterous. Kids died when they reached the age of 1 or 2. The mothers were denied of abortions, not by the hospitals but the family members. Some of the women weren't healthy enough for the birth process and hence they died. Even today Women are forced despite their health conditions.  I do not say it is right. But, it is never just a Yes or a No. There are always issues. There must be exceptions. To certain things. Certain 'unavoidable' things.  I agree with everything that you mention. It isn't wrong.

His wife was pregnant. The baby inside of his wife was killed in the process of the mother being killed.  If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?!  Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?  Your taking away the life of some creature that has not yet experienced life yet.  The baby moves, blinks, kicks, and squirms inside the mother, this is the sign that it is alive and is capable of understanding of what is doing (not of everything its doing) and human beings do just the same.   So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.   And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?   Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.  Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder.  People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option.

So many liberals out there try to paint this idealistic picture that you can make stupid decisions without any real consequences, but that's simply not true. When you have unprotected sex, a baby is conceived. At that moment, whether the baby has a pumping heart or not, it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby. That could mean one of many options, such as raising the baby yourself, putting it up for adoption, or any number of alternatives. But I will tell you, as basic human decency should tell you, that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable.   You chose to act irresponsibly. Now you must face the consequences, and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being.  Now, of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions. In these cases, I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have. She did nothing wrong, and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist. But at the same time, I still believe that life begins at conceptions, and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make. Do you believe in giving life to another human being, filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself, or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman?

166,"In your hypothetical, the woman is not aware of the impending accident. If a person goes hiking, they aren't expecting of an accident to occur, or they would not have undertaken it in the first place. Pregnancy is different because it requires sex which is a decision that everyone knows may result in pregnancy. Now you may think, ""Taking a hike in no man's land is also a decision that includes risk"" and you'd be right. But I believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion. I am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent (by deliberate decision or otherwise) they are responsible for the safety of that new human. Even to the extent of risking their own lives. That is my definition of assuming responsibility for the risks. That being said, I don't think there should be laws in place to  force  people to carry thorough a pregnancy, or donate blood to their injured child. But I believe it to be immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over that of their children. Born or not.",0,2

The fetus being killed most certainly has been started. It is a human being. It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns. Is it OK to kill them too?  I will agree with you other point that women (and men) should be able to do whatever it is they want to their own bodies. But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.

No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite.   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.    Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply disallowing the fetus to continue living within her.   Thus killing a human being.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of ""parasite"" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?",0,2

The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive   Every single part of your body can be considered alive, except your nails and hair and a few others, I believe. Cutting off a piece of skin holds no moral issues for you, I would guess, it's a similar idea. Except a foetus will cost thousands of pounds/dollars/euros, will take thousands of hours of time, will restrict you throughout your entire life, cause you to be labelled because of it, and cause you to endure a huge amount of hardship from it. There are reasons for abortion as well, studies have shown that about three quarters of women choose them because of financial reasons, hardly their choice.   Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it   I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.   Actually, humans kill thousands of life forms every single second, just because it's seen as morally wrong there is a big issue with abortion. Why should it be morally wrong? Please give me a reason why it is so intrinsically bad to take a life with no emotion?  I would suggest that Pro-Lifer's are not necessarily blind to truth, they see it, they simply ignore the truth of what happens to those who are not allowed abortions. Abortion rates does not change massively when it is outlawed, all that happens is they do it illegally and unsafely. Further, the argument made by Republican candidates is that abortion should be outlawed to protect the 'nuclear family'. Hardly relevant, as typical, married, happy, nuclear families would not get abortions a significant amount of the time. Give me a convincing argument as to why abortion is so bad.",0,1
205,"Ok, I'm amazed you're actually being this ridiculous about a simple name.   Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference.   Pro abortion means you want abortions. Pro choice means you want the choice of abortions. There is a  big  difference.  I do not like that people get abortions. I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother.  It's common for pro lifers to accuse pro-choice supporters of being blind to the facts, when it is they who rarely actually consider the women that they're condemning.   Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?   I think it's bad, I'm asking you why it's so bad. You haven't answered any of my questions, you've simply said that it's bad and that it's the same as pro-abort.   Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months?

206,"They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing.   And there you go. They don't want abortions, they want the option.   So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL   Yes, pretty much. I think religion is bad, but I'd never consider taking it away from people. I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support. Just as Voltaire said  'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' , I feel the same way about abortion.   Nothing is good about abortion.   That's not true.  No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.   We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution   No, you are. I am not American. Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens. When a foetus has citizenship, it gains the right to life. To do that, it must be born.

By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.",0,1
217,"""Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.""  First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion. Instead, what I did was set out generic examples on why abortion should be acceptable and unacceptable. If we were to debate about specific cases, there would be no end to possibilities that we could conjure. And secondly, I never wrote that 'killings were okay', I used the word acceptable throughout my point, and that brings a different weightage and seriousness to the issue. Not just one where, it is ""okay"" or ""not okay"" as if we were picking vegetables at a supermarket.  ""Abortion is a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'? ""  I never implied that abortion is a painless process, it is a very physically and emotionally painful process that may scar one for life. But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'. Instead, they should face up to what they have did and actually consider about raising the life that they created and not kill it simply because they just wanted the pleasure of sex at the point and nothing else. Of course I'm generalizing here by saying that teenagers are irresponsible people, but truth be told, many teenagers choose abortion as the easy way out, when actually they might be able to raise a child with the support of their families. How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned? Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners? If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.   ""It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.  Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.""  I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance. And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place would she? Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.",0,2

If she doesn't use any precaution, then it's her fault for being irresponsible and she should carry the baby to term. Adoption is very successful and if she doesn't want to go through that, then she could always raise the baby anyway. Now if she uses protection in some form, but it fails, then she could always take a morning after pill, like Plan B. Pills like that safely ""miscarry"", for lack of better term, before the egg and sperm become fertilized. Other than that, she has no right to end a life.

I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting. Is that not pain? And if you think about it, it does damage the population.

What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?   Also, the difference between a fetus that can be destroyed in a 'Partial-birth"" abortion and a live baby that has full protection of the law is a distance of only a few inches down the birth canal.

283,"Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life. When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked."" Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib? Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds. Even if you don't believe abortion is murder, it still demeans the value of human life, since women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.  Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control. There are dozens of birth control methods that can keep you from becoming pregnant, including the 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.  The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out. What would the world be like if the mothers of Abe Lincoln, George Washington, or Thomas Edison had had an abortion? Just maybe a woman has become pregnant despite all birth control attempts because the child is destined to do something great.  Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child. Many women who have abortion in their younger years end up living the rest of their lives in perpetual guilt. Even if that women doesn't consider it murder at the time, that may change as she matures. Even Jane Roe (not her real name), the original woman behind the famous court decision, has completely changed her mind on abortion. She filed a petition to have the decision overturned to help relieve the guilt of hundreds of thousands of needless deaths she blames on herself. Also, let's not forget that there are two parents of every aborted child. The father may feel just as guilty. The father may even want the child, but he has no choice if the mother chooses abortion.  The advances of genetic testing may prompt more abortions (to avoid having the non-ideal child). All of us who have or want kids imagine them growing up to be doctors, senators, sports stars, or whatever. But what would you do if you knew the child would have Down's Syndrome? What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? What if the child had a strong risk of schizophrenia? Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion? As genetic knowledge continues to grow, we are able to determine more and more about what a child will be like as an adult. Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.  There are many couples who spend years on waiting lists trying to adopt a child. The number of couples out there who cannot have a child of their own for physical reasons are too numerous to count. The waiting list for adopting babies can be 5-10 years or more. Young women in their teens are right to be concerned that they're not ready to effectively raise a child. However, if that is the case, there are plenty of wonderful people out there who are. Not only would you be bringing a valuable life into the world, you'd also be making the dream of a childless couple come true.  The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults, who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions. There's a good reason why we don't allow people to drink alcohol, smoke, or drive until they're a certain age. It's because they haven't matured enough to make good, sound decisions. We've all made bad decisions in our younger years that provide us with life experience to make sounder judgment in the future. The one skill that seems to take the longest time to develop is the ability to consider the feelings and needs of someone besides ourselves. Why should such a life or death decision as abortion be made by a person who probably hasn't developed that capacity?   People have the right not to see their tax dollars go to something they find immoral. Abortion is a medical procedure that must be performed by a doctor. The government contributes to many health care institutions such as Healthcare for the Homeless, Planned Parenthood, free clinics, etc. All of us who pay taxes have the right to prevent that money from going to something we consider murder.   Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child. The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen. Just because the babies can't speak for themselves doesn't mean they have no rights. If a 1-month old is murdered, it that really different than abortion as far as protecting an American's life? If a person shoots and kills a pregnant woman, shouldn't the punishment be more severe? If you legalize abortion, it would tell the courts there is no difference.   Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility. Abortion exposes woman to a number of health risks including, but not limited to, infection, sterility, and in rare cases, death. A number of short-term symptoms such as bleeding, fever, nausea, and vomiting are also common.   Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath. Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"". It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed. Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism. Killing a human being doesn't serve any higher medical purpose and is therefore a violation of the oath.",0,2

291,"You are ignoring the fact that most abortions are for convenience, not rape or any medical need. The most common reasons women consider abortion are:  Per webmd.com ""The most common reasons women consider abortion are: 1. Birth control (contraceptive) failure. Over half of all women who have an abortion used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant.2 Inability to support or care for a child. 3. To end an unwanted pregnancy. 4. To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems. Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.5. Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. 6. Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued.  If the pro-life community were to all agree today that all rape victims should be given abortions (if desired) and then loved without reservation until they are (somewhat) whole again, the pro-abortion industry would give not one inch on their opposition to any restrictions on unlimited abortions. The 'pregnant rape victim' is a red herring, meant only to emotionalize the issue in their favor.",0,2
292,"Per EHow.com...""The are five methods used when performing an abortion. The first is called Manual Vacuum Aspiration and can be used early in the pregnancy. The doctor inserts a thin tube into the woman's uterus and sucks the embryo out with the syringe attached at the end of the tube. The second, Suction Curettage, is the most common kind of abortion and can be performed later in the pregnancy. The doctor must stretch the cervix with rods, due to the size of the baby, and then inserts a plastic tube that is connected to a suction machine. Once inserted, the baby's body is and suctioned out in pieces. The third is called Dilation and Evacuation and is considered a second trimester abortion. At this stage, the baby is too big to be broken apart by only the use of suction. Seaweed rods are inserted into the woman a day or two before the procedure to stretch her cervix. The doctor will use forceps to pull the fetus out of the woman. A looped knife called a curette is used to scrape remaining fetal parts out of the woman's body. The fourth method is called a Dilation and Extraction, and can be through full term. This procedure takes three days, and during the first two, seaweed rods are used again to stretch the cervix. The doctor will then use an ultrasound to locate the baby's legs, taking them with forceps and pulling every part out with the exception of its head. He will then make a cut into the baby's skull, suctioning out its brains which, makes it easier to pull the baby out of the woman's body. Finally, there is the development of RU 486, an abortion pill. Early in her pregnancy, a woman is given a pill in the doctor's office to abort the embryo and is sent home with 2 to 3 pills to be inserted vaginally. This will induce stomach cramps and expel the embryo.

294,"My argument is very simple.   By having sex, one acknowledges the possible repercussions of that act. Primarily being 1) being impregnated and 2) getting an STD.   By having sex, one realizes it might end up Ina pregnancy. No form of protection is 100% effective. So anyone having sex should be able to have the responsibility of having a child.   Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus? It is life. It is human life from a few hours after conception when the gander has become a zygote with the DNA addition of the father. The killing of human life is not a fair outcome for someone not at fault for anything.",0,2

Even with protection, the parents are fully accept g (or rationally should be) that a pregnancy is a possible outcome of their...activities. So to have sex, even with protection, one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes, however unlikely.   Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life.   Human=homo sapien. A zygote has the DNA of a homo sapien. It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead. Life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the OED.    a zygote is not a sentient human being.   Did you think I wouldn't notice your clever addition? It is a human being (organism). You can't argue against that.",0,2

Puns aside, how? For example, the colloquial definition of a ""theory"" and a scientific definition of a ""theory"" are completely different. I don't accept your givens to be true.

And I can give many that are not.   Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive   I thought you would have thought this out more.

Yet, knowing this AND knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work, they still had sex. They put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing.    That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   That is an awful analogy. A better analogy would be if the Haitians had placed thousands of tons of high explosives on the fault line and blew them up and were surprised there was an earthquake.   I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition. Yes, there are scientific definitions, but that is irrelevant because you chose to ignore them in favor of an inappropriate one.    Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged?   Nope. That is a lie.

The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring. By making it a pleasure activity, you corrupt its true purpose. Now this is fine as long as one is prepared for that stupid, implausible. far-fetched, unlikely, ludicrous scenario where... what is actually supposed to happen happens. Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   And none of which are usually fatal.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases. I am on the side of life. If death is the result in either case, why put the parents through unneeded trauma? And my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape, thus, it is my only other exception.   That was not my point.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.

I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   Well then How does human not equal homo sapien?   I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong.

From either perspective (with the exception of rape). Thus, people should be held responsible for their actions. In this case, that means raising a child.  The entire purpose of sex is for fertilization to occur. It isn't an ""accident"" at all. It is deliberate and intentional.    An earthquake could be natural.

I believe in abortion in cases where:  - the mother and/or father are too young to support a child, or the mother and/or father are in a situation that would not be a positive environment for a child (ie, abusive relationship(s), poverty/homelessness, etc.);  - the mother's/fetus's life is at risk,  - the fetus is the result of a rape or incestuous encounter;  - the fetus has a  very  high chance of developing some debilitating disease/malformation that will make its developing life difficult.  In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives, they should not use abortion as a Plan B.

315,"Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life.   When it comes to rape, women can have choice to abort or not abort. I support either decision. However, it is immoral to abort always. I also believe it is selfish.   If you are just careless, don't abort. It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault. Why not the man's fault too? Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.   But this topic is pointless. Selfish or not, a murderer will kill, a rapists will rape, a ""abortionist"" will abortion. What are you going to do? Keep an eye on the woman? You can and i believe you are doing a good deed. But i am not going to spend the rest of my life watching over a woman and stopping her from getting an abortion EVERY time.

Abortion is over very quickly indeed, and completely painless in the first trimester and a month and a bit after.

Had I been aborted, I would have been spared the agony of dealing with hypocrites--the most prevalent and destructive types the human race has ever known.

343,I'm personally against abortion.  We must look at the reasons women have abortions. In general it has to do with irresponsibility. Very rarely the reasons are medical or rape. Should society be responsible for a females irresponsibility?  Another problem I have is the availability. The first thought that comes to the mind is abortion. If the couple feel they will have financial difficulties - abortion is the first answer. Not improving their home economics or getting better jobs. Abortion should always be the last action - not the first.  However in this society I don't think we can live without abortion. It's like coffee - we don't need it.. but we choose to be controlled by it. So if we are to keep it - it should be heavily regulated.,0,2
344,"So I do agree on what you say, ""society be responsible for a females irresponsibility"".  I wasn't making a statement. I actually disagree.  Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive. I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that. lol. We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity.  People should learn from their mistakes. If I killed someone - should I not be put in jail? As punishment - time for reflection etc? Or should I be allowed to continue because going to jail puts a burden on society, doesn't actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job etc. would be much harder?  You're right however. People born in poor conditions (which abortions tend to negate) tend to get caught up in the cycle. Abortion isn't the answer. Less sex - or sex only with the right people is.",0,2
345,"Has teenage sex been rising or falling since sex education has been introduced?  Yes, there are tons of other reasons for this correlation. Sex is everywhere. Should it be in schools too? Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex? If you're going to start teaching them atleast do it once they're legally allowed to have sex. Maybe sex education could lead to a decrease in sexual activity - but with a conservative, not a liberal attitude.   I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.   You're wrong. They do it again all the time.  Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays (that's not including rape). Because of the attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them. But we all know that until the age of atleast 19 (and that's still young) nobody understands love. In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'.  Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex. Maybe that's because it was different times and there weren't tits in their face every other second. But atleast if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.",0,2
346,"Wow. You actually hit the nail on the spot for the reasons for increased teen sexual behaviour. But let me make it clear (again). I don't blame sexual education. It's one of the reasons.  I think we only disagree on the concept of sex education. Or our experiences of it anyway.  It is good to be taught to practice safe sex. It is good to learn about the dangers/consequences of sex. But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex, they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.  Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The messege was have sex - but make it safe. Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe. The problem is the liberal attitude. Liberal sex education = bad. That's my point.  P.S.

349,"Ugh, whenever I go into an abortion debate it gives me the distinct feeling of going to war.  Anyway, I am pro choice, because I think if you force the woman to have a child you should cut the pretense and just shove a baby-sized object up there without her consent. Roughly the same trauma and pain would be delivered except without the finiancial damage to go along with it.  I rank most orphanages as somewhere within the 9th ring of hell, at least the ones I have visisted, so adoption would just be meaner to the ""life"".  Besides, let's throw a little bit of perspective. An egg in a woman's body is always there, always waiting, and is flushed out once a month and replaced with another one. That egg is potential for life. Conception conshmeption, all the eggs are potential humans. Same for sperm (Which means I must have a higher death count than Adolf Hitler).  Now, as for fetus-is-life arguement, let's look again. See a picture of a fetus, then see a picture of a baby, or normal human. The fetus has almost no mental nor emotional functions. It's brain is not even fully developed. Even dogs can claim that their brains are fully developed. It's body is not fully developed for life outside the womb either. Until it's able to claim a basically developed human body with a basically developed human mind, it's not human (third trimester being included).  Unless you are ready to take in that unwanted child, feed it, raise it, and let it be its own person, or providing the necessary money and support to do so, do not say you are ""protecting"" life. Saving someone from being murdered is protecting life. Giving money to the homeless so they can buy something to eat is protecting life. Signing a petition saying women should be forced to live with their mistakes (not even theirs if it's rape) is not protecting life.",0,1

I had two children already and had been basically tricked into a pregnancy I did not want. My boys were older, I had my life together and did not want another child. The issue was pushed by my partner and I was given an ultimatum. I got pregnant and he left 8 weeks into it. I was backed against a wall, scared, confused. How would I care for 3 children alone? I made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas ( hours and hours from where I lived. ) Once there I broke down in the parking lot and drove all the way home. I went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a gorgeous little girl, met a guy that has been her dad for the last 5 years and I am reminded everytime I look at her, that the only thing that separated her from death was my unwillingness to walk up a flight of stairs.

372,"People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society.   But prior to this, they can. Besides, we know that they are human beings anyway. They are independent of a natural host, and would be able to do the things I specified if they weren't afflicted by a condition. My concern is that I doubt a fetus could do those things regardless of condition.    is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance.   Not until the third trimester, in which abortion is illegal anyway. A fetus cannot do any of the things I specified maximally, if at all, prior to the third trimester. It is, by definition, a parasite until about 20 weeks or so.    how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?   Because I obviously disagree that a fetus can do those things.   It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to.   I know that. But when we are talking about defining  human  life, the sexual one is the only definition that matters.    Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.   I'm not disputing that they are alive. I'm disputing on the grounds that asexual reproduction is not human, which is all that needs to be considered. Thus, a fetus does not have all the biological features you or I have from the moment of conception. It also lacks many other things, but those aren't necessary for me to disagree with your premises.   I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases.   A few hypothetical scenarios then..   1.  A mother has been raped. Yay or nay to abortion, and why?   2.  The mother will suffer serious health problems if she carries to full term. Yay or nay?   3.  The baby will suffer serious health problems when birthed. Yay or nay?   4.  A train is heading down a track. If not diverted, it will kill a fetus (hypothetically speaking).

Newborns are not independent of their natural host   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.    Left alone they will die of thirst.   Well, so will anything. I don't see what relevance this poses.    a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult.   Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus. A fetus cannot survive independently until the third trimester, when abortion is illegal.    However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults)   See above.    You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.    A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.   See my first point.   f this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.   I do understand this. What I mean is, the way a human passes it's genes down is through sexual reproduction. A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.    I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed.   Firstly, I would like to say how little knowledge I have on this subject. So if I say anything stupid or offensive, it's nothing malicious, just ignorant.  OK, I'll accept that she is asexual. But she can't reproduce asexually, right? Meaning she has no reproductive capability. If she was able to reproduce, it would be sexually, not asexually? If so, my point still stands.   A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it)   I like that analogy. So I'll give my own spin.  A builder asks you if you want a new kitchen fitted for free. Obviously, you agree. You're very considerate and respectful to the builder, as he's doing it for free. You give him tea, coffee, breaks, all the perks he wants.A day later, you ask him how he's doing with the kitchen. He hands you the blueprints, and says, ""I'm working on it.""   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just ""working on it.""   Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.    Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her. The difference between an adult woman and a fetus, is that the woman is, without a doubt, entitled to human rights. The right to choose what she does with her body. The fact that the fetus' rights are in doubt, lets the woman take precedent.    Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?   The right to choose.    Nay. Again this is unfortunate, but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not? If this were acceptable, the retarded, disfigured, and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning.   I'll accept that one.   Nothing, read my response to this:   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.",0,1

There are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions.  On the other hand, there are many instances where birth control has failed, cannot be taken due to allergies, or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a woman’s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy.  As for not being able to sustain a baby financially, emotionally, or intellectually, adoption is an option, saying that you want to abort because you didn't  feel  like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and shouldn't be encouraged or supported.",0,1
377,"When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant.   Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?    You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do?   Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.    Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong?   No, I wouldn’t want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it (assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception). Religious ethics based on the idea of ‘sin’ or ‘evil’ has no effect on my decision; it’s about how I was raised.   What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Abortion is a murder.   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   But everybody has a right to be wrong.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.    Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion.   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really  fix  it?   How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.  I am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place. As for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control, i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want's to be a mom or have an abortion. I don't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions. If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.",0,1
378,"Birth control is not 100 percent effective; one of my coworkers was on birth control and conceived. Now she is a proud mother.   Conceiving while on birth control isn't always due to incorrect application or use of the birth control, sometimes a person just falls into that .01 percent where the birth control failed to do what it was meant to. In that sense, considering a person taking it who didn't intend on having a baby and the birth control failed, I would support her if she decided to have an abortion.  And who's to say those who are allergic to certain types of birth control aren't already considering the possibility of conceiving? Would thinking ""of the consequences before... sex"" justify a person’s decision if they conceived and wanted an abortion? If not then why even bring that up?",0,1
379,"Not even close?  It may not be a human  person,  but as far as DNA is concerned, it is 100 percent a human  fetus.   I think the question then is what makes a thing a person, and whether or not a fetus is that.",0,1
380,"Is an acorn a tree?  Is an egg a chicken?  So on and so on... Grow up..   No, but an acorn is the nut of an oak tree, and a chicken egg is the egg of a chicken, it would be a scientific anomaly if they were to grow into anything else. Are you denying that we are referring to a human fetus? what did you think this debate was about?  Regardless, we’re not talking about an acorn or egg, both of those have all the necessary parts to develop into their adult counterparts on their own, save for proper sunlight and water for the seed or warmth for the egg. A human fetus requires another life to create it and then sustain it until well into adolescence. Whether it is a nine week old fetus or a nine day old newborn baby, it requires another life form. This should be considered  before  people decide to just skip out on the birth control and take the risk of having an unwanted pregnancy.   Personally I don't give a fuck if people get abortions, I doesn't affect me in the least so why should I care? Living things die every day; death is just a part of life. What I  do  care about are people taking responsibility for their actions. If you don't want a baby, no duh, don't get pregnant. If you take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy and get pregnant anyway or if, god forbid, you were to get raped, then by all means, have an abortion if that’s what you want. No skin off my nose.  And what’s with the personal insult? Grow up? I think it’s obvious from that remark alone that I am not the one lacking maturity. Personal attacks like that have no place in a debate.",0,2

382,"[In my point of view, abortion shouldn't be banned. Abortion is a not bad thing for women, especially for teenagers. Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong, but most of those people even haven't been pregnant. It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion, but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice.   When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Abortion is not very good, of course. But it is not wrong. It is a choice. It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant. You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do? Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong? I don't think so. You would think, even for a minute you would think about abortion.  What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Abortion is a murder. I agree with that. But everybody has a right to be wrong. Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it. We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion. As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child.

If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   So, I can say that all of us make mistakes, we are not perfect. Nobody does. But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes.   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.  But if woman decided not to have a child, it is not wrong.  It is not good, but not wrong.]",0,1
383,"Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   No, of course each person has his own opinion, but most of people judge other people. A lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion. But everybody has to have own opinion. I have mine, as well as you have yours.    Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?   Hey, there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant. I wrote it just as an example, because I know one girl who was in that situation.    Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.   Well, you would, but there are a lot of people who wouldn’t accept responsibility. As I said, I know someone who was in that situation, and it was really hard for her to make a choice.    Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Yes it is a good option, but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption, when you gave a birth to him, when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months. Also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period. It is not so easy to be pregnant ‘alone’ (if we are talking about that bad situation)   Yes, people should think before having sex, but everybody makes mistakes. And everybody solves their problems as they can. Somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby, but somebody cannot. It is their choice. :)   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   You confused me. )) I didn’t get you. I didn’t mean lawful, or unlawful. I meant that by abortion people kill their babies.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.   A privilege? Don’t know. I think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good.   Everybody can be wrong. Do you agree with that? We cannot live without mistakes. It teaches us how to be better, by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong, or something like that.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   I agree with you, that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes. But there could be different situations, when people cannot control them. Somebody are not wise enough, somebody doesn’t think before doing something. But life is intended for us to self-perfection. It is a life. We learn from the mistakes of a lifetime. Somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something, somebody can understand from the mistakes of others. People are different. That is why our life is very interesting. :)   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   In our society it wouldn’t be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldn’t be punished. Of course they should be punished. But in my opinion they should be punished only be God. But our society wouldn’t accept it, and I understand why. We are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that, because it is a good way for other people to live quietly. So that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail, for example. They are also people. They just make more serious mistakes like murder, or something.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really fixit?   I think it is. In any case, it would be better then doing nothing, right? The most important thing when you understand you mistakes. Of course, a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed. :) it is impossible physically, but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too I think. Have you seen the film “Seven pounds” with Will Smith? This film describes what I am talking about very good. He killed 7 people, and it was his mistake. But after that he helped 7 other people. I understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it.    If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Yes, in my opinion, it is a best solution, but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example, you cannot give the money back to him. In that case, you can give them to somebody who needs it. may be for charity? )   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.   Yes, it is a good option, of course. But there are several options: to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself, to give him to an adoption agency, or to have an abortion. (there can be some other options, I don’t know). But each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions.    If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.   A agree with you. But there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves, that is why we have a lot of options.   Of course, I wouldn’t have an abortion, because I love children and I want them, but I do not exclude it. If I would in a situation I described earlier, I would do it. But in other cases I wouldn’t.   But abortion is not wrong.   Abortion is an option. Option which is judged by someone, which is supported by someone, which is not understandable by someone, but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other people’s opinions. And that is their choice.",0,1

470,"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.   Had the fetus not been terminated, it could've had so much potential. It would grow up to be a child. It would get to listen to music, smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow. Everything we take for granted in life and life itself, is taken from the fetus.   Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore, it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion. In the same sense, is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life? Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness. This argument is irrational and morally incorrect.  What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision. The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live. It is not her choice to make. It is no one's choice to make. No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life. Imagine the world without you, because your mother had an abortion. You would never live all of your experiences. You would never have emotions. You would've never existed. Such is the travesty of abortion. Over a million lives, of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years, would never be lived.  Rape, sadly does happen. But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem. If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself. Harsher penalities, stricter monitoring policies, promoting rape whistles, reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this. Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible, but we can get this number a lot lower.   Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives. Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences.  Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone. We cannot continue with this madness.",0,2
471,"Destroying a fetus is like destroying a part of yourself. One's genes, blood and cells are within the body of a their fetus, yet they undergo an abortion and prevent a human life from being lived. A fetus does not deserve to be denied life, because the fetal stage is probably is the stage of life where we are morally the most neutral. We cannot think for ourselves, nor can we comprehend good or bad. On this basis, infants are also considered innocent. Why deny life to something that does not deserve such a fate?",0,2
472,"""Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.""   This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.   ""However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.""   This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.   ""Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.""   What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.   You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.   ""Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.""   The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference.    ""It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body.""   Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.      ""you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.""   And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.   ""Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life""   When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).",0,2

You keep making counter-arguments based on examples outside of what I am referring to. I am not talking about  any  zygote. We could argue in circles all year with various banter to this degree.  I am referring to the specific zygote that results from the fertilization event after intercourse, between two human beings.  I'm not talking about an animal or genetically engineered cells or whatever crazy outlandish example that you keep pulling out of your arse.   ""Consequences of a truth do not make the truth any less correct. Humans are defined by their ability to think, reason, and learn; they are defined by a culture spanning tens of thousands of years. Homo sapiens sapiens is defined by genetic relationship. Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).""   Correction: fully grown humans are defined by that. Those humans had to go through a growing stage before they gained all of the abilities that you mentioned. During that growth, they are not fully grown but are still human life.   ""You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.""   I am not concerned with it because the premise of my argument is indifferent with relation to the law. I am strictly dealing with morality. It use to be legal to own people. Thank goodness people didn't take the position that you are taking.   ""Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.""   You still have failed to disprove what I said. We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware. The exact moment of self-awareness is extremely important if you want to prove your argument, but you simply cannot do so. You wrote a check that your mind couldn't cash.   ""You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life. ""  Sure it matters. One method is natural and another method is unnatural. I don't advocate human cloning either, even though that could result in more human life.   ""It has no brains.

""  I never said anything about the zygote having a soul. My position is that it is human life, therefore to end that life at any point should be considered murder.   I'm not concerned with you bizarre hypothetical that completely ignores that basis of which we have been debating on. At no point did I say sperm or a woman's eggs were human life. The conjoining of the 2 in a fertilization event which results in a zygote is human life.

Abortion involves fetuses and all the ""if it has nails it can feel pain"" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument ""we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance"" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than ""a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain"".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child. But they never say that, why?, because they would die alone. The way I see this debate, one side is blinly screaming ""somebody please think of the children"" and the other side is blindly screaming ""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to"".   Before you devote your lives to ridding the world of fetal pain, deal with the torture that is being carried out uncontested (even though it's often pulbicized=general knowledge), deal with the female genital mutilation, deal with the starving children, deal with the raped children, deal with the unwanted, beaten, emotionally damaged, forgotten, slave children that are a result of poor parental planning you backwards thinking, self-proclaimed advanced specie intellectuals who have nothing better to do than trivialize the pain that exists in this world.",0,1

For Christians who are all pro-life you need to remember that according to your faith God knew what that girl was going to do when he put that baby in her belly. He put it there anyway. If we take that girls right away to choose for herself girls will be choosing life because they were forced to not because they chose that it was the right thing to do. You are eliminating an opportunity for her to find God by making that decision on her own.,0,1

511,"This question has far greater implications. Are there such things as inalienable rights - human rights? The right to life for example? If there are, then there are two possibilites:  1. Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being. From the moment of conception, a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such, with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being.  2. We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.  As abortion does not affirm to my vision of what an ethical, civilized nation should be like - I'm forced to subscribe to the pro-life position.",0,2
512,"Does it not go against all reason that person A should have the right to kill person B, if person A finds person B's continued existence to be inconvenient?  A woman may have a right to her body, but by choosing abortion she's affecting the rights of another persons body as well - the child's.   And mental trauma from the abortion is no fitting punishment for murder. We don't let people freely walk away from unwillingly killing other people just because they feel bad about it.",0,2
513,"A women should be able to choose what happens with her body, especially concerning abortion and babies.  Not because I support abortion, but what if you were the child of a mom?  What if that mom only had you grudgingly because she was forced to have you, abortions being outlawed?  Would you really want to grow up unloved? A child who's own mother would have aborted you?   Worse than an accident, you are a person whom the people you are supposed to love, and are supposed to love you would rather have had you dead than given birth to you.  In reality, it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel, and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more? Why go to the trouble and the pain for the mother, and the child, the entire family, and the whole world, when abortion could be an option?  I support safe sex and planned pregnancy, I think abortion is murder, as is war or any human killing another human, but killing does happen. Every time you eat, you are eating something that was killed, plant or animal.  If it reduces pain in the world, then you should be able to abort.",0,1

That is why I must be pro-life AND pro-choice. I cannot force others to my opinion, just as others cannot force me, because it is only an opinion.   Normally, I am against killing, but a fetus is a lot different than a fully grown human, or even a child.

531,"There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.  Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.   Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.   The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.",1,2
532,Of all the arguments I have made about this issue I think it comes down to this simple fact; Abortion should be banned because the most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.  I say this because statistically speaking more human beings are killed there everyday than anywhere else. That in my opinion simply should not be.,1,2
533,"I would like to offer some clarification on the question ""can I kill it"" and the follow-up question ""what is it""  As I have stated before; the taking of human life requires a high level of justification. No argument that I've seen for abortion rises to the level of proper justification. Please note what I'm discussing; the taking of human life, not any life but human life in particular.   So what does that have to do with the question ""can I kill it"" That question needs to be clarified; hence the follow up question. What I want you to notice is what kind of question ""what is it"" is. It is an ontological question. We're asking about the very nature of the thing in question. And that's important because it determines how we answer the first question. But notice this is a strictly ontological question; it is not a question about level of dependence or development. Why is that important? Because if the thing in question, ontologically speaking, is human then it requires a high level of justification to kill it. If it's not human, no justification is necessary. I'm not saying if it's human you can't kill it, sometimes you can and must but you must properly justify your actions. This is were abortion fails because the only reason it gives for the most part is because the mother just choose to. And yes I'm sure she went through some tough decisions but bottom line; she wants to. Because the fact is she doesn't have to; she has other options.   But what happens when you kill without proper justification? You have to find a way to justify the act because your conscience is smitting you. This is always done by making the victim less than human or not human at all. Because after all if it's not human, no justification is necessary. And this is were I have seen all the arguments for abortion go. They leave the ontological question and move to other areas that are more easily justifiable. Most of them are framed like this:  can I kill it? What is it? it's just a..... Well of course you can  They all answer yes by qualifying the object by something that is easier to justify; a standard that is lower not higher. But let's answer the question head on and notice how the gravity of the question changes when we answer the follow-up question correctly. And by correctly I mean answering the question according to the kind of question it is, an ontological question.  can I kill it? What is it? It's a human, one at the very early stages of it's development......   So let's take the question of this debate head on; Should abortion be banned?   What is abortion?   The taking of a human life at the very early stages of it's development.   Why would you want to do that?   Because I don't want the inconvenience of a child.  Does that sound like proper justification for the taking of human life, especially the weakest and most vulnerable human life?  I have reduced, intentionally, all reasons for an abortion to a matter of convenience because ultimately that's what it comes down to. If a pregnancy, regardless of how it came about, stands between you and what you want it's an inconvenience; and we all know what we do with inconveniences. But this one is a little sticker because it's human. But if we can take away or cloud it's humanity then it will be easier to do.   So should abortion be banned? Of course it should, for obvious reasons.",1,2
534,I agree with you except on the issue of rape. Why should the child be killed for a crime they didn't commit?,1,2
535,"So let me see if I understand you. Killing children isn't actually wrong. It is only if you believe it is. So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was. And it would be good, by your logic, to kill you so long as I believed it was right. Since when does right and wrong depend on what one believes? This is certainly not the view of right and wrong that Jesus of Nazareth held. To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.  About loving: To love someone means to seek the very best for them and protect them from what harms them, You can't say you love someone and then stand by when they are being harmed when it is within your power to do something. Humans in the early stages of life just happen to be your neighbor. Go back and read the passage on the Good Samaritan. Your position is the one the Pharisee took and the one Jesus condemned.  about judging: The passage of scripture were Jesus deals with judging doesn't condemn judging nor forbid it. It does condemn judging hypocritically however. It then goes on to say "" first remove the log from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers""   If judging is wrong for you? why did you judge what I wrote? are you saying that you are perfect and never sin? I guess you don't leave the judging to God do you.",1,1
536,"Lets see Hitler killed people. abortions kill people. Wow your right, no correlation at all, a true red herring.  Want to know what Jesus taught about abortion, right and wrong and judging people? Go get your Bible and knock off the dust because it would be wise to ask Him not me.  Final thought; We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God, all of us are going to prison for a long time for comic treason. And since the one we offended is infinite in worth, the debt we owe is infinite also. So consider what infinity minus 10 thousand is, infinity. That's how long it will take to pay the debt.   But that's not the question at hand is it; it's about abortion. And for that there is only one question; what's being killed? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. No one needs justification to remove a tumor do they? But if it's a human being killed in an abortion then no justification is adequate.  So if you think abortions shouldn't be banned, please tell me exactly what is being killed in an abortion,",1,1
537,"The funny thing is you say that I say a whole lot of things that I can't find in the things I write. Maybe you could help me out and tell me were I said such things like: ""Hitler was a murderer for having abortions""  ""You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours"". I said that?  ""Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?"" Were did i do that? I thought the question was; Should abortion be banned.   And help me with this one: ""We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.""  Who is judging someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?  Please show me were I said that.  Just for the record; my view is that everyone of us, apart from the grace of Jesus Christ, is hell bound for the high crime of cosmic treason, aka idolatry. Romans 1:18-25  Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  If I remember correctly you responded to a post I made quoting Greg Koukl who i thought made a very good point regarding the question of this debate and you responded with, you can't use that, it's Christian. How very judgmental of you.  Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches. I'll help you out. And note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here. That's an objective standard, not a subjective one as you suggest. And he says in the last passage that all men will be judged by this law. That means it applies to all men, at all times and in all places. that is the polar opposite of what you say.  So one of you has got to be wrong.  Matthew 19:17-19   17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”  18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”  Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”  Matthew 5:20   For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.",1,1
538,"You are correct in your assessment of me. Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there.   I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast. Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.  But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound? If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved. And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost. If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me.  “If you love Me, keep My commandments"" John 14:15   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

Using a condom is what you do before fertilization to try and prevent fertilization. An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization.

It's seems to me that if this issue of abortion is ""debatable"" then it would be unwise to throw open the gates of permission.

I think the guilt of that would have a more profound affect on our nation than thousands of women who die from back ally abortions.

Therefore no further questions are needed.  I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.  But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good.

551,"Ok let me clarify,But let me say I'm not sure why you are pushing this point, but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that.  So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.   In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.   So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas. And the Husband and Wife should make the call, if circumstances necessitate it.",1,1

But in this day and age with 3D and 4D imagining it is simply naive.   But let's say your right and we don't know at what point the unborn embryo/fetus gains the rights of a full grown person. Why not err on the side of life? If we don't know it would seem wise to use caution and restraint. Therefore to allow abortion on demand would be the height of folly.  So in conclusion; if we don't know when a fetus becomes a person we should ban abortion because it might take the life of a person.",1,2
553,"Yes I do, because I think clarity is more important than agreement and I'm trying to be precise in my thinking. I don't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates. I ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of. Asking the question of personhood doesn't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is. They tell us something about the thing but they don't tell us what the thing in question is. To know that requires an ontological question and that's why I ask; what is it? And you are correct, it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood, assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is. And humans are the sort of things that have personhood; it's not what they are but a characteristic they posses.  Now I think the question, what is it, is one you would ask instinctively. What do I mean. Assuming you have a child, what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked; can I kill it? I'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be; what is it? And if it was the fly that's been bugging you, you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no. You see your answer hinges on the question; what is it and no other question. I hope you can see that. And the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know, instinctively, that humans aren't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly, it requires proper justification. That's why I oppose abortion. Killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil.   BTW insult is not an argument, it's what you do when your position is unsound. You try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good. But notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand, it has no bearing on it. That my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an Ad hominem. You don't actually answer the question, you just obscure it and that's the opposite of clarity.",1,2
554,"About Ad hominem, Let's say all the nasty things about me are true and much worse. What does that tell us about my claim? nothing. It only says something about me and is therefore irrelevant to the question at hand. So what if I'm logically unsound and have obvious character weaknesses? does that mean I'm therefore incapable of saying anything truthful? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. So to say because of this therefore that I think is a a non sequitur. And since recycling is a good thing I'll say it again. Insult is not an argument, it's a failure to provide one. Now your free to use them if you like but they don’t carry much weight with me; I really am much worse than you think.   Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species.   If that is true, then you are mistaken when you said  Killing a grown kid is murder  Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society. But who decides what is good for the species, how do you define good, good for who?  But to my question ""can I kill it"" Your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done. You recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong. And that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it. Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good. You know that and so do I. But if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us. It is objectively wrong.   And further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained? Because in your scheme it could have been otherwise. In your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong. Because if your correct, like I’ve said, we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing. But when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong. And we know it’s wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates. And your definition of that good ( survival of the human species) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction. Because If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the... We don't make laws to make things wrong, we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong, they are wrong in and of themselves, like murder, theft and disrespecting people; especially our elders.   But what I think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development. Notice how you use the phrase “grown kid” So I ask you what’s the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park? Level of development. The terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case. So when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception, 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong, that’s called moral clarity. That’s why the question “can I kill it” is so clarifying. It’s the last word, it, that makes all the difference. What is it, is an ontological question. I’m not asking the question, what’s its stage of development. That would be absurd to answer the question that way. You would never answer your kid that way. Hey daddy, can I kill it? Well son, how old is it, you know the younger the better. But that’s how you try and answer the question of abortion. I keep asking, what is it that we are killing? And you keep telling me how old it is, well it’s just at the fetus stage. OK, so what is it? And like I’ve said before; a question not properly answered doesn’t go away, it keeps getting asked. So I will keep asking the question, what is it? Till I get an adequate answer. But honestly you know as well as I do what it is and the only reason you would answer differently is if you were trying to justify something that you instinctively know to be wrong.      Final thought on showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgments. You said;  the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership.   This statement from you destroys your whole argument. If this is true, why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.",1,2
555,"Thank you for making my point so well, you are correct. Taking human life requires proper justification. However waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification. It's a unique human life and there is no way around that without ignoring the obvious. Declaring it to be something else and equivocating on terms may salve your conscience but it doesn't change the reality of what it is. It's reality is not dependent on you, it's determined by what it actually is.  If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor",1,2
556,Saying something is proper justification doesn't make it so. You first have to prove that it is and that you haven't done. You've only dismissed it's humanity. . If it is only a sperm or egg it is indeed alive but not fully human seeing it lacks the full chromosome set. But once it fertilizes and the chromosome set is complete; it's fully human. Either it's fully human and alive or it's not. I don't see any other option and the potential life argument doesn't factor in at all.  Again we are talking about the proper justification of taking human life; rabbit trails don't interest me.  About hassling; I will defend the innocent at my own expense; even if it cost my life because that's the right thing to do and it's always right to do what is right.,1,2
557,"I've just responded to this notion of potential life so I will answer your questionin in regard to respecting your point of view.   Your are free to hold it. Although I disagree with it strongly I would never use the force of law or anything to prevent you from holding it and expressing it, that is true tolerance.   However, ideas have consequences and some ideas are deadly. So I would say that some ideas are vastly superior to others. What Mother Teresa did was a superior idea than what jihadist are doing. But jihadist are human and therefore are valuable human beings worthy of dignity and respect. So as humans I respect them but it's their ideas that I don't respect. So all that to say that I'm egalitarian regarding persons and an elitist regarding ideas. So as a human I will treat you with dignity and respect but I can't say I will do that with all your ideas, only the ones that are good by objective standards.",1,1
558,And I will further say that since I'm egalitarian regarding persons I will not engage in ad hominem because it is at the man. I will go after your ideas with a vengeance however because i differentiate between the person and their ideas.,1,2
559,"FYI an embryo is a stage of life it's not the thing. Your argument therefore falters because of equivocation. And furthermore person hood is a characteristic of the thing, not the thing.   And finally, I don't discriminate against humans; it's just plain wrong. All humans, especially ones in the early stages of development, are worthy of or full protection. That's called moral clarity.",1,2
560,"Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged. And I will wear that label with honor.  But tell me why you think no one likes getting an abortion, and why everyone would be happier if there were less abortions.     And about that ""clump of cells"" are they cancer cells? if not, what kind of cells are they?  Finally,   In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.   True, however life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guarantied to all of them expect those in the early stages of development, those in their mothers womb. That's discrimination based on level of development and that's just plain wrong. The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb",1,2
561,"Looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity. Somethings are obviously wrong like theft, rape and murder. To say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious. Now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act. Not a place I want to go.   Of course no one wants to get an abortion   If that were true no one would get an abortion. People get abortions because they want to.  In regards to ""feel something"" and ""the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes"" You seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion, a suffering that last a life time. That suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant. That's the suffering I want to end. Not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead Nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks. It's called The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   Because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those. Adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that's exactly what your standard does. You ought to be protecting the weak and innocent, not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing. For example you said  a viable fetus should be considered a full human being . So those that are not, are not human? You've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them, I'm sorry but that's not proper justification. I do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through. All I have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then I'm free to kill you; might makes right.   That's why abortion should be banned, because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human. If we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it's head because laws are meant to protect people. But who is a person is subject to the opinion of another. I don't know about you but I never would want to be treated like that.",1,2
562,"To your first point:  What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life. This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Life_unworthy_of_life    Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.  In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book   From Darwin to Hitler  by Dr. Richard Weikart  Now to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?  At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs.   About a contraception that is 100% effective every time. It's known as abstinence. Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD. Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's.   And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them. It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash. There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it. You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they? There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.  You noted well that I see this issue as black and white. It's called moral clarity. When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil.   Final thought: Were you ever a fetus? Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life. Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.  And if you were born after 1972, I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust. 1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America!    http://www.survivors.la/",1,2
563,"Well, if you have a lame duck congress who stonewalls him on everything; I think it would be reasonable to blame them.  But that's not the question at hand is it? The question is; what is being killed in an abortion? that's the only one that matters.",1,2
564,"You say;  There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.  But to answer your question about the role of government in these affairs please consider the following:   ""We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""   Taking the life of another person is an injustice, destroys domestic tranquility, destroys general welfare and robs the individual of the blessings of liberty, If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?  This is how our Founding Fathers saw it:   ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness""  Please note the use of the word ""all"" The decision handed down in Roe vs Wade stripped a whole class of people their rights by denying their humanity.  This ruling goes against the very Constitution itself; It is a disgrace. As I said earlier it turns the law on it's head, the very law it is supposed to uphold.   It appears this court has become destructive of the purpose for which it was founded and according to the Deceleration of Independence it is our duty to do something about.",1,2
565,"That scenario of the endangered mother is rare. The vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children. You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.  The right to life is  the  most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue. When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.  In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion. And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust. I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.  In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.  This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere. This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I. Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.      Just consider that 1/3 of our population has been exterminated since Roe vs Wade. Do you think that has an affect on Social Security now that there are more people drawing from it than paying into it. What of the effects on health care? How many doctors and scientist were exterminated",1,2
566,"Let me address the point you are making here:   that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?   If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion? And if I'm a doctor I have more of a right to do what I want? Don't you think this goes against one of the reasons for licensing doctors, public safety? Again I say; If a government has not right to protect life, what good is it.  On the issue of the death penalty. The principal in play for me on this issue and abortion is the same; the sanctity of human life.",1,2
567,"The question is not about person-hood, but humanity and that is genetically verifiable. Answer the question, what kind of being is it? Everything else is superfluous.  And just so you know what side you stand on; your argument is similar to those who supported slavery,  they are not full persons and therefore have no rights under the law .  So let me qoute you using the word slavery in place of fetus and maybe you can see where you went wrong   Nothing about the right to slavery is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a slave is not a person.    Never in the history of U.S. law has a slave been a ""person,"" and a slave is not a ""person"" under the law of Britain either.  A slave is property and therefore one can do with it as one sees fit.",1,2
568,"FYI  The question is not who did or didn't do this or that. The question is should abortion be banned. I say it already is. We already have laws against murder; it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual. Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution.   Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong. And if it is within in your power to stop it and you don't; you are just as guilty, regardless of your political affiliation.",1,2
569,"A clump of cells is not what is aborted, do your research first. But let's say they are for the sake of the argument; what kind of cells are they? chicken? no they are human.  On the issue of dependency: you are wholly dependent on other living beings for your existence. By your logic it would be OK to kill you if the issue of dependency was all that was needed to justify your death. And further more we could extend this to the mentally and physically handicapped. It could apply to the sick and suffering, people with cancer and all those in hospitals. The logic you use is exactly the logic the Third Reich used when it began doing these very things; long before it got to exterminating 6 million Jews.  You may agree with the Third Reich that there is such thing as a life unworthy of life, but I don't. A child conceived is worthy of life and should have every opportunity to live it.",1,2
570,"I'm questioning the underlying principle in play here and there is a connection between all the examples I gave. if you can't see the underlying principle here I don't know what to tell you.   The argument looks like this:  X is not worthy of life because of Y, therefore we're justified in killing it.  Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of ""X"" and put your reason in place of ""Y"" and you've got your argument.  Can you see the analogy between them now? So my principal objection is with the ""Y"" when you have an embryo for ""X""",1,2
571,"Notice what you have done; You've imposed an arbitrary standard (dependent on the womb of another) and then said it is OK to kill any human being who doesn't meet this standard. That standard can be slid anywhere up or down, from conception to old age. It's what is know as moral relativism and it's a morally bankrupt ethic. The question is not; at what point can we kill it, but what is  it ?  You need to first establish that this standard of yours is morally justified because I'm not persuaded that it is.",1,2
572,"I'd like add a different perspective to your argument. I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.   The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.   Hope that clears things up for you.",1,2
573,"Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing   Never said it was, only the logic behind it. Here is an example:   It is the mother's property   FYI that's the same logic that was used to justify the beating of slaves; it was the slave master's property.   You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself.     That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency. Should I discriminate against you because you are dependent on the local grocery store to get your milk? I think not, that would be wrong.  And finally, did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.",1,1
574,"Somebody flunked biology didn't they? No, I'm sure you didn't which tells me something else motivates your avoidance of the obvious.",1,2
575,"Here is what I think you are saying by potential life; This human after a certain point can go on and have a life. And by life I'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense, meaning the totality of ones existence, a life lived.   Here is why I think that is a dangerous position to hold. Basing the value of a human on it's potential is a subjective value judgment, someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life. If someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it. That's dangerous because that is how Germany began the road to the holocaust. It started with the sick, mentally retarded and elderly. The did it by making the value judgment that certain humans didn't have potential, they held no value for society. And following Darwin's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them. See potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways, it's what's know as an equivocal word.   You see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk, even you.   The safer ground to stand on is objective value. The value of the human is in the human itself. By the fact that it is human gives it it's value. This puts all humans on a level playing field. I can't come up to you and because I have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine. Taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race. We are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful.   I hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful. And now because of your power over them you can kill them freely, this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans. Conscience ought to tell you that we should protect them, not exploit them.",1,2

If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain. And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection? No. Made it rare? most certainly. And what happened after Roe vs Wade? abortions went through the roof. Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite. it sanctions it.   Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group. Why? Zero Population growth. They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it. Europe will be a Muslim nation within our lifetime, Why? They're having families.   So please tell me why we should follow the Europeans into extinction?",1,2

If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being.

About killing your neighbor; So long as he is not fully grown I can kill him?

Yeah right. Try that in a court of law.  Why do you think we should reduce the number of abortions? Is it because you know in your heart of heart that it takes the life of a human being in the early stages of development?  We are drowning in a sea of condoms and sex ed and it has increased the rate of abortion, not decreased it. Abstinence has not been tried and found wanting, but found hard and left untried. Come on let's set high standards for ourselves and our kids, not low ones.",1,2
585,"It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed. A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference. I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.  About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.  about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.  Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems. And perfection is never a requirement for law. it's meant to reduce the numbers. Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will.",1,2
586,"Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?    I never said it's sole purpose was procreation. The core question is one of anthropology; does man have a nature and is that nature fixed? You would apparently say no and that man gets to define that nature. Laws should be based on ethics, not morality. However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality. Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from. Everything becomes a matter of personal preference and taste. Everyone does what is right in their own eyes. That is anarchy and society crumbles.  Second paragraph: Never said there was no pleasure in it; just that their was a cost that is hidden from your eyes. I could never get you to drink poison if I was upfront about the effects. But if I kept that information from you and packaged it good enough; it wouldn't be hard Case in point; homosexuality. harmless? The average life expectancy for a gay male is 45yrs almost half of heterosexual males. There really needs to be more truth in advertising for the sexual revolution. It has brought freedom to no one; only bondage.  Third paragraph: We get back to the real question don't we? What is it ? If it's not human than no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is sufficient. About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex. That troublesome problem of procreation again.  Fourth paragraph; there is that question again; what is it? just a group of cells or a human being in the early stages of life. If it's human, it's murder. hence the parallel.  Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions. The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children. About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what? there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country. that's why most couples adopt from overseas.  Sixth paragraph. If perfection is your standard then yes prohibition doesn't work. Prohibition does work, that's what every law is, a prohibition. It's sounds like you are arguing again for anarchy. To that I say; truth in advertising please.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex""  Really, you just substantiated my previous claim to being numb. Sex is used to sell everything these days. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.  About the choice and sex ed. I'd rather we told the kids the true cost of premarital sex. instead of lie to them. Oh yeah little Johny you can play with fire, just follow these simple steps and you'll be just fine and hey here is some firecrackers to make it more fun. Now let me show you how to make a really cool fire using gasoline. Come on! Let's help kids choose what is best for them, and it's not broken hearts, STDs, single motherhood and the whole list of other stuff that goes along with it. About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns. A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest. Don't believe me. Watch the interview Dr. Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution. I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:  Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy. How did you get here?  Ted Bundy: Pornography. I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied. The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it. Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.  About the study; I don't dispute it. Of course it's failing that's my point. It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain. I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.  Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine. Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be. But that's just your personal preference isn't. If you really believed that morality was subjective you would go sit under a tree and talk to no one, but you don't. You try and persuade people that your view is the correct one, but why I ask?",1,2
587,"Well we've covered a lot of ground. Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.  What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common? What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together? They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is. You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed. Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function. A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing. Let me explain.  Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Homosexuality: An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.     Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.  Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Do you see the pattern. reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them. At the core of everyone of these is love of self. Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.  Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all? It does me. That's why I oppose all these things.  Final thoughts:  football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game. There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.  Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is. Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with. Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.  Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind.   If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back. Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to. That leads to depression and eventually suicide. That's not a very loving thing to do.  On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do.   About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right. But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?  I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed. After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states. Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it. And that is wrong.  About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about. The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be. Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy.   So again the question on abortion is; what is it? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is adequate.   So I say, it ain't a chicken. Humans produce humans. Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.  Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance.",1,2
588,"OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?  I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.  Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.  I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.  What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy.   So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context.   But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.  So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons.   So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.",1,2
589,you're not arguing that abstinence doesn't provides 100% protection are you?,1,2
590,You lead by setting a higher standard. That's what leaders do; take people were the don't want to go. It takes no leadership on my part to get the family to go to Disneyland. It does how ever to get them to save through out the year so at Christmas time they have something to give to those less fortunate.,1,1
591,"Abstinence means to abstain. You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.  About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them. The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them. Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible. So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up. Hey kids will be kids, right? Come on. Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.  Also, giving condoms is giving permission. You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear. Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it. What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem. I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.  Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them. Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance. So, lets expect more out of kids and not less.",1,2
592,"You don't nor should you. The government should remain neutral on this issue. It's the parent's responsibility, not the state's. We need to get sex ed out of public schools and give the choice of sex ed back to the parents were it belongs. And may the best idea win.",1,1
593,"Yes, I do. that's the problem. Why not strive for the ideal instead of settle for something less.",1,2
594,"Guess it depends on who's study you read and how they ask the questions. The CDC tells a different story. STD means sexually transmitted and if your not having sex (any kind of sexual contact) you're not transmitting; It's that simple. Ask the CDC what they do in an outbreak, quarantine. Why do hospitals not allow children visitors during flu season? Why are you advised to stay at home when sick? Please tell me why this approach works for all diseases except sexually transmitted ones?",1,2
595,"Yeah, that makes sense. Let's kill the kid for a crime they didn't commit. Thanks for clearing that up for me.   But please tell me why you think death is preferable to life?",1,2
596,"So you would say that it is better that 45 million + children die through abortion than a handful of women through a botched abortion. That doesn't sound like progress to me: That sounds like serious moral confusion. Go check out the stats on abortion rates through out the years and you will see a staggering peak after Roe vs Wade.  And yes, we would still have abortions, they would just be a whole lot fewer of them. Again, check out the stats on abortion rates before and after Roe vs Wade.",1,2
597,"it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body.   Then why does it have it's own unique DNA? And what's the point of the fetal sack? Why all the complex systems to isolate the fetus from the mothers body? No serious doctor holds this position; the data doesn't remotely support it.   Once it reaches the stage   I did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life. You just said it right there. And here is a list of all the words you use in making this distinction; Until, Once, then, before.  And about this notion of ""potential life!"" by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout, potentiality is a farce.  And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hood? You see I don't discriminate; If it's human, and it is, then it deserves our full protection. The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.",1,2
598,You are correct about the double homicide law; however the contradiction is inherent in the ruling itself. The double homicide law was only raised to illustrate this. In fact I would argue that the law (double homicide) came to be because of the contradiction.   You might be correct about overturning the ruling. It might take another case challenging this ruling and it's constitutionality.,1,2

600,"I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.  First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions. This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience. But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it. The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.  The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is. It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable. So my effort is to make that know as best I can. But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed. So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible. There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His. When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled. Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account. So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness. And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.  This is only possible through repentance and faith. Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ. This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers. It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.  With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question  should abortion be banned . But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer. I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion. There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed. There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles. So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.   The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.    Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification. therefore it is murder and should be illegal",1,2
601,I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is:  abortion takes the life of an innocent human being  That' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it? And genetically it is human. It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it.   Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.,1,2
602,"OK agreed you have to establish intent. However, all abortions are premeditated, what say you?   Your assumption of my answer would be false, see my other response for the answer.  However to your point,you plain old sloppy thinker you, My qualification was:  without proper justification  and in this case it could be argued as proper justification.  However, the point of my syllogism was to highlight the importance of the question:  what kind of life is it  your objection highlights the point more becuse there would be no moral dilemma if it was a chicken.",1,1
603,"It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.   That's called discrimination based on level of dependency. It would seem to be the more compassionate thing to protect humans who are more dependent on others for their existence. You protect the weak, not exploit or kill them.   It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call ""potential"" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a ""a clever rhetorical trick"" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day? I hope your kidding because of course it would. That's why we ban things, to stop them. And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.   your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.   Well, let's see. Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead. And that death came by willful intent, not an accident. In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide. But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK, right ? I don't think so. Call it what you will but a duck by any other name is still a duck.",1,2
604,Thank you for your testimony. I'm so glad you spoke up and would strongly encourage you to do it more often. Apart from rape your case is the most often used justification for abortion. And as your existence proves it is not proper justification. I know of a woman ( I can't remember her name) but her mother was rapped. I know of her because she is doing public speaking on this issue of abortion.  You are a testimony to the fact the abortion snuffs out a human life because it would have taken yours.

He has to look after the child, so he has the choice to do it or not. You are responsible for this child whether he wants to babysit or not.",1,1

Only she should have the say in whether it should be kept or not.

Abortion isn't a form of birth control like condoms or the pill, for those directly involved it's a difficult choice that they have to make because bringing a human life up is no easy task. It's not like having a pet (and even that is a big ask because not all pet owners are responsible).  Again, it's the choice of those directly involved.

It scares me that people like you could be in parliament affecting lots of lives. Here's why:  You say ""abortion is a problem, not a solution"" - ummm this is YOUR VIEW. My view is that it's NOT a problem but a RESULT of unwanted pregnancies (which is the real problem (and you admit this in the next couple of sentences.

Ok I'm not going to chew your ""making a law on abstinence"" to pieces, it's essentially dealing with the problem of unwanted pregnancies. We may have some common ground here. I've actually moved past the ""banning unprotected sex"" arguments to now suggest ""making unwanted pregnancies expensive and coupling it with something rehabilitative like a compulsory education on the whole thing.""  The problem of rape has already been dealt with. It's called ILLEGAL and includes a jail term. No need to discuss that here.  Banning abortion wouldn't be necessary if you're actually dealing with the problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. So you say that you're not one who push their belief on others and that you're ""educative"". Then you should stop calling for a ban on abortion.

You may have all the hearts to be a great debater, but that's all you've got at the moment.  If you believe that this topic demands the ""thoughts"" and ""feelings"" of people, not on statistics and logics, how then will you convince legislators to make laws for your cause?

As a potential, it is in the same class as a single egg or sperm. Of course, once birthed the child still has no guarantee of life due to SIDS, diseases, etc... but at least it has a better chance of survival. So, before the period of 20 weeks, it has no chance of survival outside of the womb, so the woman should have the choice of keeping it or not.",1,1

634,"This argument has already been covered, so I don't know why you're repeating it. But since you have, i will reply again:  Protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place. You're preventing fertilization from happening, some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed, neither should abortion.  I get you're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex, so what you should argue for is that UNPROTECTED SEX SHOULD BE BANNED, not abortion should be banned! Abortion is dealing with the aftermath, so let it be dealt with! If you want to PREVENT, then outlaw UNPROTECTED SEX. Make it illegal! Just like riding a bike without a helmet! It's illegal to ride bikes without helmets (at least in some countries).",1,1
635,"You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?  Just compare it with many other things that are illegal: riding a bike without helmet, not wearing a seatbelt in a car. Most of the time, the cops don't know if you're wearing your seatbelt or not! But they certainly would know if you crashed your car!!! So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!! Then you'd be fined lots of money, or the fine should be built into the cost of an abortion!!! That should be a deterent, wouldn't you say? Eventually people will learn that it's not good to have unprotected sex, they won't have to be told any more. Like wearing a seatbelt in a car, it's become second nature to people now.  ""Promoting childbirth""? I'm sorry but this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population? That's just dictatorship, pure and simple.

You're contradicting your own points, so just leave it and relax your views a little bit.   You also agree that we should educate to prevent mistakes from occuring. That's already happening so we're not arguing about that.  You say it's too late to find out about an illegal activity after the consequences? How else can you find out about an illegal activity? Something must happen to bring it to the authorities' attention, duh! How does anyone know if you're wearing your seatbelt when you drive? They don't!!!!

653,"I fully support this view.  In my personal opinion, once the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb (which means society can theoretically take care of the baby without the mother's input) then society can intervene.

So the 2 sides disagree on whether abortions should be banned, which means each to its own: This essentially means pro-lifers can go on having children (regardless of whether they want them or not). Pro-choicers can go on having abortions as an option. Each to its own! To make a law in any democratic society, the majority must agree, if you don't have a majority, then the law will not pass, so the status quo is abortions CANNOT BE MADE ILLEGAL.. get it?

First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.   Secondly, we don't even need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it. It's not as if the world's population is dwindling, we actually don't need any more unwanted babies coming into this world! We've got enough of the babies that are actually wanted and we also have enough of those who aren't wanted and have become a burden on society because of their natural tendencies to commit crimes, so if you want to save actual lives and not potential lives, then make wars illegal, make climbing Mt.

Don't try and force me to have children when I don't want to. They're fetuses. I make them and I can break them and make some more, it's a difficult decision when I have to abort them, but when I'm ready to have children I will have children, not when you think I'm ready. It makes no difference to your life, but it has a massive impact on mine so don't butt in! Women who've had abortions have gone on to have children later on when they're ready.  You claim to represent mothers who've chosen to keep their babies - good for you, but here's a news flash: they don't actually need you to represent them! They don't need you to argue that they should be allowed to keep their babies, nobody's trying to stop them! So it's a great position of risk that you've placed yourself in. A very challenging role!

By doing that, you're showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgements.  Now, I think I've read this story of the boy coming up to his father and asking ""can I kill it?""... why? It's because you've written it already in a different post! Recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons, but i find it tedious here. Now I've already answered this but i'll gladly do it again: Killing a grown kid is murder! Why did society make a law to try and stop murders? Because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing! Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species. Don't believe me? Thou shall not kill... thou shall not steal... thou shall honour thy parents... etc... all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species.  Now, a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development, which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high. That kid has earned its right to be a part of society. Killing that kid is wrong. A fetus on the other hand, can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too. The point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership. This is the way it should be. Maybe one day, we'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what? I bet there'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal! That's why societies make law. If it has nothing to do with the survival of society, society should stay out of it.",1,1
671,"Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society.   We have executions. We execute murderers. These are actually not kids but adults. So we do kill people and I fully support it.  .   Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good   Well, arbitrarily exterminating a race of people goes against human survival.   .   If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the...   You're absolutely right. But you fail to see that our  gut reaction  is our subconsciousness and in its own language, it's saying ""hey, survival of the species is at stake here!""  .   Level of development   You're exceptionally thick, so I'm not hoping to get through to you at all. I'm simply hoping you'd one day wake up... How is a fetus not the same as person in the park? Well let's see... if the mother suffers a heavy fall or gets a bad virus, the fetus may well be naturally aborted and may no longer be, hell, sometimes it simply takes a little bit of stress felt by the mother for the fetus to be aborted naturally. A person in the park however, takes a hell of a lot more to end.  .   why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.   Yes, human lives are valuable, but like I said, we're in no danger of extinction. All these measures such as laws against murder, hospitals, national health care, etc... are preliminary steps.

This means she alone should have the choice. You should not butt in just because of your own feelings. Consider other people's feelings, consider the people who are directly affected by this. They should have the choice to keep the pregnancy or not before it turns 20 weeks. If you can't keep it, then butt out!

It's really quite workable:  Ok, what I mean is make ""sex that results in an unwanted pregnancy"" illegal. Ok, unwanted pregnancy is the key. Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury. You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT. If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!!!! A hefty fine is a very good deterent. You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion. This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive. The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc... You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.  So, as with seatbelt wearing in a car, over a short period, people would all learn to do it responsibly and it will become second nature and not have to be such an issue. Don't make it illegal, regulate it and everyone's a winner.",1,1

It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. It has more educational value then a ban on abortion. Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child. Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?  The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work.

Abortion is also not the taking of a human life. It's the prevention of a human life, same as having sex with a condom, using the pills, abstinence, etc...

685,Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing. It's an entirely different debate.  A fetus that's not capable of survival without being directly attached to its mother via the umbilical cord is still not yet a person that merits society's involvement. It is the mother's property until this point and she must have the choice of keeping it or not. You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself. If you can keep the baby alive with milk then by all means take it out and do that if you want. The mother doesn't have to be involved any more.,1,1
686,"The fetus  really  is the mother's property naturally (she created it and didn't have to buy it from anyone) , whereas the slave is bought or forced to be his/her owner's property.

The fetus is either  completely  dependent on its mother, or is  completely not  dependent. After a certain period of development, an incubator and some formula could totally replace its mother.  As for me and the local grocery store, I won't die if the local store refuses to serve me.  .   ...did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.

Disgust can be evoked without visual stimulus or having formed anything like an opinion. For example with extremely foul odors. An odor that is  in fact  disgusting to some, others may find that they can tolerate. The fact that some people build a tolerance and can endure without experiencing disgust doesn't make it any less factual that the smell is disgusting.   More than the thoughts of people actually faced with getting abortions?   If someone feels like they are ""faced with getting an abortion"" when they really aren't, perhaps thoughts like those I express will be considered more weighty than those expressed by people like you who as I see it are advocates of abortion as a form of birth control.   If by necessary, you mean something that logically follows and literally cannot be other way, then even your 'necessary' abortions are not necessary.   True, there are always other options, though they may not be immediately perceivable. I don't use the word necessary in such a manner as to retard recognition of the possibility of better options. Obviously earlier on some things were thought to be necessary that were later proven not to be.   After all, people can always 'choose' to let themselves die slow, painful deaths.   No they can't, not always. :)  Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   You already have. Unless you did actually mean necessary in the logical sense, you've decided 'necessary' means 'necessary to prevent the mother from suffering death or serious injury.'   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives. It's not that the alternatives don't exist, it's that they are not sought out with enough diligence. If you want to use logic so strict that it renders the use of the term ""necessary"" pointless, I'll have to agree that no medical procedures are necessary. You could however submit to common sense and realize I was referring to a determination of necessity made by a licensed medical professional.   Things that would make doctors hacks according to you:  Correcting birth defects such as extra fingers, tails, or deviated septa  Cosmetic reconstructive surgery for accident victims  All exploratory surgeries   Sorry, I left out ""improving"". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   Things that wouldn't:  Abortion (unless you can show me that pregnancy does not reduce the mother's health from its pre-pregnancy level, thus making abortion a procedure that restores health)   There are countless factors that come into play when considering the overall health of a person, and I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman. If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.",1,2
756,"I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like ""it will ruin your life"" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?",1,2
757,"I never made the claim that no one was able to view abortion without disgust. Heck some people can stand by while horrible things are done and not get the slightest bit upset. I need help because I'm failing to see where I've committed a logical fallacy. Break it down for me if you please. Treat me like a 3rd grade student.  I'll grant that an appeal to emotion isn't a rational way to demonstrate whether something is morally wrong or right, but frankly, I rather you but out unless you'd like to discuss how to (not just how not to)logically establish whether something is wrong or right.",1,2
758,"IMO people have a right to receive treatment from whomever they choose, without restrictive legislature, or an invasion of privacy.  Since opinions like mine are a distinct minority, and I don't expect radical change any time soon, I am stuck arguing for the improvement of the quality or justness of laws that address issues beyond what I consider to be the proper domain of public legislature in the first place.  Take as an example marriage. I don't like paying taxes for judges to hear cases about marriage, child support etc..  I did NOT say that abortion is a gross irreverence for life. I said ""The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive.""  I believe that there ARE cases where the decision to perform an abortion is made with the best interests of the mother in mind, and with fair consideration of her situation, and what can be accomplished with the doctors current skills. I believe abortion should be something a woman is..to paraphrase Zombee...""faced with"", not something she seeks out.  On the other hand....  I really don't think it's the business of government to disturb the privacy of doctor/patient relationships, or to make restrictive laws concerning an individual's choices for medical treatment. Such laws ARE in place however, so I'll talk about how I'd like them to change, since it appears they won't just go away.  I am pro-life in that I think abortion is an ugly thing that shouldn't be encouraged when it's clearly avoidable. I don't have to agree with the approach of outlawing abortion to identify as pro-life. Wanna know something sure to baffle you? I'm also Pro-Choice..  I don't fit your stereotype :)",1,2
759,"I'm not for making abortion illegal, but I am for legislation to discourage medical professionals from performing unnecessary medical procedures on pregnant women that result in the death of the developing fetus. So I will argue for Silaswash...since I guess he bailed.   people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.   It could be argued that it harms the public in general, by  1. Wasting valuable medical resources on unnecessary procedures  2. Encouraging indiscriminate sex  3. Promoting a culture of irresponsibility  It could mentally harm a father who had no choice but to bear the thought of his offspring being killed in it's most vulnerable state before it even had a chance.   fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible).   Moral agency! people don't get moral agency until they are old enough to experience regret. People who don't yet have moral agency still deserve legal protection.   The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents.   So how would you say a developing baby at the onset of the third trimester all of the sudden starts attributing value? Desperate attempts to justify the unnecessary killing of a fetus are invariably the result of such poor stretches of logic.   Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.    Morality applies any time an ugly and regrettable thing like an unnecessary abortion is performed.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.   So when do the father's rights to protect his developing child kick in?",1,1
760,"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery.   That we currently do is no argument that we ought to continue.   It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)   If you want to represent prenatal care or the rearing of a child as a waste of resources, I'll leave the untruth of that as self evident.   Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small.   I have a different hunch about these things than you, but I also suspect we can only contrast our opinions here sans any kind of statistical evidence.   Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people.   I don't think so.   A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences.   I am not arguing against the small fraction of abortions that are medically necessary.   There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.    I think I am, considering that most abortions are not by necessity but by choice.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body.   There is no legal basis to support the importance of a fathers right to protect his unborn child.   You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).    I could argue that a woman who willingly engages in the sort of sexual relations that commonly result in pregnancy should thereby confer certain legal rights to the father. It's the beginning of a shared responsibility so there should be shared commensurate rights. If a woman can legally compel a man to be held responsible after birth, he should have some legal say prior to.   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions.   No disagreement from me there.   Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established.   To the contrary...Living beings that don't meet your imaginary criteria, merit protection due to moral concerns. For instance if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents.   A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.  Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).    Having morality based reasons to protect a life form, does not depend on the life form in question being conscious. Even if you could give a logically sound explanation of what consciousness is.",1,1
761,"Honestly, your statement is both unintelligible and unintelligent.   No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it. If you think that being insulting is a fitting way to encourage in depth reasoning you are to say the least mistaken.   What are you saying here? Are you actually suggesting that the baby has a choice in the matter?   How in the world would you come up with that based on what he typed? Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion. Do a poll at the site and I bet most people would agree that YOU missed the OBVIOUS here in your rush to ridicule.   An unjustified assertion.   He did too justify it.

How can you say that I am rushing to ridicule when you haven't even seen my perspective on this issue?   Because you offered your scathing critique of Silaswash's writing style and left your response absent of anything that would give a clue as to your perspective regarding the subject being discussed.   You have claimed that abortion is an ""unnecessary"" surgery.   I didn't claim they all were.   You have also claimed that parents treat the life of their developing child like trash.

767,"Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple ""cluster of cells"" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it? Not convinced? Perhaps this example will help my point:  You are walking through a farm one day, and you stumble upon a chicken egg that has been freshly laid. You step on it, and guess what? You have commited murder!  I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside... yet! It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.  By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the ""potential bs,"" and how we should ""outlaw masterbation,"" is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid. Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male. So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation? I certainly wouldn't think billions, millions, or even several thousands!",1,2
768,"Ok.  You're now officially making ludicrous points. Congrats.  Gargantuous isn't even close to the word which is used to describe the difference between a sperm cell and an unborn fetus: A sperm cell has not yet entered the fertilisation process; a fetus has.  You said it yourself: There are thousands of sperm. There are also many eggs in a female. If you masterbate, it isn't the end of the sperm world! There are still going to be thousands upon thousands more and ready to be concieved! So please do not BS this debate and say that sperm = fetus, because it is completely wrong.  Lose a sperm cell, no big deal; lose a fetus, there is something to be concerned with.  No need to over-explain, your whole argument was wrong anyway.",1,2
769,"Well I'm sorry (not literally) that you feel so categorical towards the development of human life. Some of us, who actually believe in a reproduction with effort, look at a fetus AS HUMAN LIFE. While it may be a scrambled cluster of cells, it is already developing beyond the category of ""potential,"" regardless of self-awareness. Any scientist will tell you what reproduction means the world to the human race.  Maybe it's a parasite to you, but it's something completely different in the end isn't it?  Look, I don't care about all this BS with ""what is a child and what isn't,"" it isn't even the point of my argument.  My point is that a child cannot voice an opinion, and that sometimes, to prevent the worst, someone has to voice it for them. If we were all like you, saying that it should be completely up to the mother, then there'll be no need to second guess how the population will be affected.  For all you know, you could be aborting the next 'potential' President, or the next 'potential' anything! No-one can say how that'll change things, after all, the only means of comparison has just been scraped out of a woman's womb.  So Mr. Potential, have a nice day, and have a hard, long think about the 'potential life' that isn't even given the chance to survive!",1,2
770,"""You all keep telling us that it's murder!""   Murder is not the word that I would use.  I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.   Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue. By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child. So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.  Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference. We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion. Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.  In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is the  biggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!  Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands. And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that is  just plain stupid . The Government  can  have a say in education, but they  cannot  examine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex. It would be a full time job with prostitutes.

This topic demands what a person ""thinks"" and ""feels,"" not how he pulls out a statistic or two and calls a problem an ""effect.""

If you actually ""pieced"" my arguments together, you would actually notice that I am actually not calling for an immediate ban on abortions.

To think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options, such as setting their child up for an adoption, or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them. If I could 'personally' define the word 'abortion,' then it would be as follows:  'ABORTION: The term refers to the irrational decision to KILL the child before it has been birthed from the womb'  I am not going to sugar-coat abortions, because it's true, they are nothing short of murder! 'The children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that I have seen a few times in this debate (of course they have been worded differently, but again, I am not here to sugar-coat this sort of thing), and I can say that the mother/father has STOLEN the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them. They have also denied them of love, care, protection and most of all, they have denied them of a life.  As I have stated previously, I cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely! Surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them! But the second that an abortion begins, you have stripped that child of it's rights, and there is no way that you can ever make amends.   And no, I am not trying to send anyone on a guilt-trip, but I would be glad to know that some of you have come to realize what exactly an abortion does, and not just to think of the process as ""stabbing someone in the vagina.""",1,2

The fact that women consider an abortion as the first choice (or for that matter any choice) is too weak for some people, this includes me.  What individuals fail to see, and admit, is that there is always another option, whether it be putting the child up for adoption or to leave the child in the care of a friend or family member, so that the child has a life and it is still able to give a couple what they actually want.  People are so financial these days that they forget about human rights, something that a child deserves. We can all look at what science determines is a child and what isn't, but it is but some of us, who actually believe and support human life, will look as a fetus as a child, regardless of its understanding and capabilities.

The only exception that I could possibly see to this is with the case of rape, and this is only covers 1% of all abortions.

This is because we want to prevent children from coming into this Earth, or kill them off should accidents happen.""  This system is complete and utter BS, and would do more harm than good.  If we wanted to prevent children from being born, we should educate, and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples.

One man makes a difference, and yes, this can and does affect the world.  Man is the most dominant species on Earth, as I'm sure you would agree, and it is because of this that certain choices of ours greatly impacts the planet. Greenhouse gases is one example, Nuclear War is another. To be honest, there are many things I have done that have affected the world, all of which relate to Greenhouse Gas emissions and preventions.  Anyway, my point is that one man makes a difference, whether we are born or not makes a difference. The level of difference varies, as all men/women are not created equal.  It shouldn't be a choice of do we come into this world, but should be what we will do with the time we have while we are here.",1,2

Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?  Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite.

837,"During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945.

That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?  The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects. The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient. A child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient. I want you to tell me the Holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay. You just can't do that. One can't be wrong and the other right. That is like saying rape is wrong but incest is okay.",1,2
838,"“For You created my inmost being;You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child … And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth?   During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people.

To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?    Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.” In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.   Many pro-choice posters say “My Body. My Right.” Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Lord knew you, even before conception!    Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says “If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.”   But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound.   Luke 1:42-44 says “In a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.” When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said “Both Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ‘unplanned’ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is.",1,2

So that wouldn't be ""killing a child"" at all.  And don't start with the potential bs. Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing ""potential"" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.  ...

This is every time a guy cums. Look it up. There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep. But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.  And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the ""potential"" life argument is.  Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion. Because, exactly... like... I... said... we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.

And that is the dramatically flawed  potential  life argument.  The only argument pro-life has is that the cluster of cells is alive.  Okay fine, I'm through arguing that. You guys think you know more than science so obviously I'm not going to convince you otherwise.  What I  can  argue though is that  if  the tragedy here is the  potential  life lost. Then it is logically irrefutable that lost sperm is just as tragic.  Therefore, masturbation should be illegal, sex with your wife if she is barren should be illegal, sex if you're shooting blanks should be illegal, wet dreams should be illegal, etc.  Regardless of the numbers involved, a potential life is still a potential life.  So logically, if abortion is banned, so should (by pro-lifer logic even) all those things listed.  There's no way for you to escape that. Not that your arguments have ever been bound by logic thus far.",1,1
859,"great, another one.  I've read it. I've read it a million times on this lame debate alone. You're not saying anything new, there's no great revelation anywhere in your arguement.  None of what you say in any way points toward any kind of self-awareness. Science says it's not a baby, and nothing you said will stop a single abortion from happening.  So stop, find another cause. Abortions have been going on since the beginning of time and all this foaming-at-the-mouth zealous ignorance has never stopped a single one. Every time in history you zealous foaming-at-the-mouth looney tunes have gotten your way and made abortion illegal it has lead to nothing but a bunch of dead little girls from botched abortions, and still not a single abortion is ever stopped.  If  you  don't want an abortion,  you  don't have to get one. But if some poor young girl thinks that's her best option, then that's  her  choice.  If god or whoever doesn't like it, then he can come down here and tell her himself.  Stay out of it.",1,1

It doesn't matter what the thing  looks  like. Science tells us that thing is  not  yet a sentient being, therefore it  is not  killing a sentient being. Cute pictures does not = sound scientific reasoning.  You don't like abortion. Fine, don't have one, but that you  choose  not to believe the  fact  that at ten weeks that little thing has 0 sense of self, does not constitute any type of proof that abortion should be banned for those who choose to undergo it  before  that thing  is  sentient.  No one is for abortion once the child is self-aware. A self-aware human should not be aborted.  That is  not  a self-aware human, no matter how cute.   And that said, the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks.

Or the cluster of cells is removed and the woman dies. Either way, abortion being banned has never in human history stopped people from getting abortions.  2. No, it didn't make it rare, that's the point. Banning abortion doesn't stop it, it just hides it and demonizes woman, who many times are only children at the time, and who many times were raped.

Um, kids are self-aware, they just don't develop  empathy  until sometime after birth. But a new born has feelings, knows when it's hungry, etc. Therefore it's wrong to throw them in dumpsters.  3. True, and it's state to state. But even the states that do allow it up to birth, again it is only in extreme circumstances. If I'm a woman in  any  state and I'm due in a week, and my life is not in danger, and I'm not a child myself and I wasn't raped by my dad or something, then abortion is not an option.

869,"1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.  2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.  3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is  always  something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is  not  a party. But it's  their  choice, something  they  have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that ""if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen"" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.  As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the ""child"" only because the ""child"" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.  4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a  fact  the earth is round for example. Some have the ""opinion"" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not  that  big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is  not  upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.  Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.  Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.  2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.  That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice.",1,1

So yeah, 15%.  The problem is for you, most don't know about abortion, what it actually entails, why it is actually performed, in what numbers, and what women did before it was available.  Once they know these numbers; that before it was legal there were just as many abortions but instead they were performed in alleys and basements, that the vast majority that have abortions do it in the first 2-4 weeks, that the vast majority also were either raped or are having an aborition due to some medical issue, or that the women you and your ilk constantly demonize, the ones who casually decide on this course of action make up such a low percent you might as well outlaw instances of albino,  then even those answering ""oh yeah whatever, I'm pro-life"" would actually change to pro-choice.

Really the only lesson your silly book teaches on this is that hiring a prostitute is healthier than jacking off all the time... which I agree with by the way.

885,"And your taxes wont  link   Not even mentioning that abortion isn't murder,  I see a pattern of you often being misinformed.  Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.

The only thing it does is drive a bunch of young girls with their whole lives ahead of them into dirty basements to get the procedure where they may or may not get out alive.  Humans need abortion, and humans need a safe and legal way of getting the procedure done.   If  you  don't want an abortion  you  don't have to have one.

As for yours:   Killing the baby after a certain amount of weeks is painful to the baby   And you have proof of this I assume? Oh wait you don't? Of course not because it is not true.   If a man kills a pregnant women he is charged with two accounts of murder   This law in no way magically makes a fetus any more or less sentient. If I made a law that toasters were human, it would not make it so.   A born child effects a mother just as much as a baby. should all the mothers who think their children are to much of a burden be allowed to kill them   While listening to you now try to only refer to fetuses as babies, and so then needing to call a child a ""born child"" is hilarious, this sentence makes no sense. Everyone knows a ""born child"" should not be killed. That is not the issue, it is the cluster of cells within a woman that has no feelings and no personality which is the issue.   The issue doesn't seem to be whether it is a life form or not, but rather where it is and who it is effecting   Uh, what? Since when? No, the issue is that it is not a  person , and as such only an extension of the woman's body until about the third trimester, and so she should do with it what she chooses.  That pre-baby thing is  not  ""someone"" at all.  And there is nothing wrong with abortion.",1,1

At any rate, your link only further's my point since it is not even until week 6 that any sort of brain wave is detected and the vast vast majority of abortions happen in the first two weeks.   And  your link says nothing of being self-aware or feeling pain... which is my argument.  What you have done is  changed  my argument to one you feel you can argue against. However, whether a fetus were inside a human, or laid in a nest, the fact would remain it has no capacity for any of the thought or emotion which makes it human, and therefore I would still not be against abortion.  And I'm refusing your enemy request. You pro-force-women-rape-victims-and-teenag e-girls  to have kids they don't want get all emotional on this subject.

My question to you: Why did your mother not destroy you while you were nothing but a cellular glob?  Answer: Because your mother, and probably your father, loved you more than they loved themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hypocrite! You are ready to justify the killing of human fetuses, while at the same time ignorant of the fact that ‘your’ bullshit argument is possible by reason of your mother’s refusal to kill you while your were nothing but a cellular glob!   A female like you who is willing to justify the most cowardice of crimes against her own would-be progeny will commit any manner of crime against her own offspring. So, I think you should make certain that no cellular glob that is human in nature should ever be allowed to grow within your womb, for any child that is born of your matrix will most likely be sacrificed for your own selfish benefit.  This is no argument!! Why, because, you have confessed to the innocence of killing your own would-be progeny.   Down-vote all of my arguments! It still will not change the fact of your willingness to advocate not only the killing of all human fetuses (yes, all human fetuses), but the killing of your own would-be children.   Go ahead! Justify yourself, for your response is nothing more than a self-justification via the state agreeing with you that should kill your un-born progeny.   Oh, I can say much more about females such as you. Please, provoke me!  BTW, how many children have you given birth to?",1,2

Silly criminal, debates are for just persons with just intentions, not criminals with crime in the seared conscience!  STFU? Create Debate is not a forum for justifying the unjustifiable. Create Debate is a debating format for rational thought. Killing an un-born fetus cannot be rationalized! So, why do you stretch the intention of debate? I know! You are justifying your intent!

(Self-refuting argument)  I am not God, the creator of the heavens and Earth. Would you care to debate or find someone to debate that proposition?   Again, No man is a woman.

But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.   1 is not 4 is a proposition. The proposition is not an accounting statement. It is a proposition that asserts that 1 and 4 are not predicable of each other.

However, in a sense we can irrationally argue everything! Agreed!  You have claimed that “all issues are debatable” while at the same time failing to support your proposition. The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i.e. not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic.   There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.

The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident.   Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring. And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves.

First, logically explain me why do you think this is absolutely false, as in, there's absolutely no situation in which this could be true, no matter which other factors are involved.   No, the principle of pro-abortion is: “Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.” The principle is true to fact; it is not false to fact. My assertion is indicating the ethical standard of pro-abortionists. I am not saying that their principle is good or just, I am affirming the principle of their agenda.  Now, consider the principle of the anti-abortionist: Human fetuses and embryos are not sacrificial.  Does this help?      Also, I'd like to say that I'm not sure about my opinion on abortion... I do think that interrupting a pregnancy is not good, but I cannot simply ignore the problems an undesired child might bring to its family and society. At this point in my life, I wouldn't consider abortion, but I don't feel like I can make this decision for other people, so I wouldn't like it to be ""banned"". This matter puzzles me, so I don't usually join debates related to it. I just came into this one because I saw your comment about criminals and the undebatable, so now I'm here just looking forward to seeing you logically prove that there's absolutely no situation in which sacrificing a human embryo is the less of two evils. I'm looking forward to a debate.   I’ll reply to this part after we clearly understand one another about the truth of the principle of pro-abortion. This is a fair approach.",1,2

Hopefully people here aren't against adoption - it is one of the few options for mothers who can and do go through with a pregnancy even when the mother and or father cannot support the child.  One other thing to mention - while you may feel strongly that one choice is better than the other - making something legal or illegal should meet a different test; for example - if a woman is 5 months pregnant and finds out she needs chemotherapy - should the government force her to not get the treatment and risk killing herself and the child all at once?

I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1,1
944,"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it.

945,"Yes, There is no shame, women fail to carry a fetus to term more often than not without artificially inducing rejection, medical abortion only artificially induces this natural process, the artificiality of inducing this seems like it has no more moral significance than it occuring naturally. This is because the fetus doesnt develp consciousness until the onset of the third trimester - prior to this point (more than ~99% of all abortions occure in the 1st trimester) there is no moral status to the actions taken with regards to the preservation of the fetus. This is true for surgical abortions too since they also occure during the first trimester.   The morality of abortion has to do with the freedom to have them, not the act of doing them, since the act of doing them is for all reasonable accounts an a-moral action. It should be everyone's right to have an abortion because people should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.",1,1
946,"people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions. fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible). The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents. Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.",1,1
947,"We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery. It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)  Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small. Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people. A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences. There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body. You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions. Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established. A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.   Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).   Morality only applies to the parent when there is an abortion because the fetus is not yet a person - moral actions are between people and about the responsibility to actual people. Fetuses have not met the necessary requirement. This has to do with intrinsic vs extrinsic value - the fetus has no intrinsic value (no value from within).  The fathers rights are always categorically less than the mothers. he can express a claim but this claim can be superceeded by the mother.",1,2
948,"It is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -""if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents."" - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.",1,2
949,"her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK   I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you. A man is HALF the responsibility of a  pregnancy . It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?",1,1
950,Will you just go away and actually really people's arguments for once? I said aborting a baby at 24 weeks is inhumane as it has a chance to survive if the mother were to deliver naturally. I've also previously said the abortion gestation should be lowered from 24 weeks.  The problem you're not getting here is that I don't believe people should just go around aborting the babies all the time. I believe a negative circumstance should give the woman the choice to abort.,1,1
951,"It has nothing to do my with my  approval . I'm using negative circumstance as an example as to why a woman might abort.  Not a few weeks earlier I do believe the youngest was 22 weeks. I'm not arguing that, which leads me to believe you DO NOT read the arguments people make! I think the latest gestation for abortion should be lowered.  Here you go Mr. Science.  Most scientists agree that pain is experienced in the cortical areas of the brain, which do not develop until the second trimester. Painful experiences result in autonomic (they occur automatically during pain) physiologic changes that can be measured. For example, when we fell pain, our bodies produce endorphins and cortisol to help deal with the pain. One study was conducted on fetuses during blood draws. This study showed elevated fetal plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin response to intrauterine needling early in the second trimester but not before.  So the first trimester is an ideal time for abortion which is when most occur anyway. It's extended mostly for medical reasons as some deformities and disabilities cannot be detected until the second trimester which is a time I will agree the woman has a right to an abortion in the second trimester. Answered now?",1,2
952,"She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either   Why don't you respond to my posts? I've said this before but woman do take measures to not get pregnant by using contraception. Contraception  fails . I got pregnant on the contraceptive pill which I took correctly, it happens (I didn't abort by the way, but it's just an example). Or do you consider contraception killing of a potential child too?   The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame..   Wow , you're one hell of a sexist! Why does a woman have to take sole responsibility of a pregnancy? How dare you say no one else to blame! The man is just as responsible for the action of sex and creating a life yet he wouldn't get your giant speech on the immorality or creating unwanted life. Not once in the whole discussion have you ever mentioned the males role in creating a baby just how terrible the woman is.   Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body   She was  conceived  in a test tube. She didn't spend 9 months on a petri dish growing. Her embryo was placed into a womb and relied on a woman's organs to live. Your statement is all wrong.   If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not   The man is not the issue? Do you realize how many woman get abortions because the person who impregnated them pressured them into doing so? The men often  want  the woman they got pregnant to abort. He is just as responsible for creating the life as she is and if  wants  her to abort then he is just as responsible for the termination.",1,1
953,"The responsiblity is HERS   Stop saying this the man is half responsible for pregnancy he had sex and impregnated. Pregnancy is the responsibility of two people.    You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not   I'm sorry I must have missed saying that men have no right to decide if his child is aborted. Oh wait that's because I didn't say that... My claims of you being sexist are because what you said  is  sexist. You're just trying to stipulate what I think when I have not said anything along the lines of males shouldn't be involved or have a say.    You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support   Huh? Every woman that has a child is single and goes after the father for child support? Not that this has any relevance to abortion since the child would have to be born for a father to pay for it.   The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this   Sexist again. He allows himself to do it as much as she allows him.    THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD   I don't deny him the right. The mother does, not once have I said this is right or correct. Stop putting words into my mouth. And they aren't always denied the right anyway. A lot of woman consult with the father before having a termination.   and your giving her a pity party   So any father who provides for his child, within a relationship or not, is simply giving their child money out of pity? Don't be so idiotic. And stop implying that all a father does is pay money he cares for the child as much as the mother. And by the way, damn right he should pay. He had sex without contraception he knew the consequences as much as the woman, he should be involved with providing financially as much the mother!    Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried   Since a unborn baby relies on the mother to provide for it through the umbilical cord of course it's a part of her. The embryo didn't rely on the petri dish to nurture and nourish it.   But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   I try my best to avoid getting angry but you just keep making up awful lies about me. I not once said anyone isn't worthy to live or deserves to die. I said I understand if a woman wants to have an abortion for these reasons.   You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic.   Who did I blame? When did I say a woman is dragged into an abortion clinic?  Look debate with me all you like but don't for one moment assume that you know everything about my opinions and thoughts. Instead of accusing me of ludicrous opinions and awful things that I have said not said perhaps ask for my view on a topic.",1,1
954,I can play the downvote game too. Not really a response to my argument though is it.,1,2
955,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it’s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it’s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong again….   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",1,1
956,"Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married   Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity.   Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion…  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murder….I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know…   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.",1,1
957,"This debate is really old and I can't find the post that you're disputing to read what you're replying to, since I have about 80 arguments in that one debate. Perhaps clarify or quote?",1,1
958,"It is neither right nor wrong. I agree that the latest time to have an abortion should be reduced. In the UK it currently stands at 24 weeks, which is also an age a baby can survive.   I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy. If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that? I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice.  At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask? Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)?  My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating. If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet? We would be in a massive state of poverty, much more drastic than we see now.",1,1
959,"Do you actually read anything anyone types? I said babies as young as 22 weeks have survived hence I think they need to lower the gestation period.    without intervention no baby could survive birth without help   Seriously? Woman have been giving birth on their own for thousands of years. People still do. Gone are the days in America and the UK where you would crouch down in a field and push you're little sprite out. But more and more woman are opting for a natural intervention free home birth. And that's JUST in developed countries. In poorer countries they generally just get on with it.   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life?   I'm not, the mother of the child is. And if she can't feed herself let alone provide for a child and she decides to abort that's her choice and perhaps a sensible one.   You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   When did I say no one has a right to live? You're acting like I perform abortions on a daily basis. I said it's up to a mother if she wants to abort her child, I didn't say it's up to me.   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society   Are you seriously comparing me to the Nazi that is Hitler? Really? Because I support a woman's  choice  to abort. You mad? You seem it.   Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.    Can we just make it perfectly clear that I do not control worldwide abortion. Nor am I responsible for abortion. Nor do I make a choice for anyone to abort. Why are you blaming me for every abortion a woman decides to have because I believe she has the right to that choice? You have read way too much into a small paragraph I wrote. I simply gave reasons why a woman might choose to abort and supported that. I don't remember saying ""HEY YOU THERE! ABORT YOUR BABY IT MIGHT BE FAT!"".   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?   What? I've never made a choice for anyone to live or die or wanted/had the right.   It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, t is a fact that the eggs in a female is human   Does that mean if someone masturbates they are aborting a human life? Does that mean when a woman menstruates she is aborting a human life? They are not human until they meet, implant and develop.    I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts   Stop talking to me about conception, I've had a child I know how it works.   What is the goal of every abortionist?   To do what they  feel  is right for them and their unborn child.  Let me ask you a question now. I have contraceptive coil in to stop me from getting pregnant. Do you think I am aborting human life?",1,2
960,"You chose to act irresponsibly.   I got pregnant whilst using the contraceptive pill, it's not as uncommon as you think. Don't assume every person who is pregnant isn't responsible. Just to clarify I didn't abort her, I have a daughter. However I'm just using this as a point that not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception.  Now, rape and incest aren't the only circumstance that warrant abortion. Have you considered medical problems, deformities and disabilities in an unborn baby? What about a heroin addict, a alcoholic? What about someone with severe mental health problems (bi-polar, schizophrenia, BPD)? How about a homeless person? Do you think it is okay in these cases?  I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy. It's how the mother (or doctor)  perceives  the circumstance of her pregnancy. If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.",1,1
961,"So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY   You really are a sexist pig. The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy. It's not solely a woman.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion   Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that. I'm not saying you  should  abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do.   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die?    You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever. I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people  should . But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does.   .Hitler had the same idea did you know that?   Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler. It's so rude.   You are making excuses for the killing.   I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations. Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks   I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low. Hence I said ""life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)"" Oh and in response to your question about I meant, I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish. But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so. And don't call me a hypocrite, because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances.   What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time   This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all? A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort. And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active, and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception. If you couldn't be bothered to read it that's your problem.",1,1
962,"If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery?   Your surgery opinion is stupid. I never had someone, unless I knew them on a highly personal level, talk about surgery. When was the last time someone waltzed up to you in work and said ""hey, today I'm having a groin abcess drained!""   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   This the UK abortion act.  To comply with the 1967 Abortion Act, two doctors must give their consent, stating that to continue with the pregnancy would present a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children.  This is my view entirely. You can't pin point exact opinions or 'when is it murder' because it  always  depends on circumstance. If you mean gestation I can't answer that because it's purely scientific but I personally believe once a baby is a viable living age.",1,1
963,It's not just me being name called and demeaned by this person then...But hell apparently I'm a Nazi so what do I know?,1,1
964,"Finally I forgot to ask... You believe the male should have a right in the choice of abortion. What if the male wanted an abortion and the woman didn't? I assume you wouldn't be so happy about that right then. That's part of the reason why men don't generally have a  legal say , baring in mind most woman consult with the father and come to a mutual agreement anyway. You also argue that pregnancy is entirely down the woman yet you believe she shouldn't have the final say on the child. So which is it, is the woman solely responsible for pregnancy and the child or are both sexes equally responsible?",1,1
965,No they don't. Maybe if they had an appendix removed. But there as so many minor operations people don't talk about because it's  personal . Besides I know people who have had abortions and because I know them personally they have told me about them. Perhaps it's unheard of to you because no one would admit it to such a anti-abortionist radically opinionated person such as yourself.,1,1
966,"I think they did a scientific study a while ago about when a fetus can feel pain (or when the brain was active) and used that to create a cut off point of 24 weeks (in the UK). However this has obviously been discredited after babies as young as 22 weeks have survived, yet the abortion gestation has not changed. This is clearly inhumane, and I think it  should  be lowered. But how you would find a ethical gestation point is beyond me.",1,1
967,"I know this wasn't aimed at me but you never respond to my arguments, it's so frustrating! I give you legitimate sources and facts and instead of accepting them you just use the same lies to argue with another person!   no child at birth could survive without intervention   Like I said before anyone who believes this is stupid. How long have humans existed? It's only in the last 100 years that medicine has been greatly involved in child birth. Of course babies survive without medical intervention. It's natural to not have someone constantly shoving there fingers in you to check dilation. It's natural to give birth unaided. More and more woman now, even in developed countries are choosing not to have a child in hospital or with medical assistance. Instead they opt to give birth at home naturally and without medical intervention. People in poor countries just give birth in their bed and get on with it!    and want them dead.   I see you haven't moved on from blaming people for death. How is he responsible for all the woman in the world having an abortion. He didn't choose for them to abort they choose themselves. But at least he didn't get dubbed Hitler like you did for me.  Now would you mind responding to my many posts? I've given you the scientific facts about when a fetus can feel pain and when it's brain is active and how that stands with my views on abortion. Why won't you respond to science?",1,1
968,One if four to one in five pregnancies will end in miscarriage before the 12th week.,1,1
969,"You're the one who used God to support your debate actually. So yes, if you'd like to bring God into it then everyone else will assume this is a fair topic.  Christians forever believe that God chooses when a persons life begins and ends, so yes technically God decides to end the life of millions of unborn babies, that's if you choose to believe the Bible and Christianity teachings as the divine truth.",1,1
970,"And what is a negative circumstance that would meet your appoval?   Is it your business why a woman aborts? My neice was born at 23 weeks.....and babies have lived a few weeks earlier than that. Do you think you could pinpoint the EXACT point in the pregnancy when the fetus is work saving? I would think since abortion kills, that you would want to be right on the money here. Or doesn't it make any difference?  So what is your stance on abortion?",1,2
971,"So then you are one of the pro-aborts who believe the woman has the right to kill all the way through the 40 weeks, right? Wow.   But the created human being is not apart of the womans body that is what you just don't get. She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either. The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame...unless a rape occurred.   Abortion is the most performed medical procedure on earth. It is not like other procedures as abortion kills. The abortionists task, goal is to make sure the human being who is alive, is dead when he/she gets through with it. Now if you don't value life then you condone it. If you do, then you don't. Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body.,,just a safe place to grow and mature. Pregnancy and giving birth is the most natural thing on earth. It has been going on since the beginning of time. Most pregnancies are uncomplicated and most women would do fine never even seeing a doctor during pregnancy.   A child who is alive would get all the things you say they wouldnt. No hospital on earth would deny lifesaving measures taken to save a child. Even in the cases where parents want to deny....for religious reasons, the courts usually overturn their wishes. Also in the case of death...if parents kill their child out of the womb....its murder. If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not. So the born child gets protection, the womb child does not.",1,2
972,"Yes contraception fails..........but that does not chance the facts. The woman knows it MIGHT fail...and chooses to do it anyway. The responsiblity is HERS.   I believe what science says...  Some people do not make a connection between birth control and abortion. You probably see them as two different acts. The fact is however that some birth control are abortifacients because they work by causing early term abortions. The IUD seems to prevent a fertilized egg a new human being from implanting in the uterine wall. The pill does not always stop ovulation, but sometimes prevents implantation of the growing embryo. And now we have the RU-486 pill that aborts a new fetus, a new baby.   I am not a sexist....you are, your pro-choice position is sexist. You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not. I believe they should have a say. I would bet you dont. So who is sexist? LOL  You want the woman to have her cake and eat it too. You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support. What rights does the father of this newly concieved child have? NONE. You give him none......I don't. The fact is....pregnancy takes place in the womans body. The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this. If you think he has and should be responsible.......THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD? You are the sexist one, not me.   Our government tells the father.......YOU ARE NOT IMPORANT until the child is born, whether you want it or not...then get out your wallet. The woman holds ALL THE CARDS...and your giving her a pity party.   My statement is right about Louise Brown. She was concieved in a petri dish....nothing the mother or father did...helped.   It's a scientific fact that the mother is one distinctive and self-contained person and the child is another. Being inside something is NOT the same as being part of something and ones body does not belong to another’s body merely because of proximity. Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried.   In July 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill making it illegal to execute a pregnant woman. The logical reason for this decision is that a preborn child is an individual person, distinct from his mother and with his own separate right to life. As I said our laws are wishy washy.   Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence should they? I am sure you would think that premature baby lying in a hospital incubator deserves to live. Would the exact same baby deserve to live any less because she was still in her mother?  But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   Your worldview is sad...........  You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic. I picket them...never seen one dragged in, not in ten years. No woman gets an abortion unless SHE CONSENTS. Place the blame where it belongs. It is her body she has the right to decide. There are places that would help her....I work in one.",1,2
973,"So you are for abortion all throughout the pregnany am I right?  So a couple of weeks before she is due and wants to kill her baby, thats ok?  Should she be able to kill it say....one minute after its born?",1,2
974,"And that is wrong? Atheism is a religion. Listen when I debate I rarely if ever bring up religion, I don't have too. Science is clear about when human life starts.   Although I think you are unbelievable in what your post says here...again, I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....  I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.  I believe in free speech...so I am going to address and comment on the things you say here in the most honest way possible. Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close. They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb. Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated? Maybe you do I don't know. Your worldview is simply one of the coldest I have seen.   Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.  Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone.   Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share.   Studies show that what I am saying is true. If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over.  Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education? LOL Could you site that study would love to read it.  The fact is Guttmaucher says this...which does not make sense with what you are saying.  ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.""  "" Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24%.""  Now this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.    ""About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  This group is not going to school....most likely because they have multiple children at home. And if they are going for multiple abortion using it as birth control, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion.  "" Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children).""  Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up? LOL  Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically. She talked at KKK meetings encouraging its members to target blacks. The Negro Project, Eugenic plan for Blacks....read them they will tell you all about her racism.    http://www.dianedew.com/sanger.htm   ""The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.""

What Every Girl Should Know, by Margaret Sanger (Max Maisel, Publisher, 1915)   She was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks. She was an inspiration to Hitler...and obviously her views still guide PP and others like you today.  Your thinking is dangerous to society. You presume to know what is good for society...and that good has all to do with killing. Both Hitler and Sanger believed what you are saying. Look where Hitlers worldview took him.....and the others he mass murdered.  I find what you say about men and abortion commical. I am certainly praying at this point you have no children and won't. I can only imagine how they would be raised.   You say the woman should have the say.....and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby. Ahhhh you poor thing....not included.   Libertarian worldview.....all about themselves, nothing about anyone else...a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life. Liberty for your kind is slavery, killing those they think are unworthy to live. Freedom of expression for you people is the gun....pointed at someones head. No absolutes....people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society, even if it hurts their own family.   Your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral...that speak to your conscience and lack of one. For you rape could be good in some circumstances....and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live. God only knows who is in that group.  Your worldview is not logical at all in fact I find it hidiously evil and dangerous. It strips away the preciousness of life and living. What a sad world you live in. Which is why those that value life....need to keep you close.",1,2
975,So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?  You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?,1,2
976,So why are you not answering this question? It speaks volumes.,1,2
977,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......it’s NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said it’s unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, “It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.”  Am I calling names? Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crass…sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blame……and blame you do, for what is a woman’s issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortions….because I know what it’s like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess what………..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted on……‘You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.”  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robbery….and they are caught….does the police just say….ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didn’t show up, the nurse refuse to do it…the baby might have a chance.   You said, “ Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.”  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isn’t that what it’s all about, you said so yourself didn’t you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,“ Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.”  I said, if a woman and man are married……he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she can’t hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificate…and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, “What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.”  Well you are wrong again….   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issue….personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  “If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",1,2
978,Even the Supreme Court called atheism a religion.    http://www.wnd.com/news/ article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=45874     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/ index?qid=20100610223655AAyJOMg    So you are wrong.,1,2

980,"You did not answer my question libertarian, and I don't blame you.  Would you condone the killing of your own family your own children should they become handicapped or mentally challeneged. You said killing this segment of the population was warrented. Just wondered if that included your own flesh and blood?",1,2
981,So let me get this straight for the record Mr. Cant Debate without a Potty Mouth  Your daughter was in a car accident and became handicapped. You would kill her?  Your son had a stroke.....you would kill him?,1,2
982,So killing is wrong...but you condone some killings if it fits what you define as moral.,1,2
983,"But you are siding with the side that is pro-abortion. The child in the womb is never at fault, never deserves to be dismembered alive. It does not matter what excuse you can come up with...the unborn does not deserve it. But people like you side against life for reasons that YOU THINK are good enough for it to be killed.   You advocate death for the child of the mother who is mentally imbalanced. You said she might damage her baby should she be allowed to continue the pregnancy. You care more about the ""what if's"" than what actually might happen. What do you think abortion is? Why not take the chance that she might not harm the baby? You want to kill it by abortion anyway...this is a violent act.   What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   A woman does have a choice. Allow the unborn a chance at life by doing what is right, or kill it and be responsible for ending anothers life because of selfish reasons, which is morally wrong.",1,2
984,"it is a yes or no. Its yes, I am prolife and believe the unborn has a right to live....or no I do not value all life and believe women should always have the right to kill. Less than 1 percent of ALL ABORTIONS are done for actual medical reasons.   SAved it all the pain? How do you know it cant feel pain? Abortion is legal dismemberment of a human being WHILE IT IS ALIVE. Now if this is not child abuse I don't know what is.   The issue is whether or not the unborn deserves personhood, whether or not women have the right to kill on demand for any reason.",1,2
985,"And who decides whether it lives or dies? Who has the right to do this?  So when is that, exactly when it feels pain? Even if it does not feel pain, does not change the fact that what you are killing is a living human being.",1,2
986,"It is a living human being...and you think its ok to just kill it for no reason. Wow.   When or what excuses are ok to kill the unborn. Could you make a list....?  If you go to Alan Guttmaucher and look up the reasons why women abort...99% are for social reasons, they have NOTHING to do with HEALTH issues.   It is sad that you do not value the life in the womb.",1,2
987,"And how would the fetus be poisoned? You mean the mother did drugs or something?  And the pregnancy you said could go wrong? How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.  You say abortion should be stopped? How? And what reasons is ok to kill?  Why are abortions important? To the unborn killed? Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?  The solution for woman today....is abortion which most use as one method of birth control. Most women do not have just one abortion...but two and three. So they are killing multiple times. The humanity I am fighting for are the 99% of unborns killed for social reasons.",1,2
988,"You said, “Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.”  It takes two, the woman can’t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married…does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they take…then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, “Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.”  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesn’t want to be involved. Example…..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trial…..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She did…because whether reckless sex happened or not…the risk she took didn’t pan out….she got pregnant….and where is the dad???????  You said, “If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?”  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, “Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?”   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings “  You also said, “You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.”  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a sty………LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignorance…go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take it…roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like it’s a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two. Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, “You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?”  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, “It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. “This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.”  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes off…knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman?  You said, “An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, “The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.”  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the bases…have not scored a grand slam… and she says no……..it’s no, you can’t come in. If he does against her wishes it’s rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it won’t affect him in the least…..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     “How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.”  It does take a man and a woman to procreate…which is why I also am against same sex unions, it’s not natural…but that’s another debate. They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same page….but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, “Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, “I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.”  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   “In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.”  Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….I should have known better…and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didn’t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witness…to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same page…until later…when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didn’t. Worldviews change….and mine did drastically. We have adjusted…and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, “I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?”  Distraught about what? Tell me….how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I don’t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch this……..and if you don’t, think about the reasons why you won’t. Search your heart…about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have children….put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     “I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.”  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldn’t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? It’s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, “You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, “Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.”  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  “What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.”  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t. People act out of fear….and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM…I am talking about the people in his own country….the people who could have physically taken himout….the guards, etc.   Abortion is like that….people sit by and do nothing….they think anything they do….won’t change the laws, won’t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion….if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and good…….abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortion….wow….how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheists….so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evil………..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, “Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.”  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thing……..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to none……but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, “I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.”  You condone murder….I never called you a racist.     You said, “I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?”  I never use violent adjectives on you….you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classless…  .  “I didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.”  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if you’re wrong…you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with them…..being with family etc…would be just a tad bit good…you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you can’t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not go…that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  “You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?”  It’s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heart….I can’t, scripture does not allow me to do that…not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you don’t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done that…I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in? LOL  You said, “No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.”  You don’t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, “Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.”  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep now…. I post rarely from Wikipedia….and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know….  “I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c”  This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, “What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?”  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the world……its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the law…just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Can’t let this one go……your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlier… You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.",1,2
989,And is abortion for social reasons ok? I think you ran from answering this one. You said they are wrong....  WHEN?,1,2
990,"I see what you are saying. The only exception I see for abortion is if the mothers life is in danger which is less than 1% of all cases... I see that you are really prolife and that is a good thing, I am so glad. Thumbs up to you.",1,1
991,"Abortion is immoral to anyone with a heart and a sense of what is right and wrong. But our law in America allows a mother to kill her unborn child, as long as she hires it done. If she does it herself she may face being charged with taking a life. Our laws are whishy washy about this. They do not give the unborn personhood and protection, they stand on the principle that its the womans body and then they stipulate when she can have the abortion. Science is clear to when human life starts....and it does not start after nine months of pregnancy.",1,2
992,Again a wonderful post animegirl. People especially women do not want to take responsiblity for their actions...it's always someone elses fault.,1,2
993,"I support what you say...but I would add this....when a child is concieved...there is nothing potential about it. It is already a living human being.  And I would ask you to think about the rape and incest clause in your position.  Let me ask you this.........if you believe a human life starts at conception, how is death right for even a child of rape? If you walked into a nursery full of babies and the nurse told you that one out of the twentys mother was raped...would you be able to pick that child out? Life is life and although rape is a violent act...so is abortion. So rape is the first wrong....and then on top of that abortion is another. The woman can live with two crimes. That is the same as incest. If you are pro life that means you value ALL LIFE, not just some.  If you are pro-choice and think that abortion should be legal even though you think its gruesome and wrong.....then you are not pro-life. Being pro-life is being against abortion period...unless the woman is dying on the table...and then in most cases both can be saved.",1,2
994,Omgosh....what a wonderful and refreshing post. Not used to seeing ones like yours....most people here are pro-abortion and do not value all life.   What you said about killing and cruelty to pets is right on. Hollywood especially will go out of its way to bash people for this...then be first in line to support killing human beings. One answer for them to just be promiscuous.,1,2
995,"Abortion is taking the life of a living human being. We see society up in arms about animal rights and animal abuse. Isn't abortion really the worst case of child abuse you can think of? Every abortionists task is to dismember, kill in any way possible...the living human child in the womb. Death is the only goal. The fetus might be small but nevertheless science says it is human and it is alive. What is it called when you take someones life without their permission? Isn't this murder? If you defend the womans choice to kill saying it is her choice....then should you enslave her by putting restrictions on when the killing takes place? Thus late term abortions should be legal if you are pro-abortion. When does her right to body sovereignty end?   I am all for the right of women to choose but when that choice kills another living human being that right should not exist. The living human growing inside her body is not part of her. It has its own bodily systems, its own DNA, fingerprints etc.",1,2
996,"Another moral relativist......sigh....  If there is nothing wrong with abortion then how can you say abortion is wrong after 24 weeks? My neice was born at 23 weeks and last year graduated from college. Although it was a long road...she is normal, in fact she is brilliant and graduated with over a 4.4 grade point. To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy. They say the happiest people live in poorer countries. You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society. Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?  It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, it is a fact that the eggs in a female is human.....when the sperm of a male homosapien meets the egg of a female homosapien.........starts another separate HUMAN BEING, who has its own organs, finderprints and DNA. Louise Brown the first test tube baby was NOT APART OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE WAS CONCEIVED. She began her life in a petri dish. She was a human being from conception. Could she sing the Star Spangled Banner, do times tables, drive a car? No But can a baby who is just born do any of those tasks? No   HUMAN EMBRYOLOGY, by Dr. Bradley M. Patten.  He states, ""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermaozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""   Dr. Keith Moore's text on embryology, referring to the single-cell zygote says, ""The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being. He also states, ""Each of us stated life as a cell called a zygote.""  Dr. Keith Moore, the Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 2d ed. (Philadelphia, Penn)  J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics (New York : McGraw Hill) In their work on biology and obstetrics, state, “The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.”  Dr. Louis Fridhandler, in the medical textbook “Gametogenesis to Implantation Biology of Gestation,” vol.1, ed. N.S. Assau (New York: Academic Press) refers to fertilization as “that wondrous moment that marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.”    Doctors, E.L. Potter and J.M Craig write in Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers) “Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.”  These doctors tesified before a United States Senate Committee on life.   Dr. Alfred Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.  He said, “I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life….I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of puberty….is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.”  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He says” after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.”  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: “By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.”  I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?   Could you just answer this one question for me. What is the goal of every abortionist?",1,2
997,"Ok what about women who are raped? This is a violent act for sure. But are two acts of violence better than one? I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being. It is not given a sedative...it is ripped, burned and dismembered while the heart beats, when it quite possibly is moving. So how is the act of rape the new living childs fault? If you walked into a nursery in a hospital and the nurse told you that one out of the ten babies theres mother was raped...do you think you could pick it out? No....it has just as much right to life as the child whose mother was not raped. The mother who was raped not only will remember the rape, but the day she...took it upon herself to kill another living person. So if you value life........you value all life and you give it a chance.   You bring up the death penalty.....I am not pro-death penalty...I do believe in prison however...and not prisons with television, internet, and work out rooms.   I did give proof some of the top doctors around the world, researchers...I mean what more do you want? Many of these doctors testified in front of the Senate on when life begins.   And your last question.....  I believe that women know when they have sex they might become pregnant, even if they take precautions. I believe that when a life is started...that that life should be allowed to be born. Nine months is not that long when you know it can save another living persons life. There is always adoption. What is nine months...compared to killing?   This is about doing what is right, not only for the woman but the life growing inside her...that she help start. I do not believe woman should have the right to kill.   You however believe that she does, because IT IS HER BODY. And that right should not be taken away or controlled by anyone else. So let me ask you this......  If the woman wanted to abort in the ninth month, eighth month this would and should be her right.....you certainly would not want her to be enslaved by a baby even in late term........right?   You cant have it both ways.",1,2
998,"It's ironic that a woman can hire someone to kill her unborn, but should she do it herself, be charged with a crime. Why is this?   The fetus was once recognized as a person in our country but after 1973 it lost its identity and was put up on the chopping block, the bullseye was placed on every unborn fetus's forehead.   You talk about bodily sovereignty....I would assume you mean the right for a woman to abort at any time during the pregnancy since she certainly keeps her own body throughout the term. This means any woman because she has sole ownership of her body can decide what to do with it, even kill in the ninth month. Am I right? Is that what you are saying?  Pregnancy is not dangerous to 99% of those doing it. Less than 1% of ALL WOMEN getting abortions do it because of health issues. And in most case both mother and baby can be saved. So most woman abort because of social issues.   Having a baby is a natural thing to do. Many women do not even go to doctors to be watched and have no problems at all. So don't make the statement that it carries risks above and beyond what pregnancy implies. How many woman die a year in childbirth compared to those who have successful pregnancies? Not many.  You are saying two things in your statement. She owns her body, but she doesn't. Can she abort in the 9th month? NO..........but she should have the right to abort. Abortion kills. If that is what she wants to do, to kill it even in the ninth month, what right do you have then based on what you have said here.....to deny her the right?",1,2
999,"Funny that for hundreds of years abortion was considered murder. Even today if a woman kills or tries to kill her unborn she can be tried. And if someone else kills or tries, they can be prosecuted and go to prison. Scott Peterson...killed that which you say is not a person that deserved to live.   You talk about body sovereignty......then you cant ever take it away...which means you are for allowing late term abortions. You certainly would not want to enslave the woman carrying a nine month old unborn that she decided to kill at the last minute.   Right?",1,2
1000,"If someone says they are pro-choice even though they would never get one themselves...that is the same as being pro-abortion, because to the life in the womb, it makes a lot of difference how someone views THEIR LIFE.",1,2
1001,"She has a right to unhook herself...but she is not slaughtering the child. The child might die might not....nature takes it course.  The fetus in the womb is not dying on its own its fine. The mother pays someone to kill it. This is totally different.   So since you are pro-abortion....I assume you are pro-abortion since you do give the woman the right it is her body.....to kill it even after nine months.  Got one for ya. The woman is in scheduled for a csection in one week. She gets scared and decides that she does not want the baby. Is perfectly acceptable for her to kill it at nine months?  The woman took the risk that she might get pregnant. If she did not want a baby she should not have had sex, or done something to prevent it like sterilization.   And for your information the baby is not part of the mother. It has its own DNA, bodily systems, heart, circulatory system, fingerprints. If the baby is part of the mother....do you think that she should be able to kill it after its born?",1,2
1002,"I respectfully think you are wrong.  Hiking is not dangerous really....mountain climbing on the other hand is. You take risks to do it. This is taking responsiblity for your actions...even if the risks you took backfired and became reality. And this is the case for intercourse between a man and a woman. THE RISK IS ALWAYS THERE....unless the woman or the man is sterile. If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection....and that protection broke....how do you think she would feel? Anxious? Worried? If a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man...and later learned she forget to take one the day before...how would she feel? Worried? Sure she would....because mistakes happen...but that does not change the risk factor that she took. The risk was there...and human error, condom malfunctions can happen. How is that the fault of the new life they both created? It is unfortunate, but nevertheless, the life got started.   I dont think it should be individual opinion....it should be what the facts state. And it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being. Now its small, but that does not change its state. A little ant working hard on a hill....has all it needs to live....its small...but the workings of his bodily system works. And a fetus however small...has the same qualities...but is human. The heart starts at around twenty days...and every day grows and something develops. The issue is...does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent. We have people here who are against killing animals for food, but they are pro-abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral. Figure that one out.   If you say they are responsible..is the responsible thing to do is kill it? How responsible is that? Do you think that two wrongs make a right?   You say there should be no laws to enslave the woman, that she should NOT be forced to carry a baby to full term. That means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month. So don't come back and say........""ooops...now I don't mean that...only until its viable.."" And gee when is viablity and what does that matter....the woman does not want it...and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants. Anythink less as i said would enslave her and FORCE HER TO DO WHAT YOU SAY, NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO...in this case our government. How humane is your statement really? Donating blood does not kill anyone.   And in the United States we can really force people to give blood. When someone is arrested for drunk driving...most often they have to give blood. Denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence.  I don't get that you think its immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over their childs, yet believe the mother can kill her child while it is in the womb. ????????  Yours is certainly not the Republican stance thats for sure.",1,1
1003,"Abortion is one sided, it is either right or wrong...there can be no neutrality. It is either moral to kill the fetus or its not. Why do you sit the fence?   If a woman has the right to her body as pro-aborts maintain...then abortion should be legal until the childs natural birth....nine months. You say its unacceptable.....at a certain point. Why?",1,2
1004,"So are some rapes good?  There is only one truth.  If there is an car accident and there are ten observers who are interviews by the police....there are ten different accounts to the story. That does not mean that there are ten ways it happened. There is only one way it happened and one truth.   The truth is the truth even if we can't see it.   What is radical about saying that abortion is wrong? It once was murder in America it was not radical back then. Does morality change? Is pedophelia wrong? Is there gray area in that?  What Hitler did...was that right or wrong...where is the gray area concerning the ovens?   Were the 9-11 radicals right in taking down and killing all those on 9-11?   You said something completely contradictory here....""To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.""  You say its wrong....but its right. If you say the woman has the right to kill because it is her body...then you cant deny her this right throughout the entire pregnancy. Which means that you are killing way beyond the time of viability. Is the fetus less human at three months...than at nine? If you are pro-choice...then the answer to this would not make a difference.   Humans judge humanity all the time....our police, teachers, clergy, court systems, parents. We all judge. You are judging me by the statements I make.   I do not need you to tell me what is right and wrong, or anyone for that matter. I do not believe that it takes a village to raise a child. I believe we are responsible for what we say and do, that we are capable to decide for ourselves.   What is a human being?    http://www.thefreedictionary.com/human   It is a fact that the human being in the womb is alive before the abortion...is dead after the abortion. The human is killed. It is not an animal....a rock......it is human and has all the characteristics of a human being...even at the embryonic stage. A human is a human...whether alive or dead. This Cassie Anthony murder trial....Kaylee was found in skeletal form, nevertheless they were human remains. That which is in the womb...whether at one month, or nine....is human.  You said, ""If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.""  Humanity is not measured by consciousness. If so...the mentally retarded, those in comas, vegetative stages do not deserve it and can be treated like you say.... like masses of soulless meat. A hearless and barbaric statement to make.....  How do you know when a sould inhabits the body? In Christian scriptures....God controls this ...""before I formed you I knew you."" For you to say when a body has a soul.....is impossible. Are you god?  And if you are a humanist....why are you even mentioning souls....?  ""It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.""  Mass of meat? Are you a butcher or something? LOL   To say that those who are unconscious are not human have no soul.....that is insane and not scientific at all.   Just curious what you think about these...  Abortion to purify the races. (Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood, hated blacks and targeted them through abortion. Hitler admired her.)  Abortion for profit. Women selling their fetal body parts for cash.  Abortion because something is wrong with fetus...wrong sex, hair lip...etc  Abortion to control the population.   Like I said you are all over on this. Abortion is right, no its wrong when.....and when that time is you cant pinpoint. No one could do this while the human is growing in the womb.   Do you know when they can detect measureable brain waves in the womb? Why should this matter to you?       http://www.buzzle.com/articles/ brain-development-in-fetus.html     So all of a sudden at some time (you cant pinpoint) abortion is wrong. BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID EVERY WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO OWN HER BODY AND DECIDE FOR HERSELF?   As I said.....your comments are morally baffling...make no sense.",1,2
1005,"Somepeople do not agree with what is evil. We are disagreeing with abortion here. I see it as evil, you see it as a good. Where is the gray area?  And rape......in your opinion it is wrong...but what about other cultures?   And Hitler, he killed those who thought inferior and weak. Murder has always existed. But peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented. There are those who think our participation in the ME wars were wrong that they served no good. Others disagree. So evil is in the eye of the beholder. So when you say fight evil with evil.....its subjective, because people might not agree which side is right and which side is wrong. Yet you say there is only one truth. How do you determine what is truth on your own? And should everyone be subjected to YOUR way of thinking?  It is not radical to say something is wrong.  And stop calling me names...you look foolish. Your example is sick. You fall in love with a child.....???? A child is a child...and it is never right to have sex with a child if you are an adult. There are laws to prevent this from happening...to keep children safe..from your way of thinking. Love can destroy people, families and communities.   You said, ""Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.""  FActs about abortion? I doubt that. What facts do you know just curious.   ""You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.""   The fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being. The abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing. That is a biological fact.   So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.  I find it sad that in your post you defend evil. Where is the balance in that?  ""Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness.""  For people who live godless lives it might. For people who do not consider all human life sacred....for those who are moral relativists it might. I find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious. That they lose the right to live while in this state. People who are in comas, under for surgeries...even sleeping is a form of being unconscious. So because a child is in the womb...does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically. When I was pregnant I used to push in on my baby....and prode it until it moved....aware of my touch.   Your view on life is sad. Vegetable people are nothing? You are so so cold. I feel sad for you really, that your worldview IMO of course is so empty. That you would compare a living person to meat. What a cold way of putting it.",1,2
1006,"If you are a woman and have a brain you know that any birth control method can fail, unless she has had a hysterectomy. So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY. It's not always about stupidity...but that does not chance the responsiblity part or the fact that says....a human life starts at conception.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion? Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped? Do you think that if you walked into a hospital nursery and you were told that one babys mother had been raped...that you would be able to pick it out? Why does two acts of violence make sense? So the woman goes through the rape and then knowing she killed the child inside her. Do you know how mothers would cope with this extra trauma?   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die? Wow...how compassionate and materialist you are. ARe you perfect in appearence? Lets abort babies because they have problems.......Hitler had the same idea did you know that? He believed in killing the weak, the dredges of society. Again you are blaming the unborn for the sins of the parent. I have personally seen drug babies...and while they have a hard time at first...they can be saved and they can lead normal lives. You are making excuses for the killing.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks...the woman who wants to finish school, the woman who does know who the father is, the woman who does not want another child of that sex?   You know it is sad that you feel this way...that you would be so judgemental that to solve a problem you have to kill a living human being. That you would speak for another human who cant speak for themselves, and choose death. You are choosing death...for all the ""what-if's""  What right do you have to determine how someone MIGHT LIVE?   What if you were poor....and the government said that everyone who made less than a certain amount couldn't have a child, that if you got pregnant you would have to abort because if you had one it would be a burdon on society. Would you be ok with that?  What did you mean by your comment....""life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)""? What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time?",1,2
1007,Where did you get the 15% stat? Could you post your source? Or did you just yank that from somewhere else...I won't mention.  The reason people don't talk about it that much is because of the nature of the subject. But politicians and womans groups....talk about and are very vocal about it.,1,2
1008,"I gave you scientific evidence where science says that once sperm meets egg, it is another living human being. Can't you read?   The thing is.....you have not done research on this topic. You have not even looked to see what science says about this. If you did you would know you are wrong. The sperm was alive, when it met the egg which was alive.   There is no moral middle ground on this...you cant sit the fence. You are pro-abortion because you say the woman has the right to choose. And if you give her this right, then who the heck are you to tell her when she can and cant abort....because thats personally when YOU THINK, it should be saved. You wont listen to what science says about life in the beginning........you ignore it....then you bring up what science says when fetus is viable. This is not balanced thinking at all. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMANS RIGHTS?",1,2
1009,"Why should it matter how many she kills? If abortion isnt anything for you....then why do you care? Should there be a limit on how many she can kill?   And I commend you on using the proper terms for abortion, the terms no pro-abort really will use. At least you put it out there for all to see.   ""Killing their baby""..........",1,2
1010,"I love when someone says what you just did in your post.   You don't care if they kill....in your mind its moral.........but  there should be a limit as to how many THEY CAN KILL.   LMAO  Honey, abortion is a form of birth control for a lot of women.",1,2
1011,"What I just said is fact like it or not. You want to say that abortion should be legal because its her body...her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK. You look silly. Our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision...he has no choice in the matter. Why men don't see this and storm in outrage I don't know. Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is.   You are cold. But then you respresent death to innocent human beings because you are a pro-abort. You champion killing. And that is what abortion is...whether its in the first month...or ninth, its killing. The abortionists goal isnt to shoot a documentary, or catch a fish, or play a round of golf.......it is to KILL THAT WHICH IS IN THE WOMANS WOMB. It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.  You're a typical pro-abort all over the place, not consistent at all. Sigh  If a child is gonna make her life awful...kill it. LMAO So compassionate of you.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe...  You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on.   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on........LOL  Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.  You are saying death should always be an option. How do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb? You don't.  You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed. Do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what you say and how it sounds. YOU YOU YOU....think   What do YOU think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk (hell infant babies cant talk either) and address the one who killed them, the one who presumed they would have a horrible life?   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing. LOL  You pro-aborts kill me....no pun intended.  What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.  You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only........(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed.... not allowed...after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.  I know the studies...I know people who have done the studies. The fact is....that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person. Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice. Life was not concieved to kill in this way, it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb.",1,2
1012,"I can't admit that of course because I am pro-life. Even in the case of incest and rape...the child is also the victim and has the right to life even though the mother had an act of violence thrust upon her. Abortion is also a violent and cruel act. We dont even abort animals like we do our own human children.   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   Or do you just think all cases of abortion are ok?  What do you mean medical necessity? Do you mean the less than 1% of the cases when abortion is perform to save the mothers life? In most cases both can be saved.   If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery? It is the most common surgery performed in America today. Do you ever hear a woman say....gee I cant have lunch with you cause I have to have an abortion that day. OR hear a discussion about abortion at the Thanksgiving table? Or a mother tell her kids....about an abortion she had? Why don't people talk openly about abortion today, especially the women getting them? If its moral....then why the stigma? IS THERE SOMETHING MORALLY WRONG WITH ABORTION?",1,2
1013,"Well Hollywood goes to doors for animals.....animals are put on the endangered list, and many people put animals above humans. We are however are not animals...and abortion is barbaric.   If you believe that a woman has the right to choose......then you must allow her that choice throughout the entire pregnancy, or you enslave her because YOU DONT THINK its right at that point. At what point does she loose control of the right to decide?   If you condone abortion....you are pro-choice, not pro-life. If there were a nationwide poll and we were allowed to vote.....1/ woman can choose 2/abortion illegal with stipulations....she was dying............which one would you choose? If you choose 1, then your vote is on the abortion side. How many lives did your vote save? NONE.",1,2
1014,Oh please....people have surgery all the time and talk about it. You are avoiding where I am taking you because your back is against the wall and you know it. No one talks about abortion because abortion is killing a living human being. That is fact. What woman wants people to know she did this?   If you value all life...the circumstances don't matter...only if the mother is dying on the table. Most people are pro-choice because they do not believe anyone should tell a woman what to do with their own bodies. Then they turn around and tell the woman she cant control it after the time they think its viable. Viability should not matter if you believe it is human and deserves the right to live.,1,2
1015,"Oh please....quit making excuses. People dont talk about it because its an act that kills a living human being. And it does not matter where abortion happens its the same thing. Most women do not come forth with this information because of the nature of abortion. IT KILLS. Women know what it does and they don't want to be judged. That is why so many women suffer in silence over past abortions.   I am not a hypocrite...you just don't get this issue. First of all your a man...and men are really not important in this issue...unfortunately. Most laws say after you ejaculate and implant the sperm your nothing....well unless she desides to have the baby and sues wrongfully for child support. Only then are you an issue. If your wife or girfriend get pregnant by you..........you have no say even if you want your child. And you have no idea what having an abortion is like.....or what a woman might just go through, physically or emotionally.   Your opinion would be like mine if I told a NFL player how it felt to be tackled on the field.   You losing it by calling names? Is that how you interact with people.....calling them names and using profanity. Your entire worldview is pathetic...and shows humanism for what it is....and empty worldview devoid of real happiness.   And I do not believe in human euthanazia or the death penalty.   As I said what you describe does not happen that often in the case of mothers immediately in danger of dying...except a tubal pregnancy. As I said...the life of the mother would come first. The doctor would treat the woman....and still would not have to cut the unborn apart.   If I really care about people, you mean the way you dont? I love people and I help and care for people especially people who are less fortunate than I am. It is sad that all you care about is yourself...that much is obvious. What a sad way to live.",1,2
1016,So elaborate on that.  Is abortion ok if the child is the wrong sex?  Something wrong with it?  Timing is wrong?  Dont know who father is?  Might be born into poverty?  Mother has to many other kids?  Mother cant afford it?  Mother wants to sell fetal body parts?  Rape?   Incest?  Woman might have stretch marks?  Which one is a good medical reason for abortion? Less than 1% of ALL ABORTIONS ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO ARE DYING. In most cases the baby can be saved.  Odd...you know its taking the life of a little human being...it gives you the shivers...you dont want to think about it......BUT YOU SAY ITS NOT MORALLY WRONG. LMAO  If its not wrong and the most widely performed surgical procedure in the country...world....then why do you shiver?   Did I miss something?,1,2
1017,What is the difference between a viable fetus (and many so called viable babies die after being born after 24 weeks) at 24 weeks and a fetus at 23 weeks? Do you know for a fact that one at 23 weeks would not survive? My neice was born at 23 weeks. Most pro-aborts here would say it is fine to kill them at that gestational age.   And tell me atypican....what gives anyone the right to kill a human being at any gestational age?  Do you know much about fetal development? Take a look at this website...if you click on the date it will show you an actual 3-D picture.   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-week-by-week    This one is 16 months....   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-images-16-weeks    Baby can show facial expressions and can hold head erect. The baby pumping over 25 quarts a day. Unbelievable. All this is happening well within the legal time a woman can abort. Tell me why this is not human.............    http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/ video?p=fetus+at+16+weeks,1,2
1018,Where did you get that 15% stat? You cant put a stat out there and not tell us where it was taken from.,1,2
1019,I beleive abortion should be illegal...so your question is not relavent.   I stated that the father does not get the choice to decide...not that I support his right to want an abortion.   I AM AGAINST ABORTION...NO MATTER WHO WANTS IT.  Men dont have a say because of Roe.......this has to do with privacy and the woman owning the right to her body. The make is a non issue.,1,2
1020,I brought science into this issue. One does not need to even mention God to know that abortion is the barbaric killing of a living human being. What don't you get?,1,2
1021,"First of all it is sad that you would call talking about the life of a human being bullshit. Shows you are losing control...or did not have it from the beginning. One can disagree with something and not use profanity.   I have shown by posting here what SCIENCE SAYS ABOUT LIFE AND WHEN IT STARTS. This has nothing to do with religion. As I have said...one need not even bring God into the equation to see that abortion is wrong.   Now what I find amusing is this....You say the woman has the right that its her body and she should be able to do with it what she wants. Then you turn around in some self-righteous way...and take this away from the woman in the third trimester. LMAO  Is there something wrong with abortion iamdavidh? You must think so or your views wouldnt be like this. Do you know anything about fetal development? You want to enslave a woman to pregnancy....you want to take her right to her body away. Shame on you.   For your information....no child at birth could survive without intervention. And even children born at full term might need medical assistance. What difference does it make whether that medical assistance takes place at 22 weeks....38 weeks or when its born?  If anyone is contradictory, inhumane, compassionless, cold, empty...as far as their worldview is....its you not me. I simply want to protect human life, the human life that is defenseless against people like you who pain a bullseye on their forhead and want them dead.   You are a blamer......you whine and you put the blame places to make yourself feel good about your lack of doing anything for anyone. Why should it be my responsibility to solve the worlds problems? What about personal responsiblity? You're a Democrat aren't you? You are the psychotic one, not me. I work at crisis pregnancy centers and I work at Right to Life and with a group, Silent No More. I do my share. What do you do for mankind besides complain?   I am crusading for life and for personal responsiblity.

1022,So you say its inhumane but still are pro-choice? What does that say about YOU?,1,2
1023,"Why are you bringing religion into this. Lets debate this from a scientific point of view. Tell me what science says about it.   You always know when someone loses it... they start swearing. Why should you be taken seriously when your potty mouth speaks more than the content of what you are saying? Shows a lack of knowledge and class.   And by the way....who says God causes miscarriages? Can't they be an act of nature? You hate God/idea of God so much that you can't even control your emotions. LOL  Jesus does not perform abortions. The woman walks in on her own, hires someone to kill the living human being inside her....that is an abortion. This is not a miscarriage.   Your so empty....",1,2
1024,Pro-aborts have a big problem. They celebrate abortion but don't want the label that goes with it. They don't want people to think they condone killing….  And your right…..they probably feel worse about killing those bugs with their cars…then they do living human beings.,1,2
1025,"What is false about anything I have posted concerning abortion?   This issue is a piece of cake. Let science and medicine speak the truth. The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive. Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   ""In the third month, your baby is the size of a small apple and is fully formed. She has grown from 1 to 3 inches and weighs about 1 ½ ounces by month end. Her head now sits on her neck and you can even see the whorl of a hair pattern on the top of her head. Her head is still very large and makes up half the length of her body. Her eyes are moving closer together and her ears are continuing to form. She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex. She is beginning to practice her swallowing too. Teeth buds have also begun to form, as well as fingernails and toenails. Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily. Your placenta has now developed and has taken over hormone production.""  Most abortions happen around this gestational age. Wow a lot happening eh? It is not just a glob of tissue.   THIS IS FACT. Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it. However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.",1,2
1026,"Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference. They don't like the label however but its the truth. I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who …DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB. This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention…standing up and saying…."" I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill."" They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice…they want the same thing….legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skin….compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb…..you think is the same thing? Laughable…won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being….hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you life…and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers…to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan said…it was so true.  “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”  Question….I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women….to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quote….""I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.""  What is wrong with owning the label? You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion? Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?  If there is…then why do you support it? If there isn't…why isn't the label ok?   LOL",1,2
1027,"And people who are pro-choice want abortions legal. They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing. And if we had a nationwide vote…and a pro choicer voted…which would he vote…..Pro-choice abortion or no abortion?   So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL  Abortion is taking a life and that is bad. Abortion procedures are inhumane,,,we don't even do it on animals like we do humans.  Nothing is good about abortion.   Now I know why you won't answer the …do you believe the woman has the right to kill throughout her entire pregnancy? Because if you say yes…then wow…you look terrible even to the pro-choicers who use viability as an excuse,,,and if you say no…then you enslave the woman and your excuse that abortion should be legal because its the woman's body and should be her decision….is shot down. What is it….answer the question. I am debating your position on this and need to know. Are you afraid to answer?  It proves that you were blessed with life…..circular or not. The statement Reagan made is true. We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution….but without life we can't have the others. And we deny that which is in the womb the things you and I take for granted.",1,2
1028,"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion. You people do not care about medical facts, scientific facts. IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST TO YOU. You want abortion legal…on demand period.   The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Now I know what our laws say…that killing should be an option for women. But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission? The unborn can't speak for themselves.   It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn. It is killing by burning, scrapping, dismembering, vacuuming the child until its dead. That is every abortionists goal. The unborn has to be killed in the womb….not outside. This picture is accurate and shows abortion. Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic….it puts action to reality…it gives a face to what they condone. And what they condone is barbaric.  This is a surgery or procedure that is like none else on earth. Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.",1,2
1029,"I would be more than happy answering this question.  1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   There is always adoption. In most communities there are Crisis Pregnancy Centers that help women in situations like this. Free medical care…etc.  2. What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have? You have no right. Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things. There are families with drug and alcohol users, families who are poor, divorced…no family skates through life with no trials. Support is an excuse…because there is adoption and there are services that help women who have no money.   How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted. Wow. Hitler had the same mentality and views as your imply here. My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives. ARe you perfect? Maybe you should have been aborted…????? ARE you good looking, a millionaire….problemless? I doubt it.   What you imply here is outrageous. If babies would be better off dead…because they will be in heaven…then lets kill all children…there would not be a population problem is we did this…we would go extinct.   Let me ask you this. Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?",1,2
1030,"Yes I have. Abortion is wrong because it takes a life. The child in the raped woman's body…how is he/she at fault. Why should they lose their life because an act of violence happened to another living human being. Do you think two wrongs make a right? Rape was wrong….but abortion solves and takes away that problem? Its two acts of violence….the rape and the abortion.  Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?  Red Herring? It is fact and she has openly talked about her life. Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?  Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness, death, dying, troubles? Wow. Nothing bad happened to them. Incredible.   You skipped over cleverly my question let me reword it. Do you think that mentally challenged, physically challenged people should have been aborted? If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…..should they be aborted? yes or no  You certainly don't like answering questions when your back is against the wall do you…lmao.  I will against ask the question……Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?  Your lack of an answer…speaks volumes. LOL",1,2
1031,"You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.  You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.  Curious …..what situations is abortion wrong?  I have explained why abortion is wrong. It is not right for anyone to be able to kill something like abortion does…on a completely separate human being. I give it personhood….it is immoral. Taking a life like this is wrong. In war…two sides are fighting. Our servicemen and women sign up to go…they take risks. What risk does an unborn take? How can you possibly compare the two? You can't. War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL  So if someone killed your little girl or boy….you would not consider their lives sacred, special,….that their lives deserved sanctity?   It would be just Oh well……Ill have another kid.  The mother has rights…she had a right to have sex. She had a right to take the risk. But once a life has started….those rights should be put on the back burner until the child is born…then she also has rights to decide what to do with it. Keep it or adopt it out. Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…THAT YOU HELPED CREATE. AFter conception it is a separate human being…this is a scientific fact. A FACT. You propose to kill human beings…you say this is ok.   How barbaric and cold is that?  It should not matter whether the child will make it or not. If it doesn't and dies…then it was meant to be. Abortion is premeditated killing. Nothing spontaneous about it….you hire someone to kill someone…in this case the unborn child in the womb….who was invited in BY THE MOTHER, BUT HER RISK HER CHOICE.  I gee the Oprah example to show that…the argument by pro-aborts does not hold water. Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….  I GOT NEWS FOR YA……WE ALL FACE TRIALS. Oprah did in her life…and she overcame them. She grew up in a home that was not healthy or functional. To kill because you think someone MIGHT FACE A SIMILAR LIFE…is still wrong. So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You said this….""Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy   and self-consciousness.""   Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.  What does a newborn have that it didn't have five minutes before in the womb before it was born? LOL  Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body…and THEN YOU TELL HER SHE CANT ABORT IN LATER MONTHS? LOL",1,2
1032,"""The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.""  I want to take issue with what you said here.  How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals. I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.  Most women suffer silently if they have had abortions. This is not acceptable table talk at the dinner table or any table for that matter. Not many woman I know want to talk about what they did…who wants friends and family to know they killed a family member? No women do not report it…they don't talk about it. They try to FORGET IT.   This is not so easy. Last Sunday was Right to Life Sunday and our pastor gave a sermon on this. I can only imagine how many women were sitting there who had had an abortion and were suffering. Its why most pastors won't even touch the issue. Lets not make women feel bad. Lets hide it.  I work with a group Silent No More. We minister to women and families and friends who are suffering from abortions. Abortion affects not just the woman but her family…that is if she tells them she had an abortion. I have worked in this field for over ten years…and the stories and tears I have seen…is unbelievable.   Do not say women do not suffer. That is propaganda that pro-aborts, that Planned Parenthood wants people to think. If you asked the majority of women however if they think about it…regret it you would be shocked…that is if they had the guts to admit again they had one.   Its funny isn't it that…the most performed surgical procedure in America…and we don't talk about it. How many women tell family and friends…hey can't meet for lunch going to get an abortion.  Does not happen for all the obvious reasons.",1,2
1033,Your right here…..abortion is not a disgusting thing to people who have no compassion and have hard hearts. You obviously are one of them.   I can only imagine what other moral issues you find acceptable. I don't even want to know.,1,2
1034,If its so disgusting then why do you want it legal so people can do it? You stand in the same line as they do if you want it legal. There is no moral difference. You simply do not want protection for the unborn. How is this pro-life?  You state abortion is disgusting and that its gross irreverence for life…  You can't' be both. You can't want abortion legal and then claim your pro-life .  Your position is morally baffling.,1,1
1035,You are pro-abortion in every sense of the word. You just don't like to think of yourself in those terms. It implies something not nice.  You oppose legal protection for unborn children. If you wanted protection you would be pro-life.   That is not the case. What gets me are the people like yourself who say abortion is gross and ugly…..yet sit back and do nothing about changing law…..BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT THE LAW CHANGED.  Now that is morally baffling.,1,1
1036,"I am antichoice abortion. I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   If not then you enslave someone from doing something with their body. So you are anti-choice. So why do you fault me for being antichoice abortion?  I believe that science established the fact that the life in the womb is a separate human being from its mother. It does not share organs…does not have the same finger prints…etc. It is simply using the space to grow. It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother. It was her body also that invited the sperm into the space where conception took place. She is the one who knew what could happen….when she had sex. She took the risk. She should be responsible for what happens. It was her risk and fault…not the unborns.   I am forced everyday to do things I don't want to do. I hate seat belts…but I am forced by law to wear them. And texting in the car. Who should have the right to stop someone from doing this if they are careful. Its their phone…its their car. THEY TAKE THE RISK JUST LIKE THE WOMAN DOES WHEN SHE HAS SEX. We all live by rules many we don't like. I do not like abortion.  I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear. Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion. Pro in the sense THEY WANT ABORTION LEGAL….WHICH MEANS BABIES DIE. That is not pro-life…even if they would never get one themselves. I go to conventions and seminars with Right to Life. If you stood up and said…..""I am pro-choice but I am against abortion""…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.  Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?  I am not happy. I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold. For me its like looking into the eyes of evil.  Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position. Try it…..",1,1
1037,"You know what puzzles me……?  Here we have a picture that the pro-abort side DOES NOT WANT SHOWN. It factually is true and this is how a later term abortion happens. It happens the same way however in earlier abortions…the baby is just smaller. But never the less body parts still are dissected and torn from the fetus alive…until it is dead. So this is the face of abortion…FACT.   What gets me is this. Most everyone here I presume is pro-choice. Why?  They believe that the woman should have the rights to her body and that its a personal decision that only she can make. She should not be burdened by carrying something she does not want…and she may do this for any reason. Abortion should be legal so that if she decides to kill her baby she can.   So why does this picture…upset pro-aborts/choicers? If they embrace abortion for all the right reasons….then what is so wrong with it?   Is killing a living human being bad? No says the pro-choice side. Why the emotion from this side for being called pro-abortion? Is there something your not telling us? Certainly you don't advocate something you find immoral..right?   If abortion should be legal…because its the woman body her decision. Then how many of you would agree that even late term abortions like this….are ok?  LOL  How many of you would want to enslave her in later terms just because you find late term abortions repulsive and wrong. The baby looks more like a baby….and gee, just tugs on your heartstrings doesn't it…..sigh.",1,2
1038,"But you are wrong…it is you just don't hear about it. And if you are pro-choice then…what is the problem with it? Do you not want to be put on the spot during the Super bowl if someone in your group says wow…who could be for that? Then you would have to say well I condone it…I am pro-choice? Or you could sit there and hide your opinion and just agree so you don't look bad.   I don't have to look it up. Have you ever heard of Tiller…the doctor that was killed for doing late term abortions? He did them like this as do clinics all over the country. YOU DONT HEAR ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY HIDE IT…IT IS ILLEGAL. It is done. Last year alone two late term abortion clinics were shut down…one in LA and one in New Mexico. It is done and you are very naive if you think it isn't. And as I said…..is there something wrong with abortion Saurbaby? If you are pro-choice it should be legal because your position stands on the fact that no woman should have to carry something if she does not want to do it. That would enslave her. So if she wants an abortion say at eight months….it should be ok.   The picture is accurate and true. You yourself said in this post….""Abortion is not done like that ANYMORE."" Which….LOL implies that you know it was done and the picture is accurate.  Did you know that in that tiny clump of cells…22 days after conception when most women don't even know they are pregnant…the heart starts beating. Yea…in that blob you think is nothing.  What is the abortionists goal?",1,2
1039,"It is a choice. And when abortion was illegal the majority of women had their babies. Less women got pregnant because they knew that abortion was really not an option…it was hard to find illegal abortion clinics and doctors that would perform them. So they thought twice about having sex. Now abortion is an option and many women use it as birth control.  You can't be both. You either want abortions legal…or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal. One thing your not…Pro-life…not if you want abortion legal. Thats like child abuse. Looking away you know its wrong but its your neighbors right to do it. Do you help the children no.   Now rape is a serious violent act and it is wrong. But that which is created is still a child, innocent at that. It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act…and abortion is the next. The mother chooses to violently end her childs life.   I have known people who have used birth control but still got pregnant. Accidents happen…but, you still are taking the risk…because no birth control is 100% effective…..unless you get fixed. We live in a sexually active society. If more women are keeping their babies because they are not looked down on by society anymore. More couples live together today than get married. TV, radio, magazines, movies…..in general foster the idea that if it feels good it can't be that bad. We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant. Kids know about sex earlier than ever today. So I highly doubt that if women have sex they don't know what can happen. Accidents happen…and women know that.   It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for. So you help to paint a bullseye on every child who is conceived in its mothers womb.",1,1
1040,"( Headdesk )  I hate these For/Against debates about abortion. Abortion is NOT one sided! Both radical sides of the argument are full of idiocy! Which of course is why I have a totally neutral opinion. Abortion is totally okay up until a certain, and totally unacceptable after a certain point.",1,1
1041,"Nothing is one sided. There is good and evil, but mostly gray. There is neutrality in  everything . How can you say there is no neutrality? That's naive.  I don't sit the fence, I say the radical opinions are idiotic, and it's foolish to not think they are. To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.   Why do I say that? Well, simple: humans cannot judge humanity with our mere senses. The fact that we can't is the reason racism and fascism and sexism exists in the first place. You can't judge humanity by yourself and neither can I. Nobody can.  But we're supposed to be beyond that sort of thing. Open-thought and technology accelerate us as a race. We're better then to take radical sides anymore.   With that said, what constitutes a human being? Most would agree that a consciousness, a soul, constitutes a human being. We can't measure a consciousness without machines, but we can still do it.   If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.   It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.   You cannot measure it's soul without measuring it's consciousness, so you cannot presume that it has a soul before it has a consciousness, but you  can  presume that is has a soul during and after it has a consciousness because you can measure it's consciousness.  Therefore, abortion is moral up until the fetus develops a consciousness. Afterwards, it is a human being and cannot be aborted. If it is aborted at that point, it is murder. Before then, it's not.   To say that one radical side is right over the other is foolish. Both sides are illogical and presumptuous. Neutrality is the only logic and morality.",1,1
1042,"I said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. But even rape has neutrality in it. Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler, a murderer of innocent people. Is that evil? No. Fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral.   There is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. You can't, I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you.  It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? No. And yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. Have you no imagination? Here's a scenario: You are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. Is that love wrong? Just because there is an age gap? Not necessarily. Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are.   What Hitler did WAS wrong, did I dispute that it wasn't? But in fact, it was gray in some areas. Why? Because he saved Germany. He did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil.  The 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. Yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. Even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil.  It's meant to be contradictory. I don't believe in either radical, I trust in the balance between the two which I explained. Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time? I'm not pro-choice, I'm just on this side of the debate. The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point.  Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Also, yes, I am God. I am a Pantheist. But that has nothing to do with this debate.  If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist. Duh.  No, I am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. The point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human.  Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. So no, I am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean.  Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. Though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. What is wrong with you?",1,1
1043,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",1,1
1044,"That's not what I said. Typical... turning my words into something they are not. How polite of you. What I said is that neutrality is logical because this world is made of almost nothing but it. If you kill a man who attacks you for no discernible reason, how good or evil is that action if he is a devoted, loving father? The fact is that there is little good and evil in the world, something that churchmouse did not seem to understand, thus my explanation of it and neutrality to her.  What you don't understand is that to be neutral isn't to not make a decision. To be neutral is to be aligned in between two extremes. Just because you are aligned in between two extremes does not mean you do not make decisions based off of your alignment. You're not thinking of neutrality, you are thinking of laziness. Or stupidity, perhaps. And for the record, you don't know how I treat my own children. How I treat them has nothing to do with abortion, nor my point on neutrality.   You are correct, you did make an argument of logic, though what you forgot to include in said argument was a wide variety of points that prove that abortion are wrong. If you are saying that abortion is wrong only because it stops people from facing the consequences of unprotected sex, then you are forgetting that there are  far  too many reasons for and against abortion for that to be your leading point.",1,1
1045,"Right, because you post sources for everything you say and all of your opinions are based upon supported facts! ;D",1,1
1046,"Pro-choice is full of idiocy because unlimited rights in every situation is, of course, ridiculous. You're right, you're supposed to be able to be punished for your actions if you do something stupid. To have the rights to avoid responsibility for every last mistake you make is an abandonment of logic.  Pro-life is full of idiocy because most of the time it is based on the notion that the second a sperm and egg meet and become a single complete cell, they become a human being with all of the same rights of a human being. That is an abandonment of logic.  Logical, truly moral balance is found on middle ground between the two extremes.",1,1
1047,"It is life, this is true, but it is not a human being. You said yourself, it has 'potential' to be a human being, and I agree, but this alone does not make it a human being until a certain stage in the pregnancy. The abandonment of logic is to consider it  more  then just a potential human being.",1,1
1048,"Your link is the second step in my argument. I'll get to it soon.   But how...   Simple, the same reason a single sperm or a single egg cell are not human beings.    It seems to me...   Well that's how it seems to you. It seems to me that just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it human.   Just because...   Actually, depending on the stage in the pregnancy, it isn't a human being when the heart isn't beating. Then again, I believe the heart starts beating after it's become a human being during the pregnancy; I'm not exactly sure of the minuet time-frame specifics of most pregnancies.   By that logic...   You're assuming I'm totally pro-abortion, which I am not. My logic is not yet fully explained to you. Very simply, do I believe that fetus in the photo is a human being? Well, I'm fairly sure it is, but I'd need a doctor with a very expensive machine to tell me whether is it or not.",1,1
1049,"Give me the link again, and if it doesn't have evidence that a newly fertilized egg has a human  soul , then you're lying. Saying something is a human being based on the flesh is not scientific, meaning you're full of opinionated shit. And so is the ""scientist"".  I have obviously done far more research on this topic then you, since you are content with sitting on a radical belief. It doesn't matter if something is alive, that does not make it human. A mushroom is alive. Grass is alive. But we still step on mushrooms and mow our lawns.  You haven't been listening to my point from the beginning. You don't listen... listen listen listen. I know exactly what the pro-life stance on abortion is, but you know nothing about what my stance is, because you obviously have not been paying attention even slightly. That, or you're completely insane.  There is a moral middle ground for  everything . I am not sitting on the fence. I am not pro-abortion because I don't believe in abortion after a certain stage in the pregnancy. Who the heck am I? No one. But a doctor can tell her when her fetus has  brain waves . A doctor can tell her, therefore, when a fetus is a  conscious human being . If she cannot see the logical difference between killing something that is conscious and something that is not conscious, then I would never trust her to know what the difference is between smashing a rock and killing a newborn baby. So no, it's not personally what I think even a little. It's basic logic that you seem to lack or deny out of faulty religious principle.   I am going to point this out one last time about my observations over abortion:  science does not prove that a human soul beings at conception . Science does, on the other hand, prove that a consciousness emerges at a certain stage in the pregnancy. The soul is not measured by existence, it is measured by the brain, by the conscious being. To say that a human has a soul because it's flesh exists is like saying that an  ant  has a soul because it crawls on your kitchen floor, but that's not going to stop you from  murdering it with Raid .   This is very balanced thinking. The fact that I don't believe in the mother's rights after a certain point instead of at all times means I am not one-sided, like you. If I am not one-sided, then what am I? I'm in between the two radical opinions because neither of them is balanced. Pro-choice is hypocritical and pro-life is hypocritical. Both are illogical because neither factor in circumstance. You want to know why my observations of abortion are so confusingly in between? Because I factor in circumstance and humanity. You do not.   I have not once disputed that a fetus is not alive, I have disputed that it is not human until a certain point. So, I'm going to say this one last time:  you have yet to prove that a fetus is human before is has a consciousness . You dodge and you block and you spew meaningless jargon at me that has no relation to anything I'm saying. You haven't proved me wrong once;  once .  Now stop spewing crap at me and explain why a fetus,  logically , has a soul at every stage of the pregnancy, consciousness or not. Only when you can  logically  prove that a fetus has a soul before it has a consciousness that you will ever come anywhere near proving me wrong.   So far, you have said nothing that means anything towards disputing me. Maybe you're dumbfounded and not paying attention to a single word I'm saying. But I've pretty much explained it thoroughly, so if you can't get it this time, it's obvious that you're extremely slow.",1,1
1050,"You forget that she's from the UK. The British don't tend to randomly share such personal information with random people, whether it's kidnehy surgery or abortion. (Yes, that stereotype was satirically intended for the purpose of pointing out that her country is different then ours.)  That's hypocritical for you to say. In fact, that's contradictory. ;) If the circumstances don't matter to you, then the circumstance of the mother dying on the table shouldn't matter either. You're a big fat hypocrite. REAL pro-life people I've talked to think the mother should  die .  Circumstance is the only thing that matters in anything, ever. If you value  all  life, then you are an idiot. If you value all  human  life, then you're supposed to treat them with empathic logic, the only logic of morality. People are numbers in the end. If you don't treat them like numbers and instead like individuals, more will be lost then gained. You can't just say that it's right to let the mother die because abortion is murder, because that, by definition, is incentive to murder. If you value all  human  life, you can't say that euthanazia is right, but letting a mother die in childbirth is euthanazia. According to your logic, you'd have to choose in between murder and murder.   And that's why circumstance is the only factor that matters.   What if a doctor like you is in that situation described above? What is he supposed to do? What he's SUPPOSED to do is abandon your false logic! It is not logic because it does not factor in the unpredictable variable that is circumstance! If you want to do the right thing, you have to think of everyone and everything as a whole, not  one  specific factor in the equation! You can't solve for x in an xy equation without also solving for y!   Your logic tries to solve for  just  x.  As you can see, that is impossible. That's why I don't agree with either radical side of this debate. If you really care about people and life, neither should you.",1,1
1051,"Ha ha ha, I'm not at all. You don't get it. I'm talking about her point of view in the UK. People don't talk about it because medical history is personal and the British are a different personality then us over medical information all together. You apparently aren't friends with many British people like I am. In the United States, you are correct to a small extent, but don't think it's the same way in the UK just because you want it to be. It's not.  Wow, you're a hypocrite AND a sexist. Ha ha, now things just got interesting. You're a hypocrite because what you said wasn't pro-life and it was contradictory to itself. You said 'circumstance doesn't matter unless the women is dying on the table'. That's hypocrisy. Hypocrite.   Also, why does my opinion not matter in the case of abortion? Because I don't feel what an abortion is like? That's a very sexist thing to say. You're right when it comes to dead beat fathers, but they wouldn't give an opinion in the first place. I have the right to my opinion and half of the decision over the abortion my wife may or may not receive for the same reason that my wife ALSO has the right to her opinion and half of the deicsion over the  kidney donation  I may or may not do! You have a problem if you think neither have those rights in that situation. In fact, you're sexist if you think I don't deserve an opinion in that situation. Sexist.   My opinion is nothing like that. How is it like that? You're saying things that have absolutely no substance... back them up. Never once have I said that I know what it's like to have an abortion or how much it feel or hurts or damages. So, what merit is this 'you have no right' argument, other then to be sexist, hm?  I called you one name in the previous comment. I called you it because you deserve to be called it. You said something that was hypocritical. So I pointed out that you are a hypocrite, because you are indeed a hypocrite. That doesn't compare to you calling me a butcher, murderer, pro-murder, illogical, humanist, pro-abortion... all of which are untrue. Making you a SUPER-hypocrite, therefore. You think I'm loosing? Really? You haven't replied to half of my big arguments because you have no counters, and so far, you have only replied with meaningless jargin that proves no point. Like now, you say my worldview is pathetic because I called you one name. How so? I called you a name that is true. It's not like I called you a cunt, which I didn't; in fact, I haven't used a single profane word to describe you.   Now, explain to me in a sensible manner why my worldview, not humanism, you namecaller, is pathetic and devoid of real happiness, without the use of senseless jargon. I believe, in relation to abortion, of a balance between two illogical and extreme beliefs. Whatever you think, I am no humanist just because you say I am, namecaller. I called you a hypocrite because you said something hypocritical. Humanism is a belief system that you assume I follow in it's entirety, which I do not. Namecaller.   You don't believe in euthanasia or the death penalty? Well, that just shows how the comment 'No circumstance matters unless she's dying' is still hypocritical. Hypocrite.

Well, you're right about that, but that doesn't make your beliefs any less illogical in relation to the grand scheme of good and evil. That's what happens when you take a radical opinion. You don't think about everyone, you just think about a specific direction of people.  I don't care only about myself. How do I only care about myself, you hypocrite? That is such a malicious thing for you to say, and it is totally untrue. You know, you're only digging your hole of hypocrisy deeper and deeper.

Because pro-life and pro-choice are idiotic. People can say they're pro-life because they don't know what else to say, but if they take a neutral stance they're better off then being rigidly pro-life.  I'll admit it's silly for them to call themselves pro-life when they are not, but they're still being smart to try and go for a middle man.

I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    The point is that it isn't a choice that you make. You are able to process the decision now because you have a mind. A foetus has no mind. It isn't complete, it cannot think like you can.   Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.    It's basic biology. A developing brain is less sophisticated than an adult one, or child one. You take for granted this fact, that the brain develops in stages and each stage has limitations before the progression to the next. An infant cannot understand abstract concepts. A child cannot understand sexuality. A foetus is not aware like we could consider it. It isn't a child agonising over death.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.    If you have nothing well-thought-out to say, then do not speak. This is a debate and thoughtless statements are not appreciated.  Also, learn your place. You have no possession of the female gender. Theirs is not your body to command over and their life is not yours to play fate with.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it. yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her, you be the one to watch it as it dies, if it isnt alive then why bother?   A child needs love, attention, and it needs to be wanted. Children who are neglected and abused may become criminals. They become broken so they resort to crime and display emotional problems.  Family planning allows us to prevent unwanted children from entering the world.  I feel nothing towards foetal death. It isn't a baby. A baby's death is lamentable because of wasted innocence. A foetus dying has no bitterness because it isn't a person, but a thing which may only be doted upon by those who are not educated enough to know better.   We can only see thing's as human if they breathe talk and walk? Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable. I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   What defines humanity is a philosophical question which I assure you has few absolute answers. Biology suggests that we form in stages, with our minds truly mature in women at her late teenage years, in men at his early twenties. This suggests that you are not fully human until that point, for you are still growing into adulthood. A simpler definition would be that what defines humanity is our identity. We form an identity as we gather memories in this world and reflect upon them to grow. In either definition, a foetus isn't fully human because it is still growing and unable to have identity.",1,1

It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.

That is why there is no problem with it.   Doesn't everything deserve a chance?   Rationally speaking, no. Life has limited resources, and one of those resources is family. Only so many loving, positive families exist, and abortion prevents a a child from being raised as a burden. Why would you want a child to be raised in a family that was unprepared? Why should a child exist in a loveless or incompetent family? Why should a child become an orphan? Children need deep emotional bonds to become good people. You are supporting a belief that causes inconvenient children to roam the world, growing up into social problems and criminal elements.   The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it.    That's because a foetus isn't self-aware. It's a protohuman, it may be alive but it isn't aware of itself.   That's not fair to just say ""I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it.""    I believe the abortion issue of today evolved with the far right's displeasure of reduced gender roles brought on by feminism. Abortion is the ultimate sign of a woman's ownership of her body. Something that was traditionally left up to chance is now within her control, and a man can no longer force her to become a mother who stays at home, giving up her dreams. It is her choice now, too. I think that abortion is one of those emotional issues which everyone has a feeling about, but as a matter of private thought, yet politicians capitalised upon it as a means of dividing people and pulling them to support a movement they might otherwise ignore.   In other words, abortion like pregnancy is a private issue that is frankly none of our business when it concerns someone else. The reason we keep it legal is so that a woman may choose to exercise control over her body should the need arise.",1,1

This is a human being:   http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring08/ images/amazing_human_being_01.jpg    This is a foetus:   http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/06/ foetusREX010606_228x188.jpg    It has no mind. It has no awareness. It is a burden to someone else. This is why abortion exists.",1,1
1074,What if this was you? What if somebody right now was deciding whether or not to let you live or die?     It would not matter because I would not exist yet to object. A foetus has no identity. It isn't aware of what is happening.,1,1
1075,"The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.   You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.  For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.  For the rest of us, I suppose that holding a person's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature, is frankly ghastly.   The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.   Just to set the record straight, I have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis. Quite frankly, the newborn brain is still simple enough that I see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason. I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   Creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us. Further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother, since it is her body, and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind.   Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.  Have you ever seen a foetus?",1,1
1076,"Yes personal responsibility is a terrible thing...something we should never expect of anyone...   I'll be more blunt. It isn't your responsibility to teach others moral lessons that involve contracting fatal diseases, or ruining their lives. Such behaviour is vindictive and arrogant.   How subjectively arbitrary, you think your opinion here gives weight to your argument? Interesting.   It isn't arbitrary. It aligns with law.   Semantics, depends which nation you live in.  OK Abortion is killing, pure and simple...  Have I seen a foetus?  What a stupid question...what relevance is that?   Being against killing isn't much of an argument. We kill every day. As far as I and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned, killing a foetus is little different from killing an Apple when you made cider.",1,1
1077,"That is your subjective opinion, I on the other hand disagree.  I think my 'lesson' is entirely valid...personal responsibility is very important.   Then you are psychotic.   What law, of which nation?  Besides laws can be changed.   The United States.   An apple is a fruit and is not a multi cellular organism, such as a human foetus.   Apples are multicellular. They are communities of plant cells. They are living organisms.   I do not kill human foetuses everyday and that is what we are discussing..not apples or plums or oranges...LOL   I have as much emotion for a foetus dying as an apple or plum being consumed. They are on the same level of self-awareness (or lack thereof).",1,1
1078,"I care not about the laws of the United States, I am not american (thankfully) thus subjective parochial american laws mean nothing to me and have no bearing on the comparative ethics of abortion.   You live in Ireland then? Otherwise there is equivalence.   Such ignorance...do apples breed?  Do they react to stimuli?   Seeds may produce trees. Apples are extremely heterozygous and may not breed true.   Do they feed?  Do they excrete?    http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/4/670.abstract    http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/                                       2/159.abstract    Apples have metabolism.

Apples react to light and photosynthesise.   http://www.springerlink.com/content/ t310918x8gxqr567/     You are psychotic...and I feel the same way about anyone who harms the defenceless... ;)   No, I just don't care for that which doesn't feel. Do you defend plush toys?",1,1
1079,"You do not get the point.  Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   If the law changes, it still doesn't change that birth is a distinct and unambiguous process separating the foetus from the newborn (also, I am aware of cesarean section, I still consider this birthing).  In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word ""unique"" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.",1,1
1080,I think you have missed my basic point.  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana...so your comparisons are utterly absurd.   Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds).,1,1
1081,"Nonsense the foetus has a central nervous system fruit do not.   A nervous system is required to feel, but without a proper mind, one in development it isn't feeling anything we might consider human.   Secondly one is animal the other is plant.   Plants have systems which are alike our nervous system, merely simpler and with different purpose.",1,1
1082,I repeat!  Plants do not have central nervous systems...foetuses do.    http://ds9.botanik.uni-bonn.de/zellbio/ AG-Baluska-Volkmann/plantneuro/ neuroview.php     Brain waves have been recorded by EEG (electro- encephalograph) in the human embryo 40 days after fertilisation   But not a mind... this is what I was arguing against.,1,1
1083,I repeat for the benefit of the poster of this link.  PLANTS DO NOT POSSESS CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS.  You seem to have some difficulty accepting this simple premise...so please shove your link up your unscientific behind.   So you know better than experts in biology who study plants for their career.  How arrogant.  You might notice that I'm not wasting time typing long replies. This is because you are too emotional to argue anything of substance. You are too easy to dispute.,1,1
1084,"Utter unsubstantiated nonsense.  Or Bullsh t as you americans say.  Unless of course you know something most neurologists and other medical scientists do not? *  What does it mean to feel? Beyond simple taxis and kinesis what is there to the experience? There are emotional consequences for the stimuli, there is introspection towards the stimuli, there is the actual feeling itself, and there may be long-term memory of the event.  I do not believe it possible that a foetus has developed all of these aspects of feeling yet, when an infant appears to lack them except in the most rudimentary stages.",1,1
1085,"Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.   So... asexually reproducing life isn't sacred now? In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.  Fruit cells envelop seeds (usually) and they are alive. The only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall. Both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life. In the case of a fruit, the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs. In the case of a foetus, it may grow into a human. Both have this potential, but they are not presently realised.   This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...   I never said that apples were independent life forms, but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it.  Also, if you want to get into the biology of it, the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells, a relationship which evolved over many millions of years. Multicellular life is, in a sense, many cells working together through evolved inter-dependence. So in a historical sense, yes, your testes have cells which are animals (animals need not be multicellular) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter-dependent.",1,1
1086,"So no one can love an adopted child?   We have enough children that are not being taken up in homes and families, and you just want to exacerbate this.",1,1
1087,You could argue that a human being is a composite of billions of animals working together...so what?   It is a commentary on your statement.   How does that prove that a foetus is no more special than a Plum?   Without an identity it is as generic.   A foetus is human...a Plum is not.   So? This isn't a comment of any use. It's accepted that a human is not a plum.,1,1

1089,Plants and indeed fruit do not become functioning human beings.   Foetuses do not grow into trees. I guess I better not care about them because only trees are sacred.,1,1
1090,"So trees are more important than human beings in your view?  Fair enough that explains your pro elective abortion stance.  How subjectively illogical.   You merely argued that one is not the other, you did not dispute similarities.",1,1
1091,"even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life   A couple critical points:  This    http://blog.bioethics.net/baby.jpg   Is not equal to this   http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain/ uploads/1/foetus.jpg    Or this   http://topnews.net.nz/images/Embryo.gif   A baby is not a foetus or an embryo. The words are not interchangeable. When a woman is pregnant, a baby isn't sitting in her womb for nine months already developed. Calling it a baby is a way to emotionally hijack the topic. It's like calling hamburgers ""puppies"" in order to make us vegetarians.  Second point: A foetus is not a life. It hasn't lived in the outside world yet and formed an identity.",1,1

If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   They are not children. Words have a distinct meaning. Children are born, and have minds of their own. A foetus has no mind. It is incomplete, unaware. I think that you need to come to terms with your nature, that like all life we are mechanisms which are built in stages. A foetus is a stage of human without a mind, or awareness of itself. Killing it is like killing a doll.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   That's what orphans are for.   When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   A foetus isn't a child. A foetus cannot be murdered. You need to learn your place, let women make their own decisions without sticking your nose into it.",1,1
1095,"It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is ""all"" or ""most"" or even ""vital"" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.   Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion.   I am out-maneuvering you. You only think one step at a time, but I'm several steps ahead of you. Learn to concede when you are off topic and we'll get along fine.   Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us.   How young are you? A teenager? You sure are wide-eyed if you think law and the justice system are about truth.  Juries are made up of peers, average blokes. Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me? Argue in a way that is clear, has few red herrings, and is rational rather than an appeal to feelings.",1,1
1096,"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?   A person with Alzheimers has started to lose their awareness, their brain is literally being destroyed. We grant them this exception out of mercy.  However refer to what I said before: laws are not based on reality, but what people feel ought to be. I don't care about what law says.   Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?   When you kill cell, you kill life, but not A LIFE. Same with early-stage abortion.   You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.   I answered you before on this topic: laws are not required to be consistent with each other. That one is allowed and the other forbade is not representative of our stance that a woman ought to have control over her body, but is representative of our legal system's inconsistency.   If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.   I did not say this. I said that how much it is performed has no bearing on whether it should be illegal. This is about granting a woman the ability to terminate her pregnancy, a very personal choice that affects her body. It isn't about punishing women who have abortions commonly.   Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.   Since you're being obtuse, I'll explain this to you explicitly:  Deaths caused by surgical abortion in a hospital (where trained physicians and emergency equipment reside): some number.  Deaths caused by surgical abortion at home (since abortion is illegal and the woman has to operate on herself): higher than the previous number.   Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.   Again, explicit language:  Abortion exists to end unwanted pregnancies. Your concern over repeat abortions is based on personal feelings of morality and a desire to punish irresponsible women, it is irrelevant to the aim of abortion: ending unwanted pregnancies.  Should we ban condoms because some people have dozens of partners and are avoiding the consequences of disease? No. Condoms exist to prevent pregnancy.   It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.   Sorry to disappoint you, but your arguments are all over the place. You have no direction and I have to keep you on topic.  You're free believe that you'll somehow ""beat me,"" but if this is your best caliber of argument style, you'd better just ask me to help you learn how to improve your debate tactics.   Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?   Of course I understand your questions. I can tell you're off topic because whenever you ask a question that appeals to an authority or my emotions rather than the issue at hand, a woman's right to end her pregnancy and the scientific fact that most aborted foetuses cannot be self aware, I know you're obscuring the topic.   I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.   You're still but a child, and could learn a few things from seasoned adults who know much more about these topics than you.   Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.   And you don't think that critical thinking on my behalf has prevented me from engaging your red herring topics, hmm?  Winning an argument is real life has little to do with the truth. That's why politicians engage in petty topics and the news is full of mud slinging. That's why in the United States, half the population believes the earth is under 10000 years old.  You might have had a busy few years of your life, but don't forget that you're still young and have a lot more to learn. Now please, proceed in the debate but focus of the issue of foetal awareness, and compare it to the woman's level of awareness. Also look into the dangers of illegal abortions, and discuss the societal effects of forced pregnancy on unprepared mothers.",1,1
1097,"Really? So how come when a person commits suicide the state has every right to stop that person from doing it? Why don't you answer that then?   It's because a bunch of angry and sad victims of a suicide decided to give government that right. It has no bearing on a person's autonomy, however.   Why do you keep saying her body. The fetus is inside her body but not her body. The fetus has a completely different DNA and blood type than the mother and if the blood type of the fetus comes in contact with the blood type of the mother it can be fatal.   Parasites, bacteria, and protists all have different DNA from us but still reside within us. We have the final say over their existence because they reside in our bodies.",1,1
1098,"Any Federal law on abortion is inherently illegal because the Federal government has no authority to regulate abortion. The States individually have the power to. I would be ecstatic if every State in the Union outlawed abortion, just like murder is outlawed.     Abortion isn't murder. A foetus is not a person in the meaningful sense of the word.",1,1
1099,Isn't animal cruelty a crime? Animals are technically not people. So shouldn't it apply to unborn humans when one ends their life?     Ending a life isn't cruel. Cruelty specifically refers to negligence and mistreatment like physical abuse.,1,1
1100,"If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human   It's probably because a pregnant woman is seen as being more vulnerable, and motherly, so killing such a person is especially heinous.",1,1
1101,"The vulnerability of a woman is completely irrelevant. So, vulnerability is your justification for double homicide of a pregnant woman with a fetus, yet a woman getting a abortion is not because the fetus is not human.  I am vulnerable of getting hit by a car walking the street, so should the driver of the car be charged with murder or manslaughter?   You asked why and I told you some of the potential reasoning behind it. I don't agree with it either.",1,1
1102,"For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?   I'm more interested in science, I.E. knowledge of nature, than legal rulings which are a matter of politics.  If you don't have a functioning body that can exist on its own, it follows that you lack developed organs, and even more importantly a developed brain. This means you lack awareness of your own life.  It would be nice if you researched the developmental stages of fertilisation through foetal development, and birth. Then you might appreciate the fact that while a fertilised egg is alive, it isn't a life, or at least not worthy of being granted the rights of a born human life.  The whole issue that you are so passionate about is actually over the killing of fertilised eggs and tiny, unaware foetuses.   The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?   If you're going to grant something the rights of a human simply because it is Homo sapiens sapiens, then this would extend to tissue cultures and blood as well.",1,1
1103,Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on?   I did research it.   Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law.   Law IS a form of politics. It's about appeasing many different voices on an issue by creating legislation that they can all agree on.   Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well. Whether you are dealing with science or business etc at some point you will have to abide by the instructions of the laws.   Which at some point are influenced by those with a voice in the matter.,1,1

Furthermore if you hurt a person or wound them, does that not involve a damage of the cells, tissues and or organs as well? Isn't that is why they are charged with assault or attempted murder?     You missed the point entirely. Assault isn't a crime because we care about dead cells, it is a crime because we have decided that it is bad behaviour. Same with attempted murder.",1,1
1105,"What puzzles me is the fact that a mother can have an abortion but if someone else kills the mother and the child dies in her, then that person can be slapped with a charge of double homicide.     Laws don't have to be logical or consistent.",1,1
1106,Exactly i know why i made that statement. If the fetus does not have life then why does the state and the federal government institutes a charge of double homicide if the fetus dies through the death of the mother because according to those supporting abortion the fetus does not have life. Are the laws therefore wrong?     I believe I said this.,1,1
1107,"I'm very against abortion, but I'm not stupid; I know there are times where it is a necessity. I think it should ultimately stay legal, but should be a lot more restricted. I don't see anything good from a 25-year-old going in and getting an abortion because she just doesn't want the baby.     Why should it matter to you if a person does that? That's awfully nosey and judgmental.",1,1
1108,"Most abortions that occur are before it is even a foetus. The second most likely stage aborted is that in which the foetus is barely developed, barely has a brain and only might have a heart.  The figures are roughly 50% and 30% respectively.  I support abortion because we need mothers who want their child and are prepared to raise it well. What we do NOT need are unprepared, overworked mothers giving their babies to an already flooded adoption market, or attempting to raise a child that gets less than optimal care because the mother can't be there for him.",1,1
1109,"Well yeah you are right but read up on the case which The U.S Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.   Life does not mean ""a life"" as in a person worthy of human rights.   I think that is wrong in the whole to take a life.   Don't scratch yourself then, you kill life in the form of skin cells.   How many of us would even be here today if our parents had chosen abortion for us regardless of poverty or unpreparedness.   A lot fewer, and we'd have less poverty, slums, crime and overpopulation if people aborted rather than raise a child unprepared.",1,1
1110,"Really? Give me one reason why? So are you implying that when you were in the womb of your mother you were unworthy of human rights? We are talking about the ""life of a developing human being for your information"".   Life is not ""a life"" intrinsically because it has no proper brain. A mass of cells knows nothing.  Now that I was born, I earned human rights.  Why give an unintelligent mass of tissues or cells human rights?   Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to?   I don't care about it. The court has little relevance to reality. If it was a scientific journal, I would care.   For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?   It doesn't matter if the tissue is human. When you donate a kidney, is that kidney ""a life"" or just ""life"" Hmm? A foetus isn't self-aware.  Organism is the most inclusive term for life.   That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.   What I said was a rational statement. I still support it no matter how you try to appeal to my emotions.  The simple fact is that abortion culls unwanted offspring from the population. A child should be wanted, and prepared for.  Go ahead. Try to make an argument that an unwanted child or a child raised as a burden are both GOOD things for society.",1,1
1111,"When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Doesn't matter.  In cell culture life begins after the cells separate in mitosis.  We're talking about when a foetus has independent thought and recognises that it is being killed. This is highly dubious if the foetus just barely started brain development, and barely has functioning organs.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   Different topic.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   Who cares? It's not your business. Should the number of feminist activists out there decide our choice to maintain womens' suffrage?   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   You don't actually care about the mother, so why bring this up?  It's more of a loaded question anyway because most medical procedures have a mortality rate, and are legal. Also women who undergo late-term abortion themselves are under increased risk of harm.   Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   Welcome to universal healthcare, or attempts at it anyway.   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified. Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Being a good lawyer isn't about questing for the truth, it is about defending a conclusion in a convincing way. Your conclusion is that abortion is wrong, so you'll only care about that which supports your ability to persuade others.",1,1

Your just an idiotic athiest who doesnt even know what he's talking about.     Have you ever read the bible? The biblical god has smote children on more than one occasion. The common examples are the flood (children were among those to be drowned), and the first-born of Egypt (as if a first-born child has any idea of what's going on at that age, and deserves death). Then there are battles in which the god-approved side was given the approval (blessing) to kill everyone in the opposing side, including sacking their cities, and their women and children. Also, do not forget that a kid who is disrespectful towards his or her parents is to be put to death.",1,1

Here is a link to that:  http://www.gotquestions.org/ Christian-law.html       I read it from the supposed word of god itself. The bible is very clear that Jesus said that the laws are to be obeyed until heaven and earth come together, and he fulfils his role (because it mentions heaven and earth, this means the crucifixion is apart from it).  You need to stop reading apologetics and try reading the bible, the book that is supposed to be infallible according to your beliefs, but you seem to require others to interpret it for you.",1,1

If you're debating science, you use scientific evidence. If you're debating a particular mythology, you use that mythology's canon as a reference. Is this so strange to you?  Why shouldn't I read the text literally? Because it doesn't give you answer you like? Christians are very strange this way, whenever you read the bible in a way that doesn't put your hindsight into it, or gives an answer that doesn't seem favourable, they say something like ""you're reading it literally"" but when you discuss science, or medicine, or politics, the same Christians will go right ahead ans say ""science is wrong!!! because it literally says the earth was made in six days.""  Try being consistent. If you want everything to be metaphorical, then stop saying that the earth is six thousand years old, that science is wrong, etc. If you want everything to be literal, then accept that the old testament still applies.",1,1

A lot of science is correct except evolution, the big bang, etc... Your are not a Christian at least for now so your understanding of the Bible is not as great as mine.     Being a Christian has nothing to do with it. I don't have your prejudice and theological blindness, and that is why I don't dismiss scripture that I find inconvenient, like you do. What Jesus said was quite clear but you continue to ignore it because you don't like the outcome of it being true. But hey, ignore me and Jesus on this matter, you apparently think you know more than he did when he was speaking. I guess when you're roasting in the flames of hell, you'll realise your mistake in not following the old testament.",1,1

Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.   34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.   35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.   36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.   37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.   38And he said, Go.

1123,The rough statistics are:  About 50% of abortions are before the pregnancy reaches the foetal stage.  About 40% of abortions are in the foetal stage but generally before the foetus has a heart.  About 10% are after this.,1,1
1124,"The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime..   Let me ask you a question. Are you aware of foetal development? The first four weeks after having unprotected sex, there isn't even an embryo yet. Once you have the embryo it's weeks before it even develops into a foetus, which means it is a few cells with no mind or organs. 50% of abortions happen before the woman even has a foetus inside her. Once it becomes a foetus, it's another 7 to 9 weeks before it even has a heart pumping blood. The brain is still in the process of growing. 40% of abortions happen before this point in foetal development.  You are acting emotionally when you should be detached. This is a rational situation, not an emotional one.   It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.   The unborn baby has no rights at this point. It isn't a person yet. Maybe it bothers you to think of people in a way that allows them at some point to no longer be people. Humanity doesn't suffer from abortions, the only way it could suffer is if abortions were so common that our death rate exceeded our birth rate, but this isn't the case. Morals and god are irrelevant, because those are beliefs and values that belong to you and only you, they aren't exactly shared by the women having abortions so it is a case of you imposing your god and your morals upon someone else against their will.   Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?!   The woman is taking responsibility by terminating the pregnancy. In her case it would be irresponsible to have a child that isn't wanted and would grow up lacking the support it needs.   Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?!   Protected sex can lead to pregnancy, depending upon the failure rates of the contraceptives used. Also bear in mind that the religious groups you're supporting by bringing god into this are often against contraception, and spread misinformation about it, such as ""condoms contain holes"" or ""condoms have HIV inside of them."" In this respect they are against the methods that prevent pregnancy and are against the tools that stop pregnancy as well, they seem to want women to function as baby-factories, or live a celibate lifestyle.   In the case where you were ""raped"", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever..   And then she has a child who is a reminder of the man who abused her. The child will suffer for this, and that's how you end up with a more dysfunctional society: children neglected by their mothers who wind up on the streets as thieves or gang members.   In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?!   If it's unexpected, it could be that the child will be raised in poverty because the mother can't afford it.   No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...   Yet you're here telling pregnant women what their fate should be.",1,1
1125,"Dear opponent, let me ask YOU a question.. do you even know how to debate?!  In a PROFESSIONAL debate, you do not attack any opponent but attack the argument.. I suggest you concentrate on attacking the argument instead of attacking the opponent next time..    Don't change the topic.   First of all, i do not follow any religious groups and personally i think that that information about condoms is just ridiculous and built on ignorant opinions..   You identify as Muslim, which is a religious group, and Muslim religious authorities have spread misinformation about scientific issues. The Catholics however are the primary offenders when it comes to issues of birth control misinformation.   Secondly, if i were to follow your ""style"" of debating, I'd say: You are acting irrationally and a person with no beliefs or morals.   Whether or not I have morals or beliefs is not the topic of this debate. You should be more concerned with my statement about imposing your morals and beliefs upon others.   Third of all, exactly as you said, these are my beliefs and morals and as i said only God decides the fate of all mankind, so i am simply sharing my point of view and debating. I am not forcing anything on anyone and every person is free to follow what they believe...   It is often best to not base a position on beliefs but instead form a position from data and evidence, that way you can form an unbiased solution for dealing with the problem at hand. If you take a random handful of people, and ask them how they feel about abortion, they'll give you widely varying starting times for when it is killing an innocent life, ranging from conception to birth. However there is only one true answer, and this is why science is important here.   Yes i am. In the case where a woman practices unsafe sex and does not want a pregnancy to occur, there are certain pharmaceutical drugs that should be taken between 48 - 72 hours after intercourse.. Otherwise, expect anything..   Fertilisation begins 3 weeks after intercourse. About 50% of abortions occur before the zygote becomes an actual foetus, and about 40% occur before the foetus has a developed heart.   Is she really? As i mentioned in an earlier argument, by keeping quiet she is the one allowing herself to go through all this pain.. She may be scared but if she thought of the consequences of keeping quiet - which is a pregnancy maybe - then she should realize keeping quiet isn't the wisest thing to do.. You speak up, you get help and there would be no reason for abortion anyway...   Yes. Getting an abortion is a form of personal responsibility.  Do you have trouble understanding rape? If a woman is raped, the social stigma of being pregnant is less important than the persistent reminder that your child is unwanted, forced upon you by a violent sexual act, and the offspring of the man who did this to you.  This is why using god as a basis of ethics and morality can lead to some very unrealistic solutions to simple problems.",1,1

Are you developed or undeveloped (an embryo or foetus)?  This is a binary question. You are either one or the other.  If you are a foetus (you aren't, right?), then you have no human rights.

1153,"Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent? If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience. Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep?   Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.  I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.  But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.   which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience   We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.   The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?   This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.  We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.   If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it.   This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.   In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.   The laws allowing abortion do so because it suits the women. They don't parade themselves as some sort of philosophical and moral beacon. It's mostly pragmatic.",1,1
1154,"Fetuses are capable of responding to stimuli. brain development begins in the early embryonic period or at week 5 of pregnancy  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ prenatal-care/PR00112      Brain development doesn't imply having a proper brain. It takes weeks before the brain resembles anything complex. IDX takes place around 16 weeks, and at that point the fetus has an actual brain.   later on as a fetus they can sense and respond, they can kick and punch. New born babies can recognizes the cadence of their parents language, they learn that stuff well in the womb.  http://www.babycenter.com/ 404_ is-it-true-that-babies-can-recognize- their-mothers-voice-at_10323727.bc      Alright, you demonstrated some memory and stimuli response. Assuming it is partially aware of its surroundings, it is still sub-human in its cognitive functions, meaning many simple animals are more self-aware. This allows for a rational decision in favour of the mother's right over her own body.   The future ramifications of a choice does factor in to making laws; Laws are all about that. The texting and driving laws are about the future ramifications of allowing or not allowing different groups(age based) to text and drive. The question asked is the following: Will banning it decrease crashes? the word ""will"" is a reference to the future.    You're mistaking laws which exist to prevent accidents, using statistics to back their premises, with a law which would make an operation illegal because the present life it ends would in the future be a life.  In other words, the first types of laws are about minimising the chance of damage. Chance is the operative word. The second hypothetical law is about preventing an operating from occurring because only in the future will it have ethical problems. The distinguishing feature is that one set of laws is based on chance accident prevention, the other is based upon the rights bestowed to a person only in a hypothetical future, in other words treating a present nonentity as a future person.  Going back to my condom example, the example was reducing your argument to its extremes. A condom has sperm which if allowed to fertilise an egg will become a foetus, then a child. Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.   what is meant by individuality? the zygote has its own dna pattern. it is individual, unique. I have a feeling you mean something different?   Individuality comes from the memories you have. Clones exist as part of nature, but they are still separate individuals because they experience different memories.   the first two weeks of pregnancy your not actually pregnant according to the first article mentioned in the above, there is most certainly nothing wrong with doing something with in that time period to insure you don't become pregnant.    I would argue that since we are already dealing with a known individual, the woman, who already has legal rights bestowed upon her as an individual, the decision of whose rights should prevail is fairly simple. It hasn't been established even remotely that the foetuses which are aborted in over 90% of cases are individuals.",1,1
1155,"That is NOT my reasoning.   I do not believe that you were trying to argue that wasting sperm is the same as wasting life, however I was taking your argument about potential life to its absurd logical conclusion.   I have some tests coming up so i won't respond immediately perhaps this weekend I'll write something up summarizing my position.   I look forward to reading it.   My responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making, not a argument for or against abortion themselves.   I made note of this, however I hope you realise, along with those making the argument, that it is an inherently grey issue.",1,1
1156,"Alright, I thought I'd throw this into the discussion (a logic bomb?), based upon my research I've ascertained that the majority of abortions don't even fall into the argument from sapience.   http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                       facts/after_12_weeks.html    Name your source, they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve (88% to 89% according to each).   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png    This handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10-12.  According to wikipedia, the nervous system begins development around week ten.  So, from all this information, I would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness (no brain) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they can't be aware. In this case I think the remaining 11% to 12% of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed.  I applaud you for a well-reasoned argument, but I had some ideas which weren't considered:   #1   Suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother.  Suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person (as you explained cogently, the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary, at least in a legal sense).  In this case, one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother, who has greater capacity for individuality, thought, and so-forth, right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and isn't yet granted the ""benefit of the doubt"" which the title of personhood confers.   #2   Suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of ""dead"" where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience.  In this case, all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart doesn't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen. It's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood.   #3   Suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus doesn't become a ""baby"" until say, week X (where X is some high week, like between 30 and 36).  In this case, the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion.   #4   This is basically an extended version of #1, but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience, and with high priority.  Suppose we consider the mother's rights as a person to be of paramount importance. These include a right over her body.  In this case, it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system, even if it means that around 1% of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses. We consider their sapience to be less than the woman's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live.  I'd like to address some of what you said:    AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.  BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?   I believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease, is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception. In other words, under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers, that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest, and that test reveals something to be lost. Similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met, and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example, not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer (which technically might disqualify you, but police don't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone).",1,1
1157,"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?   Yes, in the case that the lower-awareness individual cannot speak, or even comprehend their rights, for example. I suppose I should have added the qualifier that when the difference between awareness is so great that one of the individuals cannot even understand their situation, it seems reasonable to give custody of the body to the other who can.   If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.    It has all within its scope which care about foetal awareness. Some arguments are purely rights based, and see the mother as executive over her body.  With regards to AFS, I think the primary way it can be used without being seen as arbitrary is that if we find that a foetus isn't developed enough to be aware of its environment, then it isn't perceived as cruel to end its life because it isn't even aware of what it lost. I suppose this can be thought of as a stretch on the saying ""What he doesn't know won't hurt him."" This I believe is also a way to justify euthanasia (such as for deep-coma patients) because it is currently understood that they aren't even aware of their existence. So in other words under these contexts, an AFS isn't an argument for what the person will or may feel in the near future, but instead an argument used to justify a procedure as not being cruel to the recipient presently. Another strain of it arguably appears when we feel consoled when a person dies in their sleep, it is seen as less violent or cruel for that person to die while not aware of it.  An AFB would have the benefit of allowing human clones who are born without brains (beyond what is necessary for autonomic functions I suppose) to exist rationally to serve as organ hosts.  The UPA argument is the hardest to defend because as we both saw, it relies on a very grey boundary of what we feel is ""too soon"" or ""too late."" Science will be our best friend here, but we must always remember how life is rarely divided into discreet units that are easily divided.",1,1

Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person.

We know that human life technically begins at conception. That's all that needs to be said.""   For black and white thinkers such as yourself, that's all that you can understand. You lack a deep understanding of what life exactly is.  Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.  Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.   ""What I cannot stand are those who hide behind woman's rights. This is ridiculous. A little while ago, I created my very own you-tube video on this very issue. It furthers my argument""   It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body. By letting political groups take over this very important right of a woman over her own body, you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.  Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life, and unless each and every sperm is conserved for female impregnation, you were committing murder.",1,1
1167,"""This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.""   A mammalian cell, if processed to revert it back to totipotency, will grow into a zygote, and then a full human. This is like asexual reproduction. Your line of reasoning is flawed.  Now you just defined the concept of human life to include an unthinking mass of tissue cells. That cheapens what it means to be human.   ""This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.""   Consequences of a truth do not make the truth any less correct. Humans are defined by their ability to think, reason, and learn; they are defined by a culture spanning tens of thousands of years. Homo sapiens sapiens is defined by genetic relationship. Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).   ""What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.""   You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.   ""You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.""   Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.   ""The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference. ""   You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life.   ""Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.""   I ignore it because it has no rights. It isn't human. If you can't understand why a mass of cells smaller than a skin flake without a brain isn't human, then I suggest you stop arguing and read some college-level biology textbooks. You need a biology education.  But we're hovering around why you believe it is human, actually. This is probably a religious matter for you, not grounded in evidence, or logic.   ""And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.""   It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born. Stop using language that is categorically wrong in order to try and tie together a poor argument.   ""When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).""   I could argue that my religion treats as matter of faith that sperm has souls in all the cells, and that spilling sperm wastefully is murdering all those souls. I could them take up a moral platform with my church and crusade across the country trying to get masturbation banned along with pornography, and sex education.  The point to take from this is that these issues are rooted in dogma that cannot be argued away. Science already provides some clear-cut information that could be used to answer the question of whether a fetus or zygote is alive or should be properly construed as human in a legal context. Dogmatic people insist upon having beliefs however, with no evidence to support themselves beyond the emotional and intuitive appeal of their arguments.  You are the one here that is making a claim that is just assumed to be true, with no room for negotiation. You insist upon having beliefs instead of knowledge, and that is why I ridicule you.",1,1
1168,"You keep making counter-arguments based on examples outside of what I am referring to. I am not talking about any zygote. We could argue in circles all year with various banter to this degree.  I am referring to the specific zygote that results from the fertilization event after intercourse, between two human beings.   So artificially inseminated women can get abortions and clones can be aborted now. Where's your irrational bleeding heart now?   I'm not talking about an animal or genetically engineered cells or whatever crazy outlandish example that you keep pulling out of your arse.   This isn't 1950, and medical science isn't like the old Frankenstein movies of the old days. Mammalian cloning has been done many times in the past, and cell biology is a maturing science that allows the techniques I disclosed as a matter of common practice. Human cloning isn't special, it's just presently illegal.   Correction: fully grown humans are defined by that. Those humans had to go through a growing stage before they gained all of the abilities that you mentioned. During that growth, they are not fully grown but are still human life.   Again wrong. Babies and toddlers have a very simple capacity to reason, think and grow. This is afterall why they can learn language and our culture.   I am not concerned with it because the premise of my argument is indifferent with relation to the law. I am strictly dealing with morality. It use to be legal to own people. Thank goodness people didn't take the position that you are taking.   Oh yes, I remember slavery. Back in those days the Negroes were considered inferior creations, descended from god's disfavoured, cast-away people. It was thought that our moral duty was to own them because we could elevate them from their primitive culture and bring them some form of civilisation. To do otherwise, to let them have ownership of their own bodies was considered the same as allowing them to return to laziness and unproductivity.  Just another one of history's great examples of what happens when morals are imposed upon people without their consent for their greater good.   You still have failed to disprove what I said. We may have an idea, but as I stated before, technically, we do not know at what point a fetus becomes self aware. The exact moment of self-awareness is extremely important if you want to prove your argument, but you simply cannot do so. You wrote a check that your mind couldn't cash.   I thought it was obvious, but I'll try again since you seem to need help here:  At what point does a fetus respond to stimuli? At what point toes it show signs of memory? At what point does it have a central nervous system? Answer all three questions and you have a reasonable cut-off period for abortions, or at least a decent argument for one.   Sure it matters. One method is natural and another method is unnatural. I don't advocate human cloning either, even though that could result in more human life.   I'll repeat myself: unnatural versus natural means squat. Find a logical distinction, and don't rely purely on what feels good.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy   Your argument to my point that all cells have the potential for life as a fetus does, is something like ""but it's not natural!!!""   http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html  (checkmate)  I never said anything about the zygote having a soul. My position is that it is human life, therefore to end that life at any point should be considered murder.    You might want to do more research.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction    http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/                                      3500603.html     http://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5511a1.htm    In other words, PBA (Intact dilation and extraction) accounts for under 1% of abortions as of 2000, and about 5% as of 2003.  In other words your argument that babies' brains are being sucked out is a peripheral one that does not cover the main issue: the vast majority of abortions don't abort fetuses with brains, but instead embryos.   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png     I'm not concerned with you bizarre hypothetical that completely ignores that basis of which we have been debating on. At no point did I say sperm or a woman's eggs were human life. The conjoining of the 2 in a fertilization event which results in a zygote is human life. (Naturally through intercourse)   Your argument that embryos and fetuses are human lives is as absurd as my ""bizarre hypothetical"" and what's more your position is backed almost exclusively by religious agenda and not reason, again like my ""bizarre example.""  I have a question for you: if you care so deeply about embryos and young fetuses being aborted (the vast majority of abortions fall under this, after all) why aren't you setting up adoption centres that give money to couples who choose to have the child instead of abort it? Why aren't you donating time and effort to foster services? Why aren't you looking for research teams, or developing research teams to find ways to emulate a uterus for incubating embryos?  In other words at the moment you're just being an opinionated jackoff who isn't DOING anything to help the situation. You have a feeling, an opinion that somehow an embryo deserves equal rights as a human being, but you're not showing an inkling of care for the women that must suffer if your opinion had any weight.   And I ridicule you and everyone who thinks like you do. You inject new, fabricated, unrealistic hypotheticals into the debate and expect it to make sense. You can try to justify abortion all you want by bringing animals and artificial matters into the discussion but it is painfully obvious that you are searching frantically for an excuse to allow the taking of innocent human life.   I expect it to make sense because I figured that you had the intelligence to imagine your argument taken to its logical extremes. I don't have to wring my hands and sweat over the treatment of fetuses, zygotes and embryos as less than human because I genuinely do not feel anything towards them. Your attempts to elicit emotion by conflating fetuses with infants also does nothing to me because I feel no emotion towards them either. We may as well be discussing the building of a fence.",1,1
1169,"ur retarted "" black and white thinkers"" there is NO GREY AREA in this argument   Please tell me you're not a thirteen year old who has entered a debate over his head.  Of course it's grey. Babies aren't created instantaneously, they aren't above the animal kingdom and its constraints. Not all women can afford children, and more importantly foster homes are presently a suboptimal choice.",1,1
1170,"""A baby is a baby the moment the sperm meets the egg. Even though the heartbeat does not start until later, it's still a baby in my eyes.""   You should be more careful of beliefs like this, because they are a double-edged sword.  To clarify, when you believe in something as absurd as that, you are also arguing that a baby (as in, the life which has exited the womb) is equal to a single ball of cytoplasm in value and respectability.  In other words, you define the concept of ""baby"" to be so wide that the word no longer engenders feelings of protection to fetuses, or even zygotes, but instead spills over the image of an incomplete, mass of of cells with no self-awareness onto post-birth babies.  All of a sudden a baby is a mass of tissues and a brain with no true self awareness, all because you thought it sentimental to attach its name onto a mass of an obvious pre-life.",1,1
1171,"If it is not considered life when the egg is fertilized and is starting to grow, the when does it become a life. Where is the line between a incomplete mass of cells and a life.   The best line I can determine is when an offspring becomes self-aware, it is considered a life worth protecting. Since it may be that even an infant isn't fully self-aware, we could set the line to when the fetus has a sufficiently developed brain. These are all measurable to some extent. These are also both good arguments for when a fetus should be protected because they can be defended rationally.   If a woman miscarries is she wrong to fell like she lost her child.   No. It is a reasonable reaction upon losing a potential life.   Oh, and since when does self-awareness determine life, a man in a coma is still human.   A man in an early coma may regain consciousness. A man who is in a permanent coma is just an empty shell, the only rational argument that could be made for keeping that shell alive is if the brain damage could be repaired feasibly in the future. Otherwise, it is only sentimentality that is making people keep the shell alive.   Edit:   By the way, I'm matter-of-fact about these things because I have no emotional attachment to the subject. I am not trying to treat this subject flippantly, if it seems that way.",1,1
1172,"I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?   I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   Would you still laugh if the orchestrator of the largest genocide in history were to be aborted?",1,1
1173,"Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   I don't care what the Bible says God forgives and doesn't forgive. Plenty of other people don't, either.   But, just for fun:  http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   As abortion is currently legal, this is no longer an 'if' scenario. Some may say we are in dire straights as a country, but I doubt it is because the government places the rights of a conscious citizen above the interests of an unconscious fetus.   Additionally, it is judgmental and tunnel-visioned to assert that only stupid people get pregnant accidentally. Do not place yourself on a pedestal above people who find themselves in this situation.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   I think it would take a very strong mental constitution  not  to be psychologically harmed by carrying to term a pregnancy resulting from rape. I certainly admire the women who decide to do so, but women who decide not to do not deserve punishment; they deserve compassion and support because they have suffered enough.  There is no shortage of available orphans. A woman who chooses to have an abortion (for any reason, not just rape or health-related) is not cruelly ripping away some innocent stranger's dream of having a child.    When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   Earlier, it seems you implied abortion is acceptable if carrying the pregnancy to term will harm or kill the mother. Correct me if I am wrong and I will revise. Because it is for a reason you consider valid, it is no longer murder? If the answer is yes, it is still murder, why do you allow murder in some cases but not others? If the answer is no, it is no longer murder, why should your opinion be the determining one for deciding what is a valid reason to get an abortion?  She is not really stating facts, she is rambling incoherently, getting worked up, and ignoring opposing arguments. If you are her parent, you may want look around this site and see what the average discourse consists of, for the sake of both herself and the site. She may be a little young to participate.",1,1
1174,"This is nothing but hacky, sickening propoganda manufactured to instill guilt and fear in anyone considering abortion.  A one, two, three, etc. month old fetus isn't thinking  anything , much less babbling to itself about how much it loves its mommy. The most conservative estimates put fetus's the ability to feel pain at 20 weeks, a date after which abortions are incredibly rare, and likely to be for reasons of an inviable fetus or the mother's health. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_abortion_by_gestational_age_2004_histogram.svg  )  Even this assertion, notably used in pro-life legislation (  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18785-briefing-new-law-claims-a-fetus-can-feel-pain.html  ) trying to whittle down the likelihood of a woman getting abortion by any means possible (scrupulous or not) is debated by evidence from various studies that place the ability to feel pain at 24-26 weeks.   http://theweek.com/article/index/204531/                                        can-fetuses-feel-pain    The ability to form any semblance of consciousness probably comes well after pain response, making this piece of chain mail nothing but a slanted fabrication that unrealistically anthropomorphizes the fetus. This particular type of argument abortion is particularly repugnant to me because it relies on lies and misrepresentation to prey on people who are at a vulnerable time in their lives and turn them away from a solution they may otherwise have considered.",1,1
1175,"If you are referring to the graph of abortion by fetal age, the graph clearly states that its information was taken from the Center for Disease Control and independently corroborated by the Guttmacher Institute. Both sources are plainly cited.  Just because something appears on wikipedia does not automatically mean it is false.",1,1
1176,"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.    Abortion  is  a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'?   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.   It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.  Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.",1,1
1177,"First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion.   If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.",1,1
1178,"Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as ""its my body its my choice"" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.   Selfishless is not illegal, nor should it be.  The fetus  is  making its home inside the mother's body, thus the choice of its continued residence there should not fall to anyone else but her. I am sure you enjoy being able to decide what medical procedures are performed or not performed on your body.   Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.    If abortion is immoral because the fetus is alive, and all things are equally alive, then abortion is the same as uprooting a weed.    There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves.   Foregoing an abortion does not cure the infertility of strangers.   If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.   There is no shortage of existing children who do not have homes. There is no reason to add to the number.  I am going to guess you have never seriously considered what it might be like to be  forced  to be pregnant based on what someone else thinks you are allowed to do with your body.   If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.   No, I wouldn't. If I was a fetus, I would be incapable of anger. If I was conscious, as I am now, I certainly wouldn't be happy, but I would never make another human function as a life support system for me.",1,1
1179,"Am I to gain from this the understanding that you believe abortions are acceptable in the occasional case that the pregnancy is harmful?  If so, if the fact that the fetus is not a child 'makes no difference to the morality of the action', then why allow would you allow abortion in any case, ever? There are no cases in which the murder of a two-year-old is permissible and if a fetus and a two-year-old are interchangeable, what is the difference? If the end result is identical for the fetus, why would motivation make a difference?",1,1
1180,"Who cares what you call it??   Doctors. Scientists. You know, people who understand the developmental cycle of an embryo and realize that the different stages have different capabilities. An egg is not a chicken and a fetus is not a baby.    A baby/fetus/embryo is living inside the mother.   So is her liver, her heart, and her lungs. In quite a similar way, in fact; they are a part of her system and depend on it to live. If removed from her body, they will die.   Abortion terminates that life or the process of becoming a life.   The law should not protect a potential human life at the expense of an established one.   Ya know what else terminates life?   Stepping on a spider?    Murder.   Oh. I guess stepping on a spider is the same as both abortion and murder, since they all terminate life.",1,1
1181,"I do not have God to thank for my mother's decision not to abort me.   If my mother  had  aborted me, I would have no opinion on the matter because I would never have existed.",1,1
1182,"What an ignorant thought. Of course you would have existed. While you obviously wouldn't realize what was happening,   If I had no awareness of my existence before it was terminated, then it is not really a factor to me.    it is still a horrible violation of human rights.    Looks like you got a little mixed up. Not forcing a woman to incubate a fetus she doesn't want is a  preservation  of a human right; the right to bodily autonomy.   Studies have shown again and again that when aborted, the baby is not just a lifeless blob of tissue, it is A LIVING BEING. You jusyt won't accept the evidence. I don't what else must happen to rid you of your foolish thoughts.   Nobody is arguing that a fetus is a lifeless blob of tissue. What they are arguing is that it does not deserve all the rights of a conscious and/or independent human being, especially when granting them such rights would override the rights of an  actual  person - the mother.",1,1
1183,"Because  it's  a beautiful precious child and every time someone terminates one, they are murdering a future president.   A real answer is that people generally like babies and, it seems to me, that they cannot mentally differentiate an infant from an unconscious blastocyst or fetus. Anti-abortion propaganda takes great pains to to fuel this confusion with crap like  this  and  this .",1,1
1184,"If someone got aborted, they wouldn't be around to like it or not. They would have been terminated before they developed a consciousness.   Also, the 'choice' is in pro-choice for a reason. It's fine to for a mother to chose to keep a baby, if she wants to.",1,1
1185,"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.",1,1
1186,"In the interest of making your posts readable, please use complete words and correct spelling. It is only polite.   The reason why I am in such a situation makes no difference to me. I would not want someone to unwillingly function as a life support system for me.   all of your disputes are opinions   As are yours.",1,1
1187,"No one kills a fetus  because  it isn't a conscious being.   A paralyzed person is not in a literal parasitic relationship with another human being. If they are on life support, they are being kept alive by machines. They are not infringing on anyone's rights to bodily autonomy.",1,1
1188,"In the case of paralyzed or comatose patients, if a caretaker becomes unhappy with the situation, they are legally allowed to quit or otherwise cease their involvement. This is also not an issue of bodily autonomy.  The only evidence I need for the parasitism of the fetus is the definition of the word parasite: an organism that lives inside another organism (its host) and siphons resources without reciprocation. The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so. You should be permitted to decide what medical procedures you will undergo or forego. If you do not get to decide this, then your rights to bodily autonomy are being infringed upon. When the interests of the fetus and the mother collide, the mother should take precedence.   This, more than a lack of consciousness in the fetus, is why I support abortion at the discretion of the mother and no one else.",1,1
1189,"I am just going to repeat what I said before in different terms because I am not sure how I can make it any more clear.  A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. This is not the case with an inviable fetus.",1,1
1190,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",1,1
1191,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?    Yes.   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.",1,1
1192,"Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.   I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion.   According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.    I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in  literally  every post since the issue came up. If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.   Abortion is legal.  Murder is not legal.  Therefor, legally, abortion cannot be murder.   And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus.    I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability.    Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.   Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you. An aborted fetus is equally incapable of developing into a human.",1,1
1193,"The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.   To quote you, who cares what is legal and not legal? Laws change all the time. I do not consider it a criminal activity for a woman to choose to have sex in exchange for money; I consider it another example of religious moral being passed into law. However, this is a different debate topic.    I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship.   Okay. I am going to try one more time to explain to you in simple terms why the mother-fetus relationship is parasitic. This is the last time I am going to try to explain it. If you do not understand after this, I will not address the point again; this does not mean I am assuming I am correct by virtue of ending the argument, just that I have thoroughly exhausted all the evidence there is, only to have it ignored by you, and I am not longer going to waste time on it.  When two organisms interact on a biological level, they enter a symbiotic relationship. This relationship can be mutual, commensal, or parasitic. Mutual relationships are relationships in which both organisms involved reap a benefit. Commensal relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits, and the other is not affected at all. Parasitic relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits at the expense of the other organism. (Source:  http://adventuresinscience.edublogs.org/                                     2009/05/20/symbiosis/)  )  Now, pick the relationship that describes the mother-fetus interaction: Mutualism, commensalism, or parasitism.   Additionally, here are several sources that do not add the stipulation of species to the definition or parasite. Note that these are not simply English dictionaries, but biological dictionaries intended to define terms as they can be used in a scientific context.    http://biology-online.org/dictionary/ Parasite     http://en.mimi.hu/biology/parasite.html    http://www.wordiq.com/definition/ Parasite     http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=4769     So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life.    It's the human life part you seem to be having a problem with. Yes, the fetus is alive, and it has human DNA, but I think it is foolish to place its life on the same level as, say, an actual baby. To do so is to say abortion is identical to the murder of a 6 month old baby.    Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   If another organism (human or not) is using a human being as a life support system, the human that is functioning as a life support system has a right to order the end of such a relationship. In your example, the man you are about to shoot is perfectly capable of living without using your body; if you wish to end your involvement with him, you can walk away. A woman who wants to get an abortion does not have this luxury, so the situations are incomparable in that respect. I posed a hypothetical situation in a previous post that I believe you also ignored:  Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of charging them with murder if they do not? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.   The homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America because a fetus is not legally considered a human life. Do you live in country where they do, or do you live in fantasy America?   I also fail to see how my use of the term 'fetus' means that the law suddenly applies to it.    But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.   You do realize that I am not arguing that the fetus is dead, right?   So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.   It is nonsensical to imply that anyone wants to kill a fetus  because  it will develop into a human being. People get abortions because they do not want to be pregnant, and pregnancy should be a voluntary process. If there was a way in which the pregnancy could be terminated and the fetus preserved, that would be ideal. As it is, no such thing exists, the interests of a fully developed and conscious human being should override the interests of a fetus that has no more consciousness than a human lung.   NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.   Even the accidental loss of human life merits an investigation, and it is quite possible to purposefully induce a miscarriage through many avenues. If a fetus is placed on the same level as a human being, then women who miscarried should be immediately subjected to an investigation and arrested for murder if it was determined she is at least partially responsible for the miscarriage, either through intention or negligence.",1,1
1194,"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws.   I hope you remember this very quote in a few minutes, when I point out  again  that abortion is not considered homicide because the law does not recognize a fetus as a human being, therefor does not extend the same protections to it. The fact that you  think  abortion is murder has no influence on whether or not the law considers abortion to be murder.  As I said, the parasitism issue will no longer be addressed because you continue to ignore very basic evidence and qualified unbiased sources, in favor of presenting me with a page from a pro-life website.   You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being.   When the fetus is inside the mother, it is inseparable from her system, and its lack of a fully formed or functioning brain prevents it from developing or retaining an identity.   The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?    That is so far from the only difference between a fetus and a six month old baby.In the fetus, the brain does not even possess all its parts. That is where the organ comparison comes in. It has absolutely nothing to do with their potential; it has to do with capacity for awareness. In this case, the organ and the fetus have equal capacity for awareness: none.  Six month old babies are capable of feeling pain, reacting voluntarily to external stimuli, and their consciousness is not contested in any form. I actually think it is kind of monstrous to suggest abortion is in any way comparable to killing an infant, implying that women who get abortions are exactly the same as people who beat their infants to death.   Note that when I use fetus, I am not referring to all fetuses but to fetuses before the stage of viability, well before the thalamus is formed or functioning. A fetus beyond the point of viability is another matter, I think, as the interests of both the fetus and the mother could be preserved through an early delivery or c-section.   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?   1. I already said I do not agree with this precedent and I think it is contradictory, again, unless the fetus is past the point of viability.  2. People who perform and receive abortions are not charged with homicide. How could this be true if fetuses were protected under homicide legislation?   It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   At no point did I contest any of the things you just mentioned. Why is this the third time you have repeated this? I have never said I think fetuses should be classify as dead. I have said numerous times I know they are alive. The fact that something is biologically classified as living is not what makes it a human life. Where is the disconnect? What do you not understand about this?   I am frustrated with your apparent refusal to understand simple statements, but please understand I am not asking the following question with the intent of being insulting or belittling. We are clearly having a problem understanding each other. Is English your first language?   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.   In order for one to determine whether a miscarriage was induced or spontaneous, they would have to investigate. Therefor, if a fetus was given the same rights as every other human, then every miscarriage would lead to an automatic investigation because every miscarriage could potentially be a murder. If it had been determined that the mother engaged in any activity that led to the miscarriage, even through negligence, she would be treated as though she contributed to the death of a human being, with all the legal punishment this entails.",1,1
1195,"Firstly, unless I missed it, you  still  have not answered my hypothetical question regarding mandatory organ donation to sick people. Why is this?   One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?   You gave me a page from a pro-life page, basically biased by default because they are trying to convince readers that their agenda is the correct one. I gave you four scientific and unbiased sources that defined a parasite-host relationship between two organisms. Not two species. Two organisms. If you cannot see how the fetus fits that definition, which you clearly cannot, then you are beyond being reached by explanation.   So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well?   Perhaps. But, regardless, their life is not dependent on the body of another, therefor there is no need for their death if someone does not want to be involved with them. I am saying this to cut off another rebuttal about euthanizing comatose patients.    Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.   If it is not a brain or a consciousness that gives us our identity, but rather the simple possession of human DNA and the act of being kept alive by a heart, then again, I contend that a fetus and a human liver are equally alive and deserve comparable rights.    Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus?   This is absolute nonsense. I really have no idea what you are trying to say.    Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?   I think I have said before that nobody kills a fetus  because  it is alive, or  because  it has a heart. Please pay attention to the implications of sentence structure. People might kill a fetus because it is dependent on their body and they do not want it to reside in their body anymore, and there is no way to remove it without causing its death.    Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?    I am not in criminal law so I almost hesitate to say this, but it seems as though you were taught false or, at best, misleading information.   http://www.chronline.org/ Feticide%20versus%20Homicide.pdf     But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with?    It's relevance.    Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Okay. I think I understand your train of thought and why you keep harping on the whole not dead = alive thing. If this is incorrect, point out where I went wrong.  Anything that is distinguishable from the dead = alive  Anything that is alive = a life  The act of ending a life = killing  Killing = murder  Murder = homicide  If this is a correct summary of your line of thinking, then you draw no distinctions between different forms of life, their capabilities, and the rights they are afforded, and additionally, you draw no distinction between murder and any other method of ending any form of life. It would mean that shooting someone in pure self defense = homicide. Accidentally striking a pedestrian who was not in a cross walk = homicide. Slaughtering a chicken for food = homicide. Plucking a flower = homicide. Using antibacterial soap = homicide.   If this is incorrect, then I actually do not have any idea why you keep bringing this point up, because clearly you  are  capable of   a) distinguishing between different forms of life   b) realizing that life with higher functions are granted more rights under the law, and  c) understanding that the law does not protect any form of life from being ended by any means.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.   People estimate that as few as 15% and as high as 78% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, many times before the woman even knew she was pregnant. Even on the low end of the estimate, that is a lot of women to subject to a homicide investigation directly after they experience miscarriage. Then, if it has been convincingly shown the abortion was not 'spontaneous' (how? I have no idea), then comes the problem of deciding how responsible a woman is. What if she smokes or drinks, possibly causing a fatally premature birth? What if she fell down a flight of stairs, how will she prove she didn't do it on purpose? What if she stays in a relationship with an abusive man who eventually beat her so bad she miscarried; is this not causing death through inaction? What if she didn't obey her doctor's order of strict bed rest? What if she went on a roller coaster ride or ate some sushi? What if she just stressed herself out too much? How much jail time do the women in each of these situations deserve?",1,1
1196,"It's definitely dishonest to present this as a picture of abortion in general, and sadly it preys on people who have no better source of information. Most women will not have abortions using this procedure, and their fetuses will not look at all like that. They probably will not even be recognizably human. If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done. If you are pro-choice, you may have to accept the fact that they are just tough for laypeople to look at, even suction aspiration. It's not at all a point in favor of pro-life; childbirth and open-heart surgery can turn stomachs, too.",1,1
1197,"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion.   Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legal…on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.   But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission.   Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.    It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.   Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things! If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.",1,1
1198,"If they are not prepared for the consequences, then yes.    You seem to be using 'prepared for the consequences' in a way that implies the only way to be prepared for an unwanted pregnancy is to allow it to go to term. Abortion is a way of dealing with the consequence of pregnancy, and is in itself a consequence that someone might be prepared for.",1,1
1199,"Abortion is a disgusting thing. That's a fact.   No, it isn't. That is an opinion.    I see nothing wrong with working to reduce public acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control.   A little public shaming never hurt anyone, right?  I know we've been over this before and the conversation got to be too much for me to keep straight as much as it was interesting, so I'll try to keep this focused. You speak as if your definition of the 'unnecessary' is the one that matters. I'm sure you understand that many people actually getting abortions consider it absolutely necessary...and without understanding their circumstances, you're advocating public hostility towards their choice. What qualifies you to decide what is necessary and unnecessary for strangers, and what social punishment they should receive if they don't obey your standards?",1,1
1200,"If you mean disgusting as in 'gross to watch,' then we're in agreement, but that doesn't turn an opinion into a fact.    How dare I speak as if what I think matters!?   More than the thoughts of people actually faced with getting abortions?   If it's necessary it's not really a choice, is it?   If by necessary, you mean something that logically follows and literally cannot be other way, then even your 'necessary' abortions are not necessary. No medical procedures are 'necessary.' After all, people can always 'choose' to let themselves die slow, painful deaths.   I can't decide what's necessary.   You already have. Unless you did actually mean necessary in the logical sense, you've decided 'necessary' means 'necessary to prevent the mother from suffering death or serious injury.' An abortion could be necessary to restore the mother's health a pre-pregnancy level, necessary to maintain a lifestyle that enables a mother to support her existing children, necessary to preserve the mother's mental health, necessary to allow the mother control of her own reproductive life, or necessary for any number of things you've decided are less important than not getting an abortion.    I'd like ""doctors"" who perform surgeries that don't play a role in maintaining or restoring health to be recategorized as hacks.   Things that would make doctors hacks according to you:  Correcting birth defects such as extra fingers, tails, or deviated septa  Cosmetic reconstructive surgery for accident victims  All exploratory surgeries  ---  Things that wouldn't:  Abortion (unless you can show me that pregnancy does not reduce the mother's health from its pre-pregnancy level, thus making abortion a procedure that restores health)",1,1
1201,"It's just a tad more deep seated than an opinion...   I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics and it's not actually a sentiment I disagree with, but that something is disgusting  to you  only a fact if you specify that. Disgust is subjective no matter how widely it is shared.   Perhaps in the mind of someone considering one when there are better options.   What makes an option better than abortion? Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives...   First, I am willing to operate on whatever definition of necessary you are using. You used it once in one way, and once in another way. If we've established you're not using logical necessity, that's fine.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options. What are you using to support this claim? Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Sorry, I left out ""improving"". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.   If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact, but I think this still excludes abortion. Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman.   As it is a difficult experience, I don't doubt makes some women stronger. It could also break her or ruin her life if she can't deal with it, or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires. There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.  I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not. You and I are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands, but we haven't because we're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves. Is that unacceptable?    If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.  The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/safety_of_abortion.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                        facts/post_abortion_issues.html",1,1
1202,"Go back to my previous post and find the part where I said something to the effect of the following: ""No woman has ever experienced any negative emotions after getting an abortion.""  If you can do that, your response won't have been mostly a waste of time.    How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals.   You wouldn't have to ask this if you read the source I provided. How did researchers reach the conclusion that most women feel relieved after an abortion? They asked them. They administered surveys to women who underwent abortions and asked them to explain how they felt about the process. 76% said they felt relieved. The data doesn't agree with your stance, learn to deal with it.    http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/ Phil%207570%20Website/aAdler1990.pdf     I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.   You know people who have regretted abortions, so it's impossible that most abortion patients are okay with their procedure? This is blatantly biased. Your subject group is heavily skewed: women who are happy with their abortions obviously won't come looking for abortion healing so they're not nearly as visible to you. It's fallacious to assume your experience is representative of everyone's.   For the women who do feel guilt or depression: how much of that is owed to the prevalence of the idea that they  should  feel terrible for getting abortions? If family and/or society is unsupportive or hostile to women who choose abortion, or if they're even perceived that way, doesn't it make sense for at least some of them to be negatively impacted by that?  I really hope you don't bring your accusatory and condemning attitude to your interactions with women who are struggling with their abortions.",1,1

However, I realize you place more value on faith than logic, and I do not think that logic is inherently better than faith so I would never try to force you to accept logic over faith. I think you should afford people the same courtesy, realize God and the Bible are not important to everyone, and not try to extend your judgments and morals to include them.",1,1
1209,"I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   If you only 'blame' the man when he rapes the woman, shouldn't you conversely only blame the woman if she rapes the man? In consensual sex, both partners are equally involved in the decision to give the sperm and the egg the opportunity to meet. You say ""she allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg"" like it came knocking on the door of her egg and she decided to let it in.  What do you feel is gained from assigning blame to anybody?   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.     ac·ci·den·tal   1. happening by chance or accident; not planned; unexpected: an accidental meeting.  2. nonessential; incidental; subsidiary: accidental benefits.  3. a nonessential or subsidiary circumstance, characteristic, or feature.  I would think a review of the definition would be enough to show that yes, accidental pregnancies exist, whether or not you believe in them. When you engage in an activity, you are not automatically consenting to allow the potential negative consequences of that activity to run their course without interference.   For example, every time you get in a car, you realize there is a possibility you will get in a car accident. This does not mean you are consenting to being injured without trying to reverse or mitigate your injuries. You are engaging in activity, recognizing the risks and doing your best to prevent them while still intending to undo any damage that may occur. Removing any sentimentality from the issue of abortion, it is no different. Pregnancy is an occasional consequence of sex and abortion is a way of dealing with that consequence.",1,2

Even if that person is your own offspring, even if that person is a completely self-aware adult, your body should not be used for anything against your ongoing permission.

1211,"I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   With conjoined twins, the ownership of the body can be disputed. They share bones and organs; it is not a clear-cut case of one separate but dependent organism residing in another. I know there is physiological variation with conjoined twins, but take Abigail and Brittany Hensel as an example:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel    How can one sister make a claim to the shared organs at the expense of the other sister? They own them equally. I don't believe a fetus can be said to own any part of the mother's body  at all , much as less as much as the mother does.  Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved.

1222,"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument?   You're so wrapped up in this duality you've created you haven't even considered that my position is not one of morality. I'm not ""for"" or ""against"" abortion.   It's called ""pro CHOICE"" not ""pro abortion"". =/   You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right.   No, you've IMPOSED this position on me. This is a matter of your prejudice, not my implication.   Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact?   I don't care because it doesn't matter. I have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people. Perhaps some people end up more responsible, perhaps some don't.   The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.   To justify and prove, eh? A debate is a means, the purpose is invented by the individual. This is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own.   Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone.   You seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion. A position without opinion is just facts, a position without facts is just opinion. You need both.  I'm not arguing against the facts, I'm arguing against your stupidity. Don't try to shift the blame onto the facts, they can't help what they are.   Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case.   Because your argument is rooting in morality, mine is rooting in questioning your morality. If you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference, you're still arguing from your personal preferences.   And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself.   Then start a debate ""How did Abortion Originate?"". It's another topic and doesn't bare any relevance to this one.    Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you?   You wouldn't like my answer =p   Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.   Can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar? You can pull up ""facts"" until your fingers are worn to stubs. It means nothing if they aren't relevant.    If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?   You... totally missed the point -_-   Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion.   Are you dyslexic? That made almost no sense. =/  Again, look up the term ""debunking"".   But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them?   Again, I've said no such thing. At least  try  to make relevant arguments. =/   I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.   Well well, what a noble man you are; placing the value of life above the value of a good life...  Did I say noble? I meant retarded.   Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?   Again, either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots. ;)   Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.   Debating 101: debunking and calling out opponents on non-sequiters IS how a debate works.   There's no need to ""prove"" someone else's abortion is none of my (or your) business. Debunking your reasons for being ""pro-life"" does that by itself. Do you understand?   You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.   1+2=3 &lt;&lt; you understand this, right? Well, here's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend.   District attorneys are people. People can be stupid and childish; therefore, district attorneys can be stupid and childish.  There's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they aren't infallible.    Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.   Everything is constantly changing. You're heart pumps fresh blood, your skin falls off and is replaced, sperms turn into zygotes etc. etc. etc.  Life and death aren't opposites, they're complementariness.   Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.   Wrong again. I'm not building an argument, I'm debunking yours. There's no ""running"" here, simply wading through the things you've said.   And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?   Nothing you just wrote changes that your Hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate. you could be lying about the whole thing for all I know.  Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do I have to explain everything to you? ;)",1,1
1223,"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you.   Just asked my brother. Nope, one can be neither for nor against abortion. It's called CHOICE. It's not a matter of ""abortion is good/bad!"" abortion is just an act. ""Good"" and ""bad"" are labels imposed by you.   Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion.   I'm 90% sure you're a troll now. Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Say it with my now; Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Pro choice is about individuals choosing to either get an abortion or not based on their own unique situation.    Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge.   Man, you're really judgmental, aren't you. ;)  I don't particularly care if you find me selfish and ignorant, you have yet to give a relevant reason as to why abortion should be illegal. Not once in all your barely comprehend able posts have you done this.   Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence.   Actually, this is YOUR debate, or did you mean argument? ;)  There is no inconsistent information in my argument because I haven't posted any ""information"", I've only been debunking you, so now you're a liar. And a bad one at that, do you think I don't comprehend my own posts or something? XD   Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science.   I never even said anything remotely like that... -_-    You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts.   No, opinions should be built on RELEVANT facts. For example; I say you have made the logical fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"" this is a fact. You say ""Woma have died from abortions, therefore abortion should be wrong"" This is also a fact, it just isn't a relevant one. And if your argument is based on fallacies and irrelevant facts &gt;&gt;YOU ARE WRONG&lt;&lt;   Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy.   ... Do you think I care? Really? Let them read it. I'll debate them too if they carry your idiocy with them.   I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.   And are they all ""pro-life"" too? If so, I've nothing to worry about. ;)   You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance.    You're projecting again ;)   You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey.   Oh, I've thought about what you're trying to convey; I've just decided it's wrong relative to the topic is all, ;)   When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.   Again, I'm not against facts. I'm against your stupidity. I'm against the conclusions you've derived from these facts. Stop trying to pass the blame onto the facts, they can't change, but you sure as hell can.   And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.   ... And yet you have. Is your dunce cap on too tight or something?   There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute.   Man, it takes a lot of repetition for you to learn, doesn't it? I never said you can't use these things, hell you may even win a debate with them if you're talking to someone even dumber than you (insert your own ""country full of idiots for you to talk to"" joke)... but when you're talking to someone intelligent enough to recognize a logical fallacy (e.g. Myself... and everyone else on this site) you're bound to get called out on it.  And, if you're entire argument is based on a fallacy, then you're wrong. Thus, you lose.   And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.   Selfishness? THIS IS SSSSSSSSSayyad99's attempt at hurting my feelings? I have a hard time taking offense to insults written by someone with a third grade writing level. =/",1,1
1224,"When you say that term neither you are portraying to me that either you are confused or you are not sure which side to take.   I am pro-choice. I've been pro-choice since the beginning of this debate and I've made that clear several times. If you haven't realized this by now then it is you who is confused, not I.   How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion?   Exactly what did I write that gave you the idea I'm ""pro-abortion""? Do you think I want to make abortions mandatory or something? I'm not pro abortion or anti abortion, there are cases where abortion is a good choice, and cases where it is a bad choice; but regardless of the case, it's not our choice. It's hers.   If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose?   If there were two teams, one was pro-rape and the other was pro-arson, which one would you choose? -_-   Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose?   Neither.   Huh... I guess I could say neither, couldn't I. ;)  It's almost as though I have... a choice. o.O   When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please.   When did I say pro-choice was NOT referring to a woman's right to have an abortion? What are you even talking about?   You words tells a lot about you and to be very honest with you that is why my response is coming so low graded to you because expect to get what you portray.   You're lying again. You've been acting like an idiot since the beginning AND you've been acting like an idiot towards others. Or are they all ""low graded"" as well? But even if what you say is true, you'd still be an idiot because that is the only kind of person that would purposefully debate poorly to ""match"" his opponents wit.   Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less.   What means less? You haven't connected this sentence to anything so I have no idea what you're talking about.   You seem to forget that you are debunking without facts so if i am liar good for me.   I'm not using facts... so it's good that you're a liar? You make less and less sense every post.   You seem to think facts are some holy grail and whomever has the most of them ""wins"" or something. Let me tell you, in matters of philosophy logic trumps facts. you can string together miles of facts, if the logic doesn't follow then you're wrong.   Again i will not have you calling me names and if you do not stop then i will restrain you from posting any arguments in relation to my debates because name calling is childishness to me and the same goes for comparing.   I repress nothing about myself. If I feel like calling you an idiot then I will and if you aren't mature enough to handle such criticism then perhaps your better off banning me.  It would only show your insecurities.   I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent.   Once again, you're projecting. If ""judging"" is a ban-able offense in your books then you should of banned yourself a hundred times over.   Let us keep it to a professional level please.   I agree, lets keep it professional. I'll stop calling you names and you stop:  Straw-man-ing  Lying  Red-herring....ing  Appealing to authority  Appealing to emotion  And going off topic  I think this sound more than fair.   My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts?   Yeas, I have you an example where I used a fact. What, you want me to re-type EVERYTHING I've written out thus far and highlight everything that qualifies as a fact???  Look, I've debunked you're conclusions. Now you either concede or go about un-debunking me. THAT'S how a debate works. It's not about who has the most facts, it's about who's position makes the most sense.   Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion.   Inconsistent with what? Do you even know what the word inconsistent means? (rhetorical)  Everything you've said so far has been one of the things I asked you to stop doing earlier in this post. They are all fallacies, so yes, your entire argument is based on fallacy. You've even admitted that your arguments are based on appeals to emotion/authority, so I'm not sure exactly what you're complaining about here...   And again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges.   Really? Just 2 (two!) paragraphs ago you threatened to ban me based on what I call you. You, once again, are lying.   You can say all you want but it wouldn't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level.   You know my proposal. The balls in your court.",1,1

Perhaps you would keep the unborn child because you want to give birth to it and love it later in life, but then this is just a matter of YOUR personal preference and should ONLY be considered in the matter of your own child.

1241,"You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.   Is it really? How fascinating    For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.   Yes personal responsibility is a terrible thing...something we should never expect of anyone...   I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   How subjectively arbitrary, you think your opinion here gives weight to your argument? Interesting.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.   Semantics, depends which nation you live in.  OK Abortion is killing, pure and simple...  Have I seen a foetus?  What a seemingly stupid question...what relevance is that?  Please elucidate.",1,2

What law, of which nation?  Besides laws can be changed.   Being against killing isn't much of an argument. We kill every day. As far as I and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned, killing a foetus is little different from killing an Apple when you made cider.   Utterly ridiculous.

Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.  Fruit were evolved to be eaten.  I shall cite a reference for you...  ''In biology (botany), a ""fruit"" is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries. Taken strictly, this definition excludes many structures that are ""fruits"" in the common sense of the term, such as those produced by non-flowering plants (like juniper berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers[1]), and fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues close to the fruit (accessory fruit, or more rarely false fruit or pseudocarp), such as cashew fruits. Often the botanical fruit is only part of the common fruit, or is merely adjacent to it. On the other hand, the botanical sense includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, tomatoes, and many more. However, there are several variants of the biological definition of fruit that emphasize different aspects of the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits.[2]''  Wiki - Fruit  You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.",1,2
1246,"You keep throwing around that word ""unique"" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.   I think you have missed my basic point.  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana...so your comparisons are utterly absurd.",1,2
1247,Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds).

1252,"Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.  Fruits are not multicellular organisms, in the traditional scientific sense...they are a part of an organism...my testes are composed of living cells that respire and excrete but i do not consider them independant animals of their own right...  This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...  Now do you realise how illogical your absurd argument is?",1,2

A foetus is human...a Plum is not.  That is the crux...which you do not grokk...",1,2
1254,"In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.   In order to be 'sacred' or human you need to have human DNA.  In order to be a unique organism/lifeform (multicellular or unicellular) you need unique DNA or perhaps even RNA in the case of viruses.

These facts alone should convince anyone to eliminate the idea of pregnancy termination out of their mind.   The health threat to the mother after going through with the procedure as well as the lifelong health risks that remain should be good enough reasons abortion should be illegal.

I am trying to have an open mind, so my question for the pro-choice group is, should there be any restrictions on abortion at all?

Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods.

The only protection that could be offered to the fetus was in a manner that servered the state's intrest while protection the privacy of the woman.

Sometimes I feel as though it should be illegal because if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child.

First off, I don't think anyone ever thought that because you had sex, you were also responsible. But, either way, the option for abortion should be legal, I think that making abortion 100% illegal would be a terrible decision. There will always be fringe cases in which abortion makes more sense than having a child, and to strike that option off the list forever would just create unsafe, unmanaged, abortion clinics because they would have to go underground and operate in secrecy without proper health standards. All in all, this country would be much worse off without it.",1,2
1369,It should be legal because it is an action on someone's body and that person has a right to do what they want with their body.

If the person considering abortion lives in poverty(or other adverse conditions) and does not feel or know that she can properly care for the baby once it is born and give it the foundation of a good and healthy life then an abortion should be legal so as that the suffering that the child would endure could be prevented.

Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",1,1
1414,"Safe, legal, and rare. Prevent rape by sex-ed, use only highly-trained doctors, and include it in insurance. If an abortion is necessary (mental, physical, or deciding not to have a kid), then do it. Abortion pretty much only works after 3 weeks, and before that, contraception.",1,1
1415,"Yes, of course. It's ridiculous to tell a woman that it is not her choice to keep or get rid of her unborn child. She will be the one to carry it and ultimately decide to keep it or not. And, to arguments that say the child could, 'grow up to be someone special', yes, and he/she could grow up to be someone who contributes nothing to society at all. Anyway, I'd rather have one less abused or neglected child, don't we have enough kids with horrible lives? Why would you want to put someone in that position? Also, you can't force the woman bear the child! What happened to all our rights?",1,1
1416,"I hate all the JESUS FREAKS, no offense, who keep saying ""life begins at conception!"" or ""Abortion is legalized murder!"" screw you! I am personally against Abortion but i am pro choice.

1417,"Making abortion illegal does not prevent abortions. Those who can afford to circumvent the system will (by going to another state/country/bribing a doctor/etc)--in reality, outlawing abortion hurts poor women more than any other demographic because they are the ones that will turn to back-alley abortions and suffer infection/complications/death because of it.  Also, the government has a greater obligation to the health of the mother than the fetus. We can argue all we want about when life begins, but I'm pretty sure you're not a citizen until after you're born. At least, until they start issuing conception certificates instead of birth certificates.",1,1
1418,"i believe that it is wrong but that i also think that it should be legal because some people don't have any control over getting pregnant because of rape. and they just are not ready to have a child because or age, finances or both. it also needs to be legal because women and or men will take it into their own hands and do it themselves therefore inflicting damage upon themselves as well possibly permanent damage. and maybe even death to the mother. abortions have to be legal or all hell will break loose and the death rate will increase substantially",1,1
1419,"If it isn't a human, what is it?  If it isn't alive, how can you kill it?  But if it is a human, than it has rights.  If it is alive, than killing it is murder.  Last I checked, murder is illegal (unless you happen to be an unborn baby, in which case you just don't count).",1,1
1420,frist of you can only have an abortion if the fetus is at least 28 days old in the stomic of course but its not takeing any human life it would braly have been growing outof the egg so yes it ahould be legal but only for 17 and below people,1,1
1421,"It is allowed to kill to save your own life.. it should therefore be okay to kill a fetus if this saves the life of it's mother..   But I dont think it should be allowed to kill unwanted fetuses, those can be given to adoption..  its hard to tell if it's the child of a rapist though, I don't think I would want to give birth to the child of my tormentor if I were a woman..",1,1
1422,Abortion should be legal for it is ultimately the Mother's choice.

1425,"I don't think that is an age where you necessarily fully understand consequences, vies change when people get older. It's that time when everyone wants to have fun.  As for adoption, the baby is going to have to be born but it's even more painful never knowing who their true parents are and always questioning it.   Abortion seems a way to fully erase one's mind of the error they had made.",1,2
1426,"I disagree with you at the age of 16 and 18 they do fully understand consequences. Parents and teachers and life teach them that every action has consequences and by that age there have been enough lessons of actions and consequences.   If you think having an abortion fully erases the mind of ""error"" as you call it then well then you never had one. It sure does not erase your mind.",1,1
1427,"Some people will never be able to comprehend fully, the consequences of their actions, ageless. Yes we have been taught that consequences have actions, but not everyone has learnt.

Most abortions that take place in America are cases of convenience, which is clearly wrong! I do understand that cases of rape or medical necessity are more difficult and cannot be black and white. I have compassion for these mothers and feel for their situations. Adoption is a great alternative!",1,2
1430,"In Susan Wicklund's book ""this common secret"" about her struggles as an abortion provider, she tells a story of a woman who goes in for an abortion because she believes her abusive husband will kill the baby if she has it. She is turned down, and shortly after the baby is born, she appears at the E.R. with the dead baby. Which is better, Renee, the chance of a baby ACTUALLY being killed, or never being born?  Abortion is NOT child abuse. murder and real abuse is.  people are more likely to abuse a child they don't want right?  Why not give them the chance to not abuse a child at all?",1,2
1431,"Abortion should not be legal. It causes massive deaths, and every human life has unailinable rights endowed by their CREATOR among these are LIFE, (FIRST) and liberty (SECOND) ... Abortion is always a sad and bad choice. I recently got off a flight from Beiging, China, where I met a VERY happy couple who waited 3 years to adopt the 8mos. old beautiful baby girl that they were finally bringing home with them. What a special occasion! Too bad it is so difficult to adopt here, because there are so few babies available, or they would have. The point is; life matters, and adoption is a positive, and very possible answer where BOTH the mother and baby can have bright futures. There are crisis pregnency centers in most towns with helpful people who care deeply about the mother, and baby. Wouldn't YOU prefer adoption over death for YOURSELF ? What CHOICE do you think the unbornbabies would make?? Who will give the baby, it's choice and chance ?.......Can we unite now? What kind of a society sentences these innocent unborn babies to DEATH, ...and gives LIFE sentences to guilty massmurderers ??? Thankfully, Virginia just voted to stop funding abortions with your taxes through Planned Parenthood ( see Wash. Post 2/28/08). Did you know that Planned Parenthood which sounds so good, is the number one provider of death by abortions ? It is also in approx. 180 other countries offering abortions with America's ( your tax ) money. Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes. That is what the government now does if not stopped. Lets not support Planned Parenthood, who is pro-abortion/death. Let's support the heroes at crisis pregnancy centers who can then better assist mothers in crisis before and after the babies birth...and lets vote pro-LIFE together from now on...

1432,"An example of a post by someone who does not understand science.  THE FOETUS (UK SPELLING) IS NOT ALIVE, it cannot be asked on its rights and has no nervous system, there is a greater need in the social aspects and it is inane to suggest that there is murder in something which saves the money, time, and essentially life of the mother.  The mother keeps the rights, not the child.",1,1
1433,"A fetus does not have an informed conscious(at least there is no scientific proof) and thus it could not make a choice of death over adoption or life and thus it means nothing to ask ""What choice do you think the unborn babies would make"" as this is an appeal to emotion.  Also to complain that governments force people against their religion to pay with their taxes for abortion seems hypocritical and naive. If you don't want government to use your tax dollars for abortions because it is against your religion why should the government support tax breaks for religion and your church? because not everyone follows a particular religion yet they end up paying for it. Also don't forget that some churches of various religions work very hard to impose their doctrine/beliefs on to others of which they have no right.

I am going to assume that both of those answers is yes, thus it matters little whether a fetus is conscious, merely that if allowed to grow and develop it will have a conscious mind, but if an abortion is carried out that life will never be given a chance to develop. Just imagine what this world would be like if Jonas Salk, or Sir Isaac Newton, or Albert Einstein, or Abraham Lincoln, or George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson had been aborted as children. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like.",1,2

Many people die before they have a chance to become somebody like Albert Einstein yet the evidence of their path is there to see, but the government and others don't worry about trying to preserve their life, just the life of a chance which could go any number of ways.",1,1

1443,"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.",1,1

When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.",1,1

1446,"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.  First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.  But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.",1,1

1449,"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?  Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?  You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.  If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.  Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.  Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.  It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.  Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?  I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.  Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.",1,2
1450,"I am surprised you say that you don't care about what the laws say. Try telling that to a trial judge. Anyway, it is good that you made that point because a fetus is at a point where the brain is now developing making them unaware of the surrounding which is why people refers to them as being in the baby stage. But you are failing to understand that because of the destruction of those cells, the life of the person might be in danger which is why a criminal charge has to be instituted. The type of cells and tissues however that we are referring to is referred to as a developing human being who is growing into complete human form with a complete DNA and blood type. But didn't you say that what a woman does with her body is nobody's business then how come there are laws to prevent her from prostituting her body?  Okay. According to statistics released by the WHO in terms of abortion, the number of abortions that performed for the year 1995- 45.5 million of which 19.9 million were illegal.  According to a report from The Guttmacher Institute, Unsafe abortion causes an estimated 70,000 deaths each year, and an additional five million women are treated annually for complications resulting from unsafe abortion. Approximately three million women who experience serious complications from unsafe procedures go untreated.  The following methods describe the different methods of abortion. Since you are also a person of science read up on horrifying methods of abortion in which we do not even do this with animals;  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068  I agree but the only purpose abortion serves is to kill the fetus, a human life or organism. Condom does something better than what abortion does. Condom prevents the spread of diseases. And i also agree but how can it be explicit language when i have proof to back up my opinion released by the U.S Gov? Are we aborting a fetus because of fear of infection?  That i will agree with you. I am but a teenager not a child. There is a difference between a teenager and a child. A child is an individual who has not meet the stage of puberty. A teenager is an individual who has or is already going through the stage of puberty. And i also agree with you that there many things i can learn from adults, as long as i am learning it from the correct source. Well we are not discussing a debate based on politics; we are discussing abortion and the law. And i also agree with you that i do have a lot to learn. Oh and by the way now you are starting to use your critical thinking skills. I love that. Now i feel tha twe can openly discuss any topic.",1,2
1451,"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument? You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right. Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact? The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.  Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone. Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case. And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself. Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you? Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.  If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?  Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion. Really? But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them? I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.  Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?  Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.  You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.  Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.  Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.  And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?",1,2
1452,"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you. Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion. If i recalled my opposing team was pro choice. Why? Because they are against abortion. You seem to be lacking common sense. Really? As far as i am concerned whatever a person say portrays the idea of that person as in reading a book and trying to figure out the idea or goal of the writer. Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge. Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence. Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science. You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts. Please, you are a person of science one day you will stand against an opposing team face to face and then you will understand what i am talking about. When you say that i am retarded lets say that a woman who intentionally has unprotected sex aware of the consequences but now goes to the extent of killing the fetus, are you implying that there is no innocence or good in that fetus? Are you saying that there is nothing wrong with that? To me that is just selfishness. Well in order to debate a topic you need to know the origin of that case and then identify the weakness in that origin. If it was a speech called informative speech and lets say you were referring to reasons why abortion should be made illegal then the origin would have been completely different as my professor advised me last week. Well Actually you do not need to say who is worst or not because i have friends in pre law on here and have already taken a look at this debates and has already given me a response.  Why are you running from the truth? Point out to one statement which you made that had an authoritative reference? Exactly. When you think you know everything or do not want to know then your perception might be wrong. Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy. Believe me and my team comprises of at least 25 members who are excellent at debating. I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.  You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance. You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey. Maybe you are better off in science. When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.  And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.  There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute. Check up on your book again my friend. And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.",1,2
1453,"When you say that term neither you are portraying to me that either you are confused or you are not sure which side to take. How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion? If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose? Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose? When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please. You words tells a lot about you and to be very honest with you that is why my response is coming so low graded to you because expect to get what you portray. Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less. You seem to forget that you are debunking without facts so if i am liar good for me. Again i will not have you calling me names and if you do not stop then i will restrain you from posting any arguments in relation to my debates because name calling is childishness to me and the same goes for comparing. Really? I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent. Let us keep it to a professional level please. By doing this you are making both of us look like two children which we are not. My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts? Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion. And again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges. You can say all you want but it wouldn't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level.",1,2
1454,"I will ban you because you are over stepping your limits not because i care because you don't go around judging people and calling them names like you do. If you keep out of that then perhaps our debate will be good. I create the rules when i create my debates and if you question whether it is my debate or not then you are pushing me to show you whose court the ball is in.  In an argument the term pro choice refers to the killing of the fetus. Change it all you want but you will never be able to change the true meaning of the word. Pro Choice is another way of saying pro abortion. The question here is to kill or not to kill the fetus so i do not know what is the goal of your question? I want an answer not a meaningless question. Rape and Arson is in no way to compare to this topic because they do not even involve the taking of a human life and also both are morally wrong as in abortion where one side is considered morally wrong.  Are you in your right state of mind, then do me a favor and stop debating about abortion if you are not referring to it. Pro choice refers to the term supporting abortion.  I am not going to go further debating you. You are an immature idiot filled with nonsense. There is no point in even debating you. Maybe you should go back to junior high school and grow up. You have proved to me what stupidity is like so goodbye! And by the way it is not the length of the argument but the quality of the argument.",1,2
1455,My third grade writing skills are meant for people who can't understand fourth grade writing and reading skills.,1,2
1456,I already did that is why i could. You made improvements in your last few arguments but other than that take a look at the rebuttals where you kept saying do not care. Do you know how childish that sounded?,1,2
1457,"Look at what you said that started this and tell me if this was appropriate to begin an argument.  Just...grow up.  Perhaps you are against abortion and it isn't a good thing for you, but it's just childish to demand that everyone conforms to your silly preferences.",1,2
1458,Like i said i would i banned you. Learn to act professional next time and then we will get along. Don't act like a child. I have no time for your worthless arguments. You are no way as compared to a challenge for me and you yourself told me i can be a great debater so you yourself proved your statements to be a liar.,1,2
1459,"Oh and one more thing since you are on a debating website then maybe you should read up on the rules of debating especially about the part that said if you don't have facts to support your claims then what it the purpose of that debate. And as i said to my opposing team in the last face to face debate which lasted for 5 hours in two weeks and was based on abortion, ""DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK BECAUSE WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE FACTS PORTRAY.""",1,2
1460,Use your head for once and try to figure out the whole purpose of my argument.Who says you can't you use appeal to emtion or authority in debating? I would like to say who said that? And who says you also can't use different topics if they are similar in the point you are trying to make?,1,2
1461,"Maybe you should check the statistics to show how many women are having repeat abortions. Do you think that the unborn should pay for the mistakes of it's mother? Most women according to statistics are having repeat abortions. I was born out of child pregnancy. My mother regardless of being challenged with poverty and unpreparedness brought me up. Today i am a student in pre law with a G.P.A of 4.0 and straight A student. Do you think that bringing me up made her a responsible woman or abortion?  Furthermore, for every mistake there is a punishment. Didn't parents punished you for a mistake, don't the laws punish you for a mistake, don't your job punish you for a mistake?Why? Before consensual unprotected sex, every woman have a choice to protect themselves and is fully aware of the consequences of their actions. So why should they claim they are unprepared after learning they are pregnant?",1,2
1462,"I was waiting for someone to bring up this point.  While some women may still have abortions, the abortion rate will definitely decrease by; it is my guess about 90% or even more. How many people would commit murder if it was legal, do you think? Obviously making something illegal is always a deterrent for a large amount of people.  That people will do it anyway is no argument to legalize something heinous. By the same token, should we legalize rape now so that no rapist will have to do it in secret, or because he would do it otherwise anyway?  Why should we abort a child because of mental retardation etc? In the same way should we kill a person because they are mentally ill?  When you talk about horrible process; what is more horrible being half awake whilst doctors are ripping your fetus out of you are giving birth to a life? What if a woman dies from abortion? You are talking as if carrying a pregnancy is more traumatic than doing an abortion. We are against abortion because we are talking about a life and as one professional once said it seems that those who supports abortion are the ones that are already born.  If a person is raped then give the baby up for adoption. There are other choices available. Don't make it seem as if abortion is the only way out.",1,2
1463,Really? So how come when a person commits suicide the state has every right to stop that person from doing it? Why don't you answer that then?  Why do you keep saying her body. The fetus is inside her body but not her body. The fetus has a completely different DNA and blood type than the mother and if the blood type of the fetus comes in contact with the blood type of the mother it can be fatal.,1,2
1464,Wrong. It is because of the people living in this land who saw it as being wrong gave government that right and they also gave government the right to make abortion illegal until the Supreme Court decided that the state had no right to intervene and made their decision based on a lie. I do not think the Court had the authority to make that decsion becasue it was the majority of people who conferred that right upon the state and not the Court.  How can you compare a fetus DNA with a parasite DNA? Are parasites or bacterias from the human race? I never know that the human race can also be a parasite? Can it? The DNA of a fetus is fromed from the Chromosomes of the mother and father which posess a different but unique DNA. Oh and by the way does parasites and bacterias has a unique but different blood type also?,1,2
1465,I was referring to when as person is at risk of committing suicide. Sorry for the mistake.,1,2
1466,Well the fetus feeds through it's mother. An egg is not a developing human being neither does it possess life. The fetus cannot be hugged i agree but why then when you go to a doctor they normally detect the heartbeat of the unborn to check whether it is alive or not. Does the heartbeat not indicates the presence of life? Does the fetus not have a separate DNA and blood type? Does the fetus not have a growing human body?,1,2
1467,So my answer to you is should we pay rapists not to commit rapes and cause unwanted pregnancies too? What about their rights? If you are saying that because we believe abortion is wrong then we are taking the rights of Americans then what about the rights of the child as a developing human too? Isn't that an American too?,1,2
1468,"Really? Then why don't you try telling that to the laws that prevents a woman from prostitutions, suicide or use of drugs. Doesn't these laws prevent a woman from controlling her body?  Arent the laws taking away the rights of a woman here? And further more why don't you check up on the statistics of woman with repeat abortions, yearly death of the mothers from abortion, effects of abortion on a mother and also the horrific methods of abortion",1,2
1469,"So my question to you also is a man who holds a gun to shoot another man also has legal rights but wouldnt the cops kill the one holding the gun to save the life of the other one, even though both have legal rights of personhood?",1,2
1470,"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",1,2
1471,"So are you saying that murder is not cruelty? According to the laws it is and also a person can commit rape in a cruel manner by hurting the victim mentally and physically through the ordeal.  Like i asked aveske, a person who is paralyzed has lost their consciousness, so should we kill them because they cannot think or feel too?",1,2
1472,I agree with you. We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.,1,2
1473,Do you have any evidence to suggest that the fetus is more of a parasitic entity? It is not a conscious being but so are the people who are paralyzed who depend on other people to take care of them even though they are on life support machines. According to you a fetus is not a conscious being so how can it infringe on a person's right to her own body?,1,2
1474,You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?,1,2
1475,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus? You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well. If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence. And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.",1,2
1476,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life. Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?",1,2
1477,"Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.  According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised. And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus. How is this psssible if the fetus is a parasite? And how does the human body not fight against the fetus but rather undergo changes to accept the fetus?  Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?  Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.",1,2
1478,"The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.  I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship. Scientifically, in order for the realtionship to be considered parasitic, therehas to be the elements of parasitism to exists. Those elements are not here. Let me put it this way for you, every adult person has personhood but if the elements of personhood are absent, it means that person does not have personhood at all even though some might consider him or her as having personhood. Again, i dont need to hear your opinions. If you want to prove your point, then produce evidence and i will believe you.  So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life. Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.  But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.  So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.  NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.",1,2
1479,"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws. Selling sex has to do with whether one has the freedom to choose in regards to their body which is however prevented by the laws.  You keep saying that the mother fetus relationship is parasitic but you are still failing to produce proper proof. The first evidence you produced is a blog. Who cares about a blog? Ablog is the exchange of information between people who talks about a subject. In the dictionary the term parasite was defined. Again anyone knows the definition of parasite so prove to me or produce any scientific findings that proved the fetus is a parasite. So far, you have failed to produce any proper evidence to prove that. All you keep doing is defining what the term parasite means and then applying it to the term fetus because of the existing relationship.   Source:   http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html                                           You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being. The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?  It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   Abortion again is the taking of a human life. Why do people not want to get pregnant? Because they are unable to accept responsiblity of the unborn for some reason or the other. So it is the process whereby the fetus is killed in a procedure.   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.",1,2
1480,"One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?  So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well? Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.  Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus? Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?  Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?   But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with? Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.",1,2
1481,"You said the fetus is not human then what is it? Again read up on Webster v. Rp  For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?  The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?",1,1
1482,"So are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? Then why are you even against abortion? We are talking about a life here not just a fetus. I believe that everyone has a right to live. No fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. In the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt.  If you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. What if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? What is your opinion on that?",1,2
1483,You are right. That's the same thing i believe in too. thank you.,1,2
1484,"For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?  The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?",1,2
1485,Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on? Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law. Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well. Whether you are dealing with science or business etc at some point you will have to abide by the instructions of the laws.  And again debating my friend is based on facts and research not just what you think.,1,2
1486,"If you did i will not question because i do not judge but it is as you say. That is referred to as political affairs and not laws. Laws are the rules that are to be followed upon in society, designed to control crime and to allow fair dealings in terms of crimes and business.",1,2
1487,And also if you define the term law then you would see that the definition of law is different from the definition of politics.,1,2
1488,I think so too. Every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. I am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the U.S Supreme Court in which all of the judges were men.,1,1
1489,"Didn't you develop from tissues and cells so what are you referring to? Furthermore if you hurt a person or wound them, does that not involve a damage of the cells, tissues and or organs as well? Isn't that is why they are charged with assault or attempted murder?",1,2
1490,And we have decided it is a crime because it results in causing injury to the person. Would we make it a law if it didn't cause damage to the body of the person?,1,2
1491,"So are you saying that because someone is not responsible to raise a child, we should kill that child? A human being with life? We keep thinking about the body of the mother but let us also think about the body of the unborn. So for every woman that is not ready, we should kill the child because of the foolishness of their actions? You are a human being and let us put it this way, would you want to pay for the mistake of someone whilst you are innocent?",1,1
1492,"What puzzles me is the fact that a mother can have an abortion but if someone else kills the mother and the child dies in her, then that person can be slapped with a charge of double homicide.",1,2
1493,Exactly i know why i made that statement. If the fetus does not have life then why does the state and the federal government institutes a charge of double homicide if the fetus dies through the death of the mother because according to those supporting abortion the fetus does not have life. Are the laws therefore wrong?,1,2
1494,Really check up back on the responses list and furthermore didn't you say there is no life in the fetus so why don't you trying answering why is there a double homicide charge there for the death of the fetus and the mother? So you are saying you asked this question so are a profile or prochoice because that question is a pro life question.,1,2
1495,Thank you very much for that point you made.   I was also born out of child pregnancy and poverty. Today i am a student in pre law with a G.P.A of 4.0 and also a straight A student. Should i have been aborted i would have been robbed of my life and accomplishments.,1,1
1496,Thank you for making that point. So infact we don't know what accomplishments these unborn can make but yet we want to abort them? What do you mean there is a much smaller chamce of being born into poverty? Do you read about poverty worldwide? Do you study world history or facts? Read up on thirdworld countries and poverty and pregnancy worldwide.   Also aveske himself told me i have potential to be a great debater so i don't need to explain myself to you. Ask him yourself.,1,1
1497,Only a hypocrite would act as if he is perfect. Neither me nor you are perfect. We as humans are prone to mistakes no matter what our intelligence levels are.,1,2
1498,Well yeah you are right but read up on the case which The U.S Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception. I think that is wrong in the whole to take a life. How many of us would even be here today if our parents had chosen abortion for us regardless of poverty or unpreparedness.,1,2
1499,"Really? Give me one reason why? So are you implying that when you were in the womb of your mother you were unworthy of human rights? We are talking about the ""life of a developing human being for your information"". Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to? For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?  That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.",1,2
1500,But it is growing into a human being? Am i right or wrong? You should understand that these cells are different from the other cells within our body. Cells that are developing with it's own genetic uniqueness and has its own DNA and blood type. Then why do the laws protects that very mass of cells by recognizing the homicide of a fetus as a separate offense if it is unworthy of human rights according to you?  Well that case i am referring to has a lot to do with this debate because it is a dispute on whether or not life begins at conception and it is a scientific controversy which resulted in the court ruling that life begins at conception after hearing arguments from both sides. So does a person who has Alzheimer is also not self aware which is why they are described as being in the baby stage? Well let us consider adoption instead of abortion and stop making it seem as if abortion is the only way out. Who is responsible for bringing them into existence? Did they asked to be brought into existence or to be related?,1,2
1501,"I did not intentionally banned him. Sorry about that. I dont ban people unless you start name calling and shift from public argument to personal argument. I mistook his name for the guy i wanted to ban. Why would i want to ban people that would give their opinions but anyway lets focus on your argument now.  Oh i was unprepared? Maybe you should have a look at our arguments and if i was unprepared for him, then how come i add him as my ally? I am not going to repeat myself because like i told aveske if the fetus is not a human then what is it? And doctors and the U.S Supreme Court has ruled that the fetus has life. I have proof of this. Lastly aveske referred to the fetus as a human organism. The deeper scientific meaning of the word organism refers to life so he himself referred to the fetus as human life.  And lastly if you read my arguments you would know that i debated this topic 10 times already and you would have learnt i am a student in criminal law.",1,2
1502,"oh and further more, all my arguments i had proof for aveske and if his arguments were indeed intelligent, then how come i had evidence to support my claim and i brought up every important point that he avoided?  And i am never unprepared because i am a student in criminal law again. These debates are nothing new for me. One thing i hate on here though is people give all sorts of opinions without evidence and expect them to be true.",1,2
1503,Oh and one more thing. If you say that organism refers to life then a human organism referred to as a fetus by doctors and also in the legal field will mean in other words human life? right?? because human organism (life according to you) can also be referred to as human life?,1,2
1504,"Really? Then if it's about a woman's right to control her own body, then why is it that the laws forbid her from controlling her own body when it comes to prostitution or the use of drugs? How come you guys are saying that a woman should have her own right to control her body but yet the laws prohibits us from committing suicide, the use of drugs or even prostitution? Doesn't these have to do with everybody's right to control their own body too?",1,2
1505,"Suicide is not banned but at the same time, the state has every right to keep a person in custody if there is a chance that the person will hurt himself or there is a strong likelihood that the person is at risk of committing suicide. Let us not concentrate on the federal level as we are concentrating on state levels. The duty of the federal level is to prosecute and regulate laws that are in the best interest in the people of America not just a specific state. In other words, the federal government cannot and will not intrude upon the laws of a state. Prostitution and suicide are minor issues for them when the security of their country is at stake.",1,2
1506,Really then if the father should not have a say then why when the child is born the father has to take the expenses of the child?,1,2
1507,Why don't you grow up? Do you think abortion is going to make people more responsible. I am not just out here throwing stuff because i want to. I am here because i believe it is wrong. Why don't you read up on Roe Vs. Wade. Do you want to know how abortion came into effect? Jane Roe presented to the Supreme Court that she was raped and the Supreme Court agree with her to have an abortion. It so turned out that she was never raped but she had consensual sex. Now she is against abortion. That is the story that created the legalization of abortion.  This is debating not about silly preferences. For you it is but not me. If it was would it be a national controversy? I don't even see a proper reason for your rebuttal except that it is childish. Would you say that to a District Attorney that he is childish because of what he believes in too?,1,2
1508,You kept saying that abortion is right? Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible? You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care. To me that is just childishness. How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest? If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion? Who looks more silly? Me or you? You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice? Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics. Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence. Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.   Try answering my questions and then we can continue this debate because i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance. If you are so skillful in researching the field of abortion then do me a favor and respond to the following questions;  When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.  Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?  What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?  How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?  Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?  If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts. If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified. Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.,1,2
1509,It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working? If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?  It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases. Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion. Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us. And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.,1,2
1510,"Frankly, anyone has the right to abortion because of free will and liberty, and nobody has the right to tell anyone what to do with their body.  HOWEVER,  The only problem I have is the definition of fetus and human.  If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human",1,2
1511,"It's probably because a pregnant woman is seen as being more vulnerable, and motherly, so killing such a person is especially heinous.   The vulnerability of a woman is completely irrelevant. So, vulnerability is your justification for double homicide of a pregnant woman with a fetus, yet a woman getting a abortion is not because the fetus is not human.  I am vulnerable of getting hit by a car walking the street, so should the driver of the car be charged with murder or manslaughter?",1,2
1512,"Abortion is not murder because a fetus is not a human. Therefore, abortion is legal",1,1
1513,"So, those, who were raped through the multiple varieties of means, are expected to birth this child although it was coerced rape. I don't think so.  Therefore, taking a woman's right to choice is wrong regardless what a church or the government suggests.",1,1
1514,"It is true that women who choose to engage in sex should think about their future before they do it, yet it is their body and freedom do with it as they please, and they have the responsible of making a decision, so if they choose sex, then at least, choose safe sex; otherwise, abortion is the real only option because society then will be paying through welfare. What is cheaper? Welfare or Abortion...?",1,1
1515,"I wish this Abortion debate would die, but it is the hot button issue in America, and it will continue.",1,1
1516,Abortion is invariably the decision of the woman because it is her body whether if the sex was consensual or rape. The government nor the Church has any right telling what a woman should do with her body. Abortion is acceptable because a fetus is not a baby.,1,1
1517,"Abortion is much cheaper than welfare queens. I hope your wallet is open wide because welfare queens are abundant from unprotected sex and lack of sex education and even lack of birth control pills, which would prevent most abortions from even occurring.",1,1
1518,I really not have to pay irresponsible teenagers with higher taxes compared to abortion.,1,1
1519,"Regardless of church dogma, abortion is and always be the woman's choice because it is her body, and not the government's, God's, The Church's or her significant other's.",1,1
1520,"I personally don't consider the fetus to be living. At least not in a way that matter. And it's considerably different to kill someone who already is living a life, than a fetus that simply has the possibility to live a life.",1,1
1521,"Abortion may be murder, it may not be. I personally don't care. I think abortion is an option that should always be kept open. I wouldn't want the burden of raising a child I can't raise, and I wouldn't want anyone to force me or anyone else to.  And before someone tells me adoption is another option, I personally wouldn't like always wondering who is raising my child, and if they're raising them okay. Or how I would want them to.",1,1
1522,"I don't want it shown because, unlike what you said, it's false. Abortion is NOT done like that anymore. Nor is it done this late unless the mother is in danger. Look it up.   And this picture is not gross to me, or disturbing. It's fake, and it's a ridiculous way to move people to be pro-life.  No pro-choice person has a problem with the picture itself, just that it's false.   Also, of course it would ""tug on your heartstrings"" the later a fetus is in term the more it is responsive. I don't have a problem with getting rid of a clump of cells in early abortion.",1,1
1523,I did do some research. And MOST states won't allow it to go this far.,1,1
1524,"I said said rarely, didn't I? I don't know what I put, but I meant it's rarely done like this.   It's not hard to look at for me.",1,2
1525,"It is not accurate. They don't use, the only word I can think to describe them, tongs. They use a vacuum now.   And I actually don't have a problem with any abortions. I just don't like that they use something that's illegal, and it is almost everywhere, though like everything illegal it's doesn't mean it doesn't happen, to convince people to change their minds.   I don't honestly care if it's alive or not, it's a burden, usually a complete accident and we're over-populated as it is. So abortion is a good choice in my opinion.",1,1
1526,So a child coming into an abusive family that can't take care of the baby isn't a good reason? It's okay for the child to suffer?,1,1
1527,"I'm sorry you regret your decision.  But I honestly believe that it is more selfish to trick yourself into thinking that you can care for a child, when you can't, and end up not giving the child the best life possible. THAT seems more selfish to me than letting go.   Also, adoption is not a choice some people can make, for personal reasons they don't want to do it, but yes, it is an other option, just not one for everyone.",1,1
1528,"Abortion is a way to prevent more poor families, suffering children, and used as back up when birth control fails.  I don't think anyone who used protection in sex should be saddled with a child. A child is a lot of work, and if you don't want the child then you both suffer for the next eighteen years.",1,1
1529,"That is stupid... -__- We've made sex safe, you can be on the pill and using condoms and it's the safest sex ever. And if you're using both properly then you are having safe sex. So have as much as you want, in my opinion. lol",1,1
1530,"Um, have you ever had sex? lol It's kind of fun. Not too mention it's great for relationships.   Sex isn't just for reproducing anymore. We've made it where we can have sex for pleasure.   It's narrow-minded to just think of sex just as reproducing. It's also no fun if you think of it just like that.",1,1
1531,"One of my friends says she's pro-abortion, and I pretty much agree. I'm not for a choice, though I""m for that too, but I""m also for abortion in the way that it should be used more frequently.",1,1
1532,"I honestly think it's more selfish to convince yourself into thinking you can raise a child when you have no means to, and not giving the child the best of life, than it is to simply not have the child. Not to mention I'm sick of seeing people who shouldn't be parents attempt it.",1,2
1533,"First of all, do you know what a comma or period is? Because your whole argument is just one huge sentence... Break it up.    Abortion is wrong sure there are instances that people think that it is right but it never is   It's not right even if the mother will die during childbirth? Or if it is a fact that the child will be born with a disorder that will make it suffer all it's life and die in only about ten years after birth? It's still wrong then?   give the baby up for adoption but still be apart of its life   Some people are against adoption in the same way you are against abortion. They simply can't go through with it. And you can't always be apart of it's life once you put it up for adoption, nor do some people want to.     I have noticed that the people that say abortion is right are alive and their parents didnt go through an abortion   ... This is the stupidest argument ever, if any parent did then it would irrelevant. And I have, on many occasions, which my mother had had another abortion when I was conceived. She suffered greatly by deciding to keep me and my twin brother, and I wish she had simply aborted us and lived a better life for herself.",1,1
1534,"There ARE too many people in the world. So let's just terminate all the useless ones, there are a lot :)",1,1
1535,"You have not made any argument for whether or not abortion should be considered morally wrong or not. So even if we were to dismiss his mental state and even if we were to accept that abortion ends a human life (which I wouldn't be inclined to do), we have no reason to believe that abortion is morally wrong.",1,1
1536,"Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   And so?   However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   Even if it may seem horrendous, it does not necessarily imply that it ought not to be allowed or done. All you have done here is simply appeal to emotion and given no logical arguments for your position.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions.   Really? Let's think about it then. If a mother is definitely going to die very slowly and painfully if the baby is not aborted, is it more immoral to abort the baby or allow the mother to die a slow and agonising death?  Let me raise another scenario. What if a minor was impregnated by a violent rape and the rapist does not take responsibility for the child? Is it more immoral to leave a defenceless and helpless minor to care for a baby, a constant psychological reminder of rape, or for her to abort? I'm not talking about who you would have more sympathy for, but merely on what moral grounds do you have to say abortion is immoral.  By logic, you yourself have no good reason to be opposed to abortion.",1,1
1537,"BUT you never know, that baby that was aborted could have been the next president or maybe the next singer everyone talks about.   Then again, is that a good argument? I could easily flip that around and say, ""Thank goodness person A aborted that baby because the baby that was aborted could have been the next Hitler, Pol Pot or Stalin or maybe the next Captain Francesco Schettino that everyone talks about."" The problem with such an argument is that we simply  do not  know what  might  or might  not  happen.",1,1
1538,"1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   You have made no argument to oppose abortion here. You have simply asserted without evidence that abortion is ""wrong"". Whether or not the rapist is caught has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not.   What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have?   It seems to me that the scenario he/she gave was very specific and we do know that the baby would have a bad quality of life at birth, making the chances of survival and access to opportunities very slim. Thus, you have no reason to play the sceptic card here.   Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   This is a red herring.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things.   Really? This is a hasty generalisation on your part. You have again asserted without evidence.   How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted   Mentally challenged people cannot be aborted because they have already been born.   My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives.   Another appeal to emotion.   Let me ask you this. Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   Another red herring.",1,1
1539,"Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.   Is the taking of a life  necessarily  wrong?   Do you think two wrongs make a right?   No. But I don't think that abortion is  necessarily  wrong. It is wrong in some situations, but it cannot be considered to be completely wrong.   Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   But you haven't explained why abortion is wrong. Saying that it is wrong because ""it takes a life"" doesn't say anything because you are making the assumption, without any justification, that taking a life is wrong.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?   I don't think that all life is sacred. I don't believe in the sanctity of life. That is merely an illusion. What you are  really  doing here is ignoring the rights of the mother in favour of the unborn child, whom we don't know will even survive birth or the first few years of its life.   Red Herring?   Yes, it is a red herring. In your previous comment, you haven't asserted how your Oprah Winfrey example supports your argument that abortion is immoral.   Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?   Not necessarily. I haven't made a judgement on Oprah at all so don't you dare put words in my mouth.   Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness, death, dying, troubles?   How does that support your view?   Do you think that mentally challenged, physically challenged people should have been aborted? If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…..should they be aborted? yes or no   Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   That has no relevance to whether the baby should have been aborted or not. Again, you can't abort an born child. That is an illogical statement. It's like asking the question, ""Should Person A, who is a bachelor, have gotten married?"" The question is wrong by definition. Thus, I don't have to answer questions that are logically incoherent in the first place.",1,1
1540,"You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.   I have never made this claim. You are putting words in my mouth.   You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.   That is because I don't think abortion is wrong  in every circumstance . I think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and/or under the wrong medical circumstances, making  some  abortion cases morally wrong.   I give it personhood   But the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly. If you want to argue on the basis of personhood, then a baby within the first trimester doesn't even have a brain to speak of. It, therefore, doesn't have the ability to  feel , let alone reason, within the first trimester.   War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   You are comparing the two wrongly. War is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself. Even if I were to accept that the unborn baby is a person (which is a view that I do not  necessarily  agree with, as I've explained above), then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life-threatening illness!   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL   I'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour. That just goes to show how frivolous you are. What a hypocrite. And, by the way, I don't think  human  life is sacred and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. If you think that life is sacred, then you, by logical deduction, should not be able to eat anything that has life (i.e. animals and even vegetables and fruits).   Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…   You are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through  during  the nine ""short"" months. Furthermore, you said ""allow something to live"", right? If the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother, then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the MOTHER to live. If you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby, are you doing what is ""right""?   AFter conception it is a separate human being   It is not. As I have explained, the baby is not a human being within the first trimester. Furthermore, the unborn baby, no matter at any stage, is dependent on it's mother  completely  for nutrition. In other words, the baby is, technically speaking, a  parasite . The Oxford English Dictionary defines a ""parasite"" as ""Biol. An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and draws its nutriment directly from it. Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" Thus, by definition, the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body  AT THE EXPENSE OF HER OWN HEALTH .   How barbaric and cold is that?   Which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not. Or whether it should be legal or not. This is simply an appeal to emotion.   It should not matter whether the child will make it or not.   Then, whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you. Pro-choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision. They do NOT promote abortion, simply the  legalisation  of abortion. If you can't see the difference, then you're an idiot.   Abortion is premeditated killing.   And so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live. If the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, by not aborting the child, you are also premeditating the killing of the mother. Thus, by your standards, you face a paradox. I am appalled by how people can call themselves ""pro-life"" when they say that the mother's life doesn't matter as long as the baby is not aborted. This is hypocrisy of the greatest degree.   Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….   I am not a ""pro-abort"". I am pro-choice, as I have explained the difference.   So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery. Thus, you are attacking a straw man. Poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been ""allowed to survive"" face.   You said this….""Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy  and self-consciousness.""  Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.   Of course it does. It has autonomy and self-consciousness. But then again, even if I agree with you, by saying that a newborn baby can't have such experiences, it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral. Thus, your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer is ""no"". Congratulations, you have proven that you at least have  some  level of intelligence.",1,1
1541,"Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus?   First, I doubt that you can call the use of contraception ""irresponsible"". The fact that the contraception failed to prevent pregnancy does not mean that the parents were irresponsible, they were merely unlucky.  Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life. According to the OED, a zygote refers to ""A body of living protoplasm, as a cell or cell-nucleus, formed by the conjugation or fusion of two such bodies in reproduction; a zygospore, or any germ-cell resulting from the union of two reproductive cells or gametes."" While I admit that the zygote is ""alive"" in that sense, it does not have human rights because a zygote is not a sentient human being.",1,1
1542,"So to have sex, even with protection, one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes, however unlikely.   Even if that is the case, I doubt that you can suggest that parents who use contraception are ""irresponsible"".   A zygote has the DNA of a homo sapien.   It possess the DNA of a homo sapien, no doubt. But it is not a homo sapien.   It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead.   Didn't I say that I agree it is alive?   Life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the OED.   You are committing the genetic fallacy here.   Did you think I wouldn't notice your clever addition? It is a human being (organism).    Yes, it is a human being and I don't argue against that. But is it sentient? In other words, does it possess rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciouness?",1,1
1543,"If they are not prepared for the consequences, then yes.   But to declare them to be irresponsible, by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like, would be presumptuous.   You added a ""technically"" in there which expressed hesitance and some doubt. But this is a good start.   ""Technically"" does not  necessarily  imply hesitance and doubt. I used it in the sense of ""by definition"".   Apparently we are stuck at the human=homo sapien part.   No, we aren't. A zygote may be alive, but it is not a homo sapien.   For example, the colloquial definition of a ""theory"" and a scientific definition of a ""theory"" are completely different.   Which has no bearing on whether the OED's definition is true or not. I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's. You raised the example of ""theory"". According to the OED, a ""theory"" refers to ""A conception or mental scheme of something to be done, or of the method of doing it; a systematic statement of rules or principles to be followed"" or ""A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed."" Tell me, which of these two definitions are not inline with the scientific definition?   Irrelevant. I have no interest in arguing the difference in morality between two identical organisms whose inly difference is mental and physical development.   Then this debate isn't for you. Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive. The concept of sentience  is  one of the bedrocks of the abortion debate. If you are not willing to address this issue, then you shouldn't even be debating here in the first place.",1,1
1544,"How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   semantics...   Hey, you were the one who wanted to play this game ;)   And I can give many that are not.   Therefore, you are committing the genetic fallacy. Because whether or not the definition comes from the OED has no bearing on whether the definition is true or not. I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.   Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged? I am well justified to go down this road.",1,1
1545,"What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex.   Just like how the Japanese chose to settle in Japan. If there's an earthquake and many people die or are injured in any way like the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, is it their fault? Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I said serious defect.   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for, if you have even bothered to distill my previous arguments. Therefore, I don't understand why you are rebutting me.   It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop.   So what? That was not my point. What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.",1,1
1546,"It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally.   You are attacking a straw man. I did not say that having a baby was an accident. I was saying that the failure of contraception was an accident. The failure of contraception might not lead to pregnancy, no matter how high the probability. If you were to argue this point, you would be going down a very slippery slope. Furthermore, an appeal to nature is hardly a cogent argument.   The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring.   I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Nope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   And none of which are usually fatal.   You are attacking another straw man argument. I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong. The point is that if an organism lacks rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciousness, it is no more than a mechanical machine that can be terminated without such an act being considered morally wrong.   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   Did I even make that point?   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.   Right. This is purely an assertion without justification.",1,1
1547,"So either  1) you do indeed think it is an accident  OR  2) Your analogy fails as it is being compared to a straw man.   You are attacking a straw man here again. I said that the failure of contraception was an accident, not pregnancy.   They knew it is possible and they are at fault for ignoring all the possibilities.   By that same standard, you are also pushing the blame of the damage caused by the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake completely on the Japanese. If you have the audacity to claim that, I would say that you have less knowledge of Geography that my 5 year old nephew.   How does human not equal homo sapien?   I don't believe that was what I said. Homo sapien is a species of animals. To be human, one must also possess personhood. According to Dr. Mianna Lotz from the Centre of Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, whom I've had the pleasure to meet recently, ""Personhood is generally defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.""   I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   Conversely, even when the effect of an action is fatal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action itself was wrong.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.   That is an extremely feeble argument. How can someone ignore unforeseen circumstances?",1,1
1548,"Is it in dispute then that abortion causes disgust?   Even if it does cause disgust, there are still two logical fallacies with this line of argument. First, it doesn't cause disgust to  everyone . And second, any appeal to emotion is irrelevant to whether something is right or wrong.",1,1
1549,"I rather you but out unless you'd like to discuss how to (not just how not to)logically establish whether something is wrong or right.   There isn't any easy way to establish whether something is ""right or wrong"". But, a judgement on whether something is ""right or wrong"" is a judgement based on moral  duties . However, any judgement as such should be supported by arguments that fulfill both truth conditions.",1,1
1550,"I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   How is this relevant to the debate at hand?   I am antichoice abortion.   Wait. You're against women and/or parents having a choice, but you are pro-abortion now? Or that you want abortion without giving people a choice?   It is simply using the space to grow.   Not only that. The unborn fetus also uses it's mother's body for nutrition.   It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother.   And thus, the mother has the right to  un invite it.   I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear.   If you say this, that means you're deluded.   Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion.   Again, short answer is ""yes"", long answer is ""no"".   That is not pro-life   You aren't pro-life as well if you will not allow a mother, whose life is threatened by the pregnancy, to abort the baby.   ""I am pro-choice but I am against abortion""…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.   You're myopic and deluded.   Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?   No. I am pro-choice but I do not condone abuse, slavery or genocide.   I am not happy.   I don't give a damn.   I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold.   So what? That says nothing about whether or not they  ought  to be done.   Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position.   I would say the same to you, but I realised now that you're myopic, closed minded and intolerant of the beliefs of others.",1,2
1551,"Since you haven't disputed my other arguments on the other end, I shall simply respond to this one.   If having a child would be burden, then having sex is a terrible idea.   Which says absolutely nothing about abortion is morally right or wrong.   Sex is intentional.   Obviously, sex involves two parties. Thus, your idea of whether sex is intentional or not would depend on whose perspective you are taking.   In nature, it is meant to result in fertilization. It is not an ""accident,"" it is what is supposed to happen.   Again, you are misconstruing what can be considered an ""accident"". Just because it occurs ""in nature"" doesn't mean that it is not an accident. An earthquake could be natural. And it could be natural for buildings to collapse during an earthquake event. It could even be that the debris of the collapsing buildings kill people and cause other loss of property. However, does it necessarily mean that it is not an accident.",1,1
1552,"Why should someone be killed for anther person's mistake?   Is the fetus a person?   The entire purpose of sex is for fertilization to occur. It isn't an ""accident"" at all.   You are misconstruing my words again. I said that the failure of contraception was an accident. I didn't say that the pregnancy was an accident.  And even if I were to allow you the concession that the accident wasn't an accident, that simply doesn't say  anything  about whether or not abortion is morally wrong or not. To say that it is wrong because the pregnancy wasn't an accident would be to commit the genetic fallacy.   An Earthquake isn't the fault of the people liven near it.   This is  exactly  why you are never coming near refuting my arguments. An earthquake wasn't caused by the people, that's true. But where the people lived was the choice of the people. If you put the blame on the parents for an unwanted pregnancy, it would be equivalent to blaming the people who died in an earthquake that resulted in loss of lives and property even though there are aseismic measures and evacuation plans put in place.",1,1
1553,"You can't be both. You either want abortions legal…or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal.   This reveals the simplicity of your thoughts. You can be both. There are good reasons to believe why abortion should only be legal within the first trimester only.   Thats like child abuse.   This is a textbook example of a false analogy. A fetus is not the equivalent of a child.   It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped.   Yes it does. There have been studies of how the children of rape victims are negatively affected in terms of their psychological development, especially if there is a missing parent.   We live in a sexually active society.   We have always lived in a sexually active society. If our society is sexually inactive, the human race would have been extinct by now.   More couples live together today than get married.   I don't see your point. Married couples live together. And you can choose to live together first and get married later. It has no bearing on whether abortion is right or wrong.   We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant.   And who is ""the deviant""?   Kids know about sex earlier than ever today.   That's good! I'd rather have my kids know about sex earlier and learn how to protect themselves than to be ignorant and cause unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of knowledge.   It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for.   I can say the same about you. What you are positing here are feeble challenges. So feeble, in fact, I wonder if your heart is even in this debate.",1,2
1554,"I am quite sick of abortion debates, so I'll write my three strongest arguments for abortion and let's see if any of you ""pro-life"" people can rebut them. While many people have formulated different arguments for abortion (some better than others), not all of them are grounded in the concept of  sentience . Unlike them, all of my three arguments do, at least, relate to the concept of sentience.   1. The Sentience Argument   1. Only a being that is conscious and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain can be said to have interests.  2. A sentient, and therefore morally significant, being is one with an interest in continued life.  3. Ergo, only a sentient being can be said to perhaps have a  right  to life. (From (2) )  4. Normal human foetus begins to possess a rudimentary capacity for sentience in the  second  trimester.  5. Ergo, an early term foetus is  NOT  a being with an interest in its own continued life. (From (3) and (4) ) (Or, Only a human foetus from the second trimester on can perhaps be said to have a right to life)  6. Ergo, an early term human foetus (i.e. foetus in the first trimester) does  not  have a right to life (from (5) )  7. Ergo, an early term abortion is morally permissible (from (6) ).   2. The Utilitarian Argument   1. Different sentient beings experience differing degrees or intensities of experiences such as suffering.  2. The prospect of death and dying is a more intense experience for a sentient being that possesses capabilities such as foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  3. Ergo, the principle of respect for the interests of sentient beings does not imply that all sentient beings have an equal right to life. (from (1) and (2) )  4. A foetus, sentient or otherwise, does not possess foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  5. Ergo, a sentient foetus may be accorded lesser moral significance than the sentient adult human being in whose body it gestates. (from (3) and (4) )  6. Ergo, the suffering experienced by a sentient late term foetus terminated through abortion, would be less than the suffering experienced by the pregnant woman, a sentient being, were she forced to continue with the pregnancy. (from (1), (2) and (4) )  7. Ergo, a sentient pregnant woman has a greater right to life than a (sentient) foetus. (from (3) and (6) )  8. Ergo, a late term abortion is morally permissible (from (7) )   3. The Personhood Argument   1. Personhood is defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.  2. It is more seriously morally impermissible to kill a person than a non-person, even a sentient non-person.  3. An early-stage foetus possesses little, if anything, in the way of consciousness, self-conceptualisation, reasoning and communication abilities.  4. Ergo, focuses are not persons (from (1) and (3) )  5. Ergo, foetuses cannot possess interests or rights, including the right to life (from (4) )  6. Ergo, it is not morally impermissible to kill them (from (5) ).  You might have noticed that in all three of my arguments, my conclusions are not necessarily the same. I am  not  advocating for a convergence in conclusion when I posit these arguments. I am merely stating three (quite) good arguments for abortion.",1,1
1555,"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.   Of course it doesn't disqualify them from being considered human. But it  does  mean that they are not persons, i.e. they do not possess the essential characteristics of personhood, which are rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.   But you haven't stated whether abortion, in such unfortunate circumstances, are right or wrong.   3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.   On the contrary, this  is  an issue of whether you would consider abortion as murder or not. Furthermore, you yourself seem to think that this issue is paramount to the debate since you went on to talk about the legalisation of murder and used that as an analogy.   4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.   My question to you is: is abortion morally acceptable?   5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?   You seem to forget that rape is also never the fault of the  victim . With this being true, how can you deny the victim/mother-to-be the right to make choices concerning her own body if it is not her fault in the first place?",1,1
1556,"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.",1,1
1557,"I am only saying that abortion involves the killing of an innocent human being.   That is not completely true. You are assuming that the fetus is an innocent human being. Furthermore, even if I agree with you that the assumption is true, there is no reason on your part to suggest that abortion is wrong.   If you believe that it is morally acceptable to kill innocent human beings, that is morality for you. No one can ""prove"" morality to someone who does not accept certain basic warrants.   That is a lazy answer. This is exactly why I am asking you to provide reasons to support your unasserted claims.",1,1
1558,Of course I agree that innocent human life should not be killed. But that is quite different from saying abortion isn't morally correct or that it should not be legal.,1,1
1559,"The short answer is ""yes"", the long answer is ""no"". You are misconstruing the ideas of being a Homo sapien and being a person. An unborn fetus is not a human. That is like trying to say that an acorn is an oak tree. If one can claim such a thing, that is delusional.  It certainly is worthy of life. But that does not mean that abortion is morally wrong or it should not be legal. All you are doing here is throwing out pointless questions.",1,1
1560,"Honestly, your statement is both unintelligible and unintelligent.   there are ways the baby can have different parents that can raise it.   What are you saying here? Are you actually suggesting that the baby has a  choice  in the matter?   It shouldn't be legal   An unjustified assertion.",1,1
1561,"No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it.   It is both.   Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion.   That is obviously a hasty generalisation. I would think that in many cases, babies born with fatal birth defects or, at least, defects that can tragically affect their lives (such as cerebral palsy) will not experience an alleviation of their pain and suffering no matter who their parents are. How can you say that I am rushing to ridicule when you haven't even seen my perspective on this issue?   He presented an alternative that doesn't involve an unnecessary surgery and in which the life of the developing child is cherished instead of treated like trash.   Now, you have made a few unjustified assertions. You have claimed that abortion is an ""unnecessary"" surgery. You have also claimed that parents treat the life of their developing child like trash. Both of these claims are unasserted.",1,2
1562,"Even if it was.   You sound sceptical. Why?   Your statement was rude and counterproductive.   I think it was harsh, not rude. But maybe we have a different threshold for rudeness. I don't think it was counter-productive. It certainly got your attention. However, if we were going to enter into such a petty debate, it would indeed be counterproductive.   No it takes into account that most abortions are not due to medical necessity.   This is argumentum ad populum. Even if this  was  true, it doesn't necessarily mean that abortion  ought  not to be legal.   Because you offered your scathing critique of Silaswash's writing style and left your response absent of anything that would give a clue as to your perspective regarding the subject being discussed.   Ah, but what a decent person does is ask for clarification, isn't it?   I didn't claim they all were.   You didn't say they weren't. All you asserted was that abortion is an unnecessary surgery.   Well they are certainly not given a burial   So what? A child could be killed by a parent through abuse and still be given a proper. In such a case, does it mean that just because the child was given a proper burial it necessarily meant that he/she wasn't treated like trash?",1,2
1563,"I really just wanted to stick up for silaswash since I think it was your comment that sent him away from a site he potentially had much to gain from.   And the proof of your accusation is? Honestly, you can't be expecting me to just bend over and take that from you, right?  Furthermore, if you are trying to stick up for silaswash, why haven't you answered any of my criticisms yet?",1,2
1564,"It was just a hunch   Was it  only  a hunch?   No I expect you to all of the sudden stop being condescending to people.   Well, that doesn't answer the question.   Cause I only care so much you know.   Well if you don't care a lot, then why would you attempt to defend his view, or him, at all?",1,2
1565,"It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns.   Bullshit. Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings, won't you?   But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite. According to the OED, the scientific definition of a parasite is ""An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and  draws its nutriment directly from it . Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" (Emphasis my own)  All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her. Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply  dis allowing the fetus to continue living within her.   No one should have the right to kill innocent people.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.",1,1
1566,"Any creature with a nervous system has ""feelings"", what I am referring to are thoughts and emotions.   Are you saying that a new born does not have thoughts and/or emotions?   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.   I did not say that the fetus is not a Homo sapien. No fair minded person will accuse me of saying such a thing.   Thus killing a human being.   So? You have not shown that this is morally wrong in any way.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of ""parasite"" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?   I said that fetuses are parasites. But I did  not  say that they are not Homo sapien. Get your facts right. For example, a tick can both be considered an arthropod and a parasite.  In any case, you still haven't shown that abortion is morally wrong.",1,1
1567,"That is Old testament life was more strict back then but if you have ""read"" the New Testament in the Bible you would have learned we are all set free from the Old Testament.",1,2
1568,You need a better interpreter then me but i will give it my best. Jesus here is speaking that the Old Testament was speaking of his coming. (verses 17-18)  In verse 19 he is talking about the 10 Commandment. When Jesus was crucified it ended some of the laws in the Old Testament not including the 10 Commandments.  Here is a link to that:  http://www.gotquestions.org/ Christian-law.html,1,2
1569,You do not understand the Word of God because you are taking everything literally. If you would actually study the Bible and have someone interpret it for you because obviously you do not understand the true meaning. Yet you still criticize me for going to a different source for evidence other then the Bible even though you want me to use different sources. Explain.,1,2
1570,"Lots of parts in the Bible are literal but there are that have a different meaning then what stands out. Jesus said a lot of parables that contained a specific meaning. A lot of science is correct except evolution, the big bang, etc... Your are not a Christian at least for now so your understanding of the Bible is not as great as mine.",1,2
1571,God did not kill any babies so you should maybe study the Bible and ask someone to interpret it for you because obviously you do not understand.,1,2
1572,Like i said you need someone to interpret the Bible for you so...  Here is a link:  http://www.godandscience. org/apologetics/ notkill.html#r0N2AWDBfggn,1,2
1573,I like what the Bible says. Some things in the Bible makes me sad but it is the truth so i fallow it. You are not understanding. You probably did not even read the link. You're the one who says the Bible is a lie so you need other evidence. That is what i just did and you criticize me for not going to the Bible for information.,1,2
1574,The offspring of the corrupted will also be corrupted. The flood for example every one was corrupt except Noah and his family. Sodom and Gomorrah God gave Abraham to find righteous people the number lowered until finally God said find 10 righteous people Abraham could not and so was the destruction of the cities. Before the cities were destroyed God sent and Angel to worn the righteous people which was only lot and his family which still were not to righteous but they were righteous enough that they listened to the Angel and left. These are only a 2 examples.,1,2
1575,Would you want to be killed??????????????????????????????,1,2
1576,A baby does not become a mass murderer because it decided it when he is born. A main cause is when the child experiences a tragic time in his/her life.,1,2
1577,Well i know the baby could be a mass murderer but most people do not grow up as a mass murderer. The chances are slim but you are right it is possible.,1,2
1578,so what if it doesn't have a brain yet still is going to get one and still has a whole future in front of him/her.,1,2
1579,Abortion is wrong and it is killing an innocent life...................................,1,2
1580,Stop trying to turn around words to make it sound like something else.,1,2
1581,So you are saying that we are all unworthy of life since we were all once undeveloped?,1,2
1582,"No the question is what do you not understand. You are the one saying that an undeveloped human hasn't the rights of a developed human an yet we were all once ""undeveloped"" so we technically have no rights since we were undeveloped. So you would not care if your parents decided that oh we want an abortion because it is undeveloped so it does not have the rights that we developed humans do.",1,2
1583,So you are saying a fetus is not human and it is undeserving to live and yet we were all once a fetus and we are living. Abortion is depriving that human of experiencing life.,1,2
1584,"It will still come to feel pain, think comprehend, and has more life ahead of him/her then a 12 year old.",1,2
1585,"Why would you ever describe a human as a parasite. Apparently we are nothing but   but a bunch of disease ridden single celled organisms. First of all we cannot be parasites because we are multi-cellular organisms, an unborn baby is still a human, it is okay if it dies by natural causes but on purpose to kill it is just wrong.",1,2
1586,But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion. Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive. Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born?,1,2
1587,Abortion is killing a life. Why is it illegal to kill a human life at 1 years old and it is legal to kill a human life before it is born before it has a chance to see the wonders of this world. Those who support abortion are just as guilty as those who go through with abortion! I REST MY CASE,1,2
1588,Abortion is murder and those who support it obviously think murder is okay.,1,2
1589,That is not a human or an animal it is a plant. Killing a plant is okay especially weeds. It should be considered murder to kill a baby before it is born though. It is a living human just because it isn't out and about doesn't mean that its not a living organism.,1,2
1590,Weeds and other plants have no soul o who cares if they die as long as there is enough so that we can survive i think it is wrong to kill and animal for the fun of it.   A weed is not an animal because of the traits any kindergarten kid knows that.,1,2
1591,Killing an unborn baby is murder it is still a life why does it make a difference if the baby is born or unborn it is still a baby and a life.,1,2
1592,I see Mr. Charlie Brown has decided to speak. I guess i have to be a little bit more simple because i thought these people were masters in understanding the words of other people. Instead of saying life i will say human life instead okay. Is that better now.,1,2
1593,Murder is when someone kills another person unlawfully (short definition).,1,2
1594,I know abortion is legal but in MY OPINION it should be ILLEGAL. Therefore i was using MY words accurately in MY statement.,1,2
1595,It is just an opinion to me just like it is your opinion that abortion is okay. I believe abortion to be murder while you don't. It is just opinions.,1,2
1596,It is just an opinion to me just like it is your opinion that abortion is okay. I believe abortion to be murder while you don't. It is just opinions.,1,2
1597,It is opinions i am not the only who thinks abortion is wrong. The people who want abortion is their opinion. Abortion got voted in because the majority of the people's opinions supported it.,1,2
1598,Right now you are the one who cannot comprehend this.   As of right now abortion is legal. Other people though do not agree (like me) that abortion SHOULD be legal. Murder is an unlawful killing. I am saying it is people opinions. They MAY BELIEVE abortion is okay and some MAY NOT it is their OPINION.,1,2
1599,are you serious it doesn't matter if the baby doesn't have an age or if he / she is 15 you should never be able to kill a life,1,2
1600,"I am sorry if I'm ""forcing"" my opinion on people saying you better believe or else... if i am tell me and i will try to be more easy going. I just want people to come to God other wise they will perish. Its hard to explain Christians just have this feeling they not what they say is right but it is very hard to try to prove it. People now a days want pure you can see evidence but if people would just start seeing with there hearts more then they would realize they were missing out of even more wonderful things. I know what i say is the truth, I have that deep down in my gut feeling that what i speak is truth about God and Christianity.",1,2
1601,A foetus is equal to all of us every human should treated equally born or unborn.,1,2

1605,Yes.  So was pulling the weeds on my front lawn last weekend. Was that murder too?,1,1
1606,"And you think animals DO have souls? Your parents told you your pet puppy went to puppy heaven didn't they?

1607,"Are you familiar with the phrase ""making an argument""?  For example... if you say ""It is murder if you end a life"" and I point out an example of ending a life which is CLEARLY NOT MURDER, thus demonstrating that the criteria you listed for classifying something as murder was incorrect... that is what some people refer to as ""debunking a claim"".  When you catch up, let me know and we can talk.",1,1

1609,"Actually, how about you try and actually define murder instead. You clearly don't know what the word means if you think ""ending human life"" is what it is.",1,1
1610,"Sorry, doesn't work that way. You thinking something SHOULD be murder doesn't make it accurate to say it IS murder just because you want it to. Although I should have anticipated you would have difficulty with this concept since you seem to be of the general opinion that all of your beliefs re-shape reality around you and that anything you believe in is true because you think it is.  Or, in other words, you live in a world of self-constructed delusions.",1,1
1611,"No, genius, it is NOT just opinions. The law is a real thing that doesn't depend on your freaking opinion.  You thinking something should be illegal DOESN'T MAKE IT ILLEGAL. You really need to step outside your personal little fantasy world and deal with reality.",1,1

1613,"1. The defining characteristic of a person is sapience. You need thought. You need self awareness. And to get those things you need a functioning brain. Since there is no coherent brain activity in early fetal development until AT LEAST 22 weeks we are most certainly not dealing with anything we could meaingfully call a person prior to that time. And since something like 97% of all abortions occur in that window and any occuring after it are almost always for reasons of medical necessity that alone should end this discussion.  2. EVEN IF we insisted on calling a fetus a person before then. Hell, even if we called it a person from the second it was conceived even though calling a few undifferentiated cells a ""person"" is insane... that still wouldn't be an arument for outlawing abortion since that requires declaring that the mother has no legal right to control over her own body. That it is superceded by another ""person's"" right to use her body for their own preservation. That is not a right that exists in our society. That right is possessed by NOBODY, and for good reason. I sure as hell cannot commandeer your body against your will to preseve my life. Nobody can walk up to you and force you to have surgery to give up a peice of your liver or some bone marrow because I need it to survive and my ""right to life"" trumps your right to have final say on what happens to your body.   If we do that we define people as community property. Which is what outlawing abortion based on arguments that the mother   doesnt have the right to say   if her body gets used to carry a child to term would be doing. It's despicable.  There is no justification fr outlawing abortion. Regulating it, yes. Placing reaosnable restrictions on late-term occurances, yes. Outlawing? Absolutely not. It must be legal.",1,1

Besides being a silly criteria in and of itself, you do realize that the fetus doesn't stop being part of something else until the umbilical is cut?  There is one defining criteria of people that makes them people. It is very obvious what it is. ""Cogito ergo Sum"" isn't just a catchy saying.

Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep? after all you will eventually demonstrate sapience when you wake up, which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience. well sleeping your moments are similar to the kicking a fetus may have, they are not a demonstration of sapience. The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?    If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it. combine that with the complications above and this seem to be quite muddled. So the question seems to me to be more of weather our laws and philosophies behind them should be consistent and if they are not then it is not principles but rather utility they are based on. In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.",1,2
1660,"""Life"" please specify what you mean by the word ""life"". technically a fetus is indeed alive, a zygote is alive.   Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.  Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.   Before conception, during it, after it etc Life never wasn't during a ""successful pregnancy"". 2 haploids of two different beings came together, forming a third being. keep in mind a being is distinct from person.",1,2
1661,"Abortion is not murder. I never forgot that. I was attacking the argument from sapience not debating weather it is ethical to deny the existence of a hypothetical being. your commentary isn't relative to what i posted.   it is ethical to deny someone's or rather some human being's existence before they exist. It is ok to wear a condom. any such person being stopped from existing is just hypothetical. A fetus isnt a person, it is a human being. however just what the hell is a person? abortion gets down to questions that have been disputed for hundreds of years, and to this day don't possess satisfactory answers.   A fetus is undeniably alive by the way, it just doesn't demonstrate sapience and can not. Expanding the scope of the argument leads to problems, showing that the argument from sapience is only valid with ""but"", ""ifs"" etc which would contradict the argument. Is a baby born less then one day ago really sapient? if not, why not be able to put it in a dumpster. It does not have a choice of its own, and does not seem very ""person"" like. Thus it fits the criteria and people should have the ability to kill it, for it is very dependent on a care taker(s) and what right does it have to impose on anyone? This is just one of many examples.",1,2
1662,"Fetuses are capable of responding to stimuli. brain development begins in the early embryonic period or at week 5 of pregnancy  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ prenatal-care/PR00112    later on as a fetus they can sense and respond, they can kick and punch.

The question asked is the following: Will banning it decrease crashes? the word ""will"" is a reference to the future.   Disposing of a used condom is disposing of your own haploids(sperm). it has nothing to do with abortion and is why its not considered abortion.  what is meant by individuality? the zygote has its own dna pattern. it is individual, unique. I have a feeling you mean something different?  the first two weeks of pregnancy your not actually pregnant according to the first article mentioned in the above, there is most certainly nothing wrong with doing something with in that time period to insure you don't become pregnant.   If the laws don't parade themselves as philosophical or moral beacons Then lets say its pragmatic and that there isn't really a justification for it other then people in control find it useful.Then theres this entire other issue of control but thats a different debate.   Laws do indeed parade themselves as philosophical and moral beacons though, common law is a perfect example. Previous court cases and the reasoning behind them can have significant impact on a case. Also the common criticism of a action as immoral is that it is illegal. This common criticism isn't a good one because legality is no substitute for morality but its there because the law is seen in culture as a beacon of what is right.",1,1
1663,"Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.  That is NOT my reasoning. I have some tests coming up so i won't respond immediately perhaps this weekend I'll write something up summarizing my position. Responding and not stating may of lead to confusion. My responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making, not a argument for or against abortion themselves.

I likely won't get on this website till then, or Friday.",1,2
1664,"Ok, this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience:   The argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as Barbra(or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument) and is as follows  1.All non-(Human persons) are beings which do not have rights.  2.All fetuses are non-(human persons).  --------------------------------------- -------------------------   3.Therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights.   This is indeed Barbara (and a disjunctive syllogism):   1.All A are B  2.All C are A  --------------------------------------- --------------------------   3.All C are B  The soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non-(human persons) which is dependent on the category of person.    This category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on:   1.A human person is a human being   2.A human person is a human being with the quality of personhood.   This forces us to look into personhood, so lets look into it:  1.Personhood is dependent on the brain,   A. How developed of a brain?    I. How is this decision decided or development measured? Likely by what functions the brain can accomplish, then the importance of those functions would have to be supported.   II. If the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows:   AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.   BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?  In less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do.   Most brain functions change with time. If we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are.  Keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a “human person” from birth to death is hypothetical, that human beings stop and start being “human persons” at times and still retain their rights. Also human beings which lack basic brain functions, such as babies( object permanence, for example. which many animals possess), possess rights. Thus the argument from sapience is unsound. Premise one is not true.  The truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood. The definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation. thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is, no reason to give . This is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such.  Jean piaget(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Jean_Piaget)  tells us that human beings don't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7. We lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2. We also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in-till we reach a later age. It would be difficult to consider anyone a “human person” with out the last 2 abilities.  Also i must mention, fetuses are simply human. There is no such thing as sub-human. The idea of sub-human is a horrible one. It suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top, and because of humanities “superiority”(superiority according to what standard?) they are allowed the ability to do what would otherwise be dis-moral(which seems like a non-sequitur to me).",1,2
1665,"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?  I decided to make up names/categories because i don't know already established names for these concepts. they are defined as they come up, feel free to suggest alternative names.  If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.   However because rights are awarded to human beings which lack even basic brain functions and that it would be very difficult to define personhood in such a way to non-arbitarily include only human-beings in pre-birth periods of development as having non-person-hood then AFS might as well be considered unsound and thus inconclusive on weather fetuses have rights.    Another argument whose conclusion is the following: That all human beings which lack a brain/braintissue also lack rights (lets call it Argument from um... biology? AFB) would have nothing to say on any human beings with a brain or with any brain tissue. AFB would be sound from my first analysis of it. . another argument stating that there is a certain amount of brain development required would have something to say on all human beings which do not reach the period of development(Lets call this argument the up-till-a-point argument or UPA).  your #2 is a very good insight for It would be very beneficial to distinguish between parts of the brain which give rise to consciousness, awareness, etc(C-functions) and which just simply pump the heart, work the lungs, etc(H-functions). If it can be shown that H-functions are the only functions present till a certain point then that point would be a very good point to use for the UPA argument.   all three of the above arguments come in the form of Barbara.( I forgot to put a 'a' in-between the 'b' and 'r' in my last post.) thus if someone disagreed with them they would have to attack their premises.   I like how you pick your sources, very good.  I like number 3. I think science needs to be used more in legal matters. It too often seems like politicians yelling at each other and not backing themselves up by empirical methods.  a sort summery of my criticism on the AFS is that some brain functions, like awareness disappear nightly. sleeping would constitute aberrant behavior of awareness; however it reappears when one awakes. If a certain level of awareness must be demonstrated for a human being to be a person then person-hood is lost nightly along with rights since AFS considers them dependent on person-hood.This is not the case in actuality, people maintain rights despite sleeping. If awareness must be within a statistical likelihood of occurring within a certain amount of time, aka capable; then those constraints would be arbitrary and why they are chosen would need to be shown superior to other constraints like a longer period of time(9 months) or such in order to be more acceptable then a similar argument with different constants(a fetus being a hypothetical person and thus deserving of rights for example, similar because a sleeping human-being would also constitute a hypothetical person) . awareness also seems like one of those things which would have to be included in person-hood, in order for it to have much value.",1,1
1666,"It seems we may of been arguing definitions  Free thinking and free will are synonyms to me; as is perspective and mindset. mindset can be seen as a perspective with a positive feedback loop.  The mind is a beautiful thing full of feedback loops and self modifying. It is bounded by its original state and its environment. If all one starts with in life is instinctual behavior then there is a chain of reaction in all their ""decisions"" which amount to them being based on instinctual behavior. I can write some javascript code which is selfmodifying in such a way which changes how it modifys itself based off of previous modifcations. The exact way to do this would take some time though. currently i'm working on a automatic logical analysis of statements to access their validity; which means i'm looking at their structure and seeing if there are any possible ways the premises could all be true and the conclusion false. I won't have much time to work on either one till summer though which is a roughly a month away. a self-modifying function which changes how it modifies based on previous modifications sounds like a challenge but i know its possible for programs have been evolved and not made before in other languages and thats essentially what i would be doing. i might work some on it but it won't be a high priority project. matter of fact i just found this site yesterday and i need to spend less time on it. I'm in love with argumentation, call it my addiction. i went on a tangent back to the different points.  My spiritual existence is only valid under determinism. This may require more explaining but might be best made a separate debate.  consciousness is an emergent property of a electro-chemical machine, it is the same as the polarity of water.   freewill and freethought both suggest that a human being can be a first cause that their decisions are neither random nor determined. A human being is not a god. Although god is an ambiguous word and in one sense i can say that, and in another sense i can say i am my own god. Perhaps god is a word which should be avoided in debate due to its ambiguity.  Abortion constitutes many other debates, it is a debate which rests upon many other debates. I have unique viewpoints upon those debates and i find most other people to be inconsistent when it comes towards abortion, on either side. I'm making a debate to see what the smaller issues are that might be debated best separately.",1,2
1667,"also i suppose sapience could be made a metaphor to puberty. it is impossible to be considered a man before puberty, during puberty you are becoming a man or rather more accurately you are some mixture of man and boy, and after it you are a man which all men can admittedly act boyishly and in some moments not measure up to the standards of maturity which may be imposed on us by the expectation of our mates [we don't grow up, our toys just get bigger! :) ]. Like wise it could be postulated that it is impossible to be considered a person before your conception, that you are becoming a person well in the womb or rather you are some mixture of a person and non person and that after birth you will have moments in which you fail to meet the criteria of personhood. so what does this entail?",1,2

1675,"“It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living?”  Anyone who bluntly says an unborn child is a living thing is missing the concept. People need a wider understanding of this topic as it is of huge philosophical importance. Does an unborn baby have self-awareness/sapience/soul/spirit/ intellect/free-thought?    If not, abortion is no crime  “I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions, that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash.”  Quite a harsh statement. Seeing as the main people who need abortions are teen mothers. These people are far-worse off than any person not capable of mothering children. I am guessing your auntie is aged 30-40, middle-class. These teens are pregnant; they get ostracized, have to fight for economic dependence and may soon be forced to limit the growth of their education to take care of a child. This will ultimately lead to very poor living standards for both of them in the future. If she doesn’t get an abortion, two lives are ruined and we have another generation of dysfunctional youths consisting of crack fiends, prostitutes, pimps, gang members and robbers. Low level income will force them to poor strata’s of society.   Don’t give me some inspirational story about how some mum got out of a life of hardship and she and her son are doing fine. That’s not reality for the vast majority. I grew up in a shitty neighborhood and I would like to see the last of these dysfunctional youths off the street, back in school and focusing on their career.

1676,"When does life start? That is the question. This debate will be over in a matter of minutes if someone came up with the answer right now.  Evangelists would believe it starts at contraception while scientists debate that it is more accurately the development of the brain which is the seventh week of development.   Of course any right minded person wouldn't put the science of birth in the hands of someone with no scientific expertise so it is generally accepted that the 7th is the week that a clump of cells turn into human.  However how can any scientist or evangelist understand when a child gains a soul as the question is purely philosophical?  The soul has been deemed integral or essential to consciousness, personality and every free thinking person has a soul which defines his existence as a human being rather than an imamate object.   Plato says that a soul is a combination of various aspects. Mind, reason, emotion, appetite and desire. These characteristics define a soul. According to Platoan philosophy, if you were void of one of these aspects you are without soul.  -An unborn child has a mind which allows it to make functional processes in its body but is not capable of and thought. Thought encompasses things such as imagination, ideas and reflection. A lot of people say dreams are proof of an unborn child’s thought but dreams don’t count because they are instinctive of a human slumber. It forces the brain to stay asleep as an inactive brain causes your brain to disable processing information from nervous system and other systems. This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up, it’s like a screensaver.   -An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity. (For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion)  -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive, I suppose it counts.  -Unborn children have no desire. They do not want anything but their instinct to, live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then. There is no aspiration or defining motive.   If anyone has any counters against these points I would like to hear what you have to say.

When an unborn child gains all these aspects it moves from inanimate object to living, breathing, free-thinking human being.   Ty.",1,1

1678,"""""Life"" please specify what you mean by the word ""life"".   Sorry what I was referring to was sapience  ""Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.""  What I am trying to get across is that soul is a concept. It’s symbolic of sapience. The concept of soul is key to the philosophical and religious debate about unborn children.   ""Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.""  I was not talking about free will; I am talking about free thought. Free will is the decision to create your own perspective. Free thought defines ones ability to influence its own mindset, create decisions that are not based on instinctual behaviour.   That argument just goes out the window because I did not once mention free-will which is a different concept. The exact phrase I used was “free thinking”.   I feel as if you’re dancing around the concept a bit. I said an unborn baby can’t make any decisions at all, it is completely imamate. Just like a rock, a twig, a leaf, they make no decisions and are only influenced by nature. Yet you’re carrying on about our own free-will.  Yes free-will in the form we know it is an illusion. Our world is only moving in one direction and there is hardly any relativity. However you defeat yourself by saying that statement at all, you deny your own spiritual existence. If you had no free will you would not have wrote that sentence in the first place.   Free-will has no black and white definition. Because if free-will existed I would to be able to do whatever I wanted when I wanted with no consequences but I am restricted to living the life I was giving because of the circumstances of this world. However what you must understand is that free-will is the foundation of our sapience. Without it we are inanimate beings. A mere shell with no occupant.   Most people against abortion are religious fanatics which is why this kind of discussion is appropriate. But you clearly are not. What are you? Are you pro-choice or pro-life or what. It feels like you are dancing between the two.  You made a discussion about sapience and then made a double standard about me not having proof of the existence of a soul?

So I do agree on what you say, ""society be responsible for a females irresponsibility"".  But when it happens, you cant look retrospectivly, you have to look forward. As a teen mother, you cant be given advice such as, ""you should have been more carefull"", when its already happend. So family planning and all that crap can go out the window.  As for financial planning goes, 16-24 years of age for a young woman is the prime age for develpment in educational areas which will one day solidify that persons job stability and stable income. I dont think that their first option should be to suddenly drop everything and take up the cash register at burger king, thats a sure-fire way to ruin two peoples lives! A woman should asspire to greater things in life rather than paying the rest of her life for a mistake which chould have been fixed with one easy pill, injection, baby-killing device or whatever.   I would not liek to see our kind of society (sex crazed maniacs) without abortion. Young teenagers lives in ruins and the detromental affects it will have to the next generation of disfunctional youths. You have to realize what a young child growing up in a fatherless household is like. His/her mother working 12 hour shifts at a fast food outlet just to keep the shanty roof over their heads.

A society raised by bikini models and skimpy clothing isn't a factor of a non-sex crazed society. It’s getting more and more as sexual repression becomes less and less.   Think about it this way, guys think about sex every 3 seconds, that a fact! Girls go out wearing barely anything for sexual is now days.   ""A teen mother is dependent on her own mother. She is in no economic situation to even raise her. She is burdening her network of support, but given proper support can indeed get an education and a wonderful life.

Teen mums, who are left with a baby to take care of and rely on their mums for support, don’t always have a reliable income themselves. We can’t assume every household is economically stable enough fit to take another child into their family.    ""Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.”  Yes I grew up in one of these neighborhoods and it looks like your friends were lucky. However we have to look at the community as a whole not a small sample. The social problems with teens start can start with the fatherless household, or the mum always working or the poor living standards. Worst of all these affects are only exacerbated by the poor kind of environment the child will grow up in. There will be crime, alcohol abuse and many others. It may not have affected your friends but you have to realize this is where teen disfunctionality starts and fuels the next generation of crime, prostitution, drug pushers and gang members. I always tend to look at the worst case scenarios rather than the best.  I am happy for you friend for breaking that cycle, however again we cant rely on people to eventually just straighten their lives out, you must realize how lucky your friends are. Not everyone will have the same support they did.  If we want to help the community we have to give them all the education they deserve.

1682,"Yes, stop the problem at the root. Un-born children have no rights because at this stage they have no self-awareness in the slightest. No spiritual existence. Remember, if it has no sapience we can't classify it as a regular, normal human being so it cannot qualify for the default human rights.   If 90% of abortions are made before brain tissue is even created, no need to worry about the ethics of it at all. This stage is merely miniscule life-forms.

""So are you making an argument that it is better to not live then live a certain kind of life?""  I am saying that a fetus which is alive by definition will die by choice of another human being and be morally sound all the same because it has no sapience attached to it.   So the whole, 'never having a chance to live' is not a feasible argument simply because we don’t talk in future predicted scenarios. We talk about right-here, right-now. Never what could have been.",1,2
1683,"Lets make this quick.   ""Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive""  Worlds most spurious argument? You have absolutely zero evidence to support that statement. You can’t honestly believe a bunch of diagrams on penises and how babies are made can incite sexual fantasies! Teens are naturally sexual, it’s called puberty which answers my next point.  ""At the age of 11 at that""  You hadn't even hit puberty so no wonder you weren’t thinking about sex. I’m just glad sex-ed kicked in before the hormones. Think about this, do you think it benefits society to keep kids totally in the dark about sex till there an adult or to educate them about the right and wrong way to have sex.  ""We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. ""  Yes what the teachers are told you are purely opinion based and I believe should be left for the parents.  ""Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity.""  That’s foolish, again no evidence for this proclamation. Promiscuity is a much sensationalized word and it always used in a bad light. However it is just a word to describe a human’s need for sexual gratification. What they are saying totally makes sense, if you love someone and sleep with them, you aren’t as likely to go out and cheat on them.  Promiscuous: characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association, esp. having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.   If your teachers say you should love the person you’re sleeping with then they are discouraging promiscuity...........  ""People should learn from their mistakes.""  Mate I totally agree with you on that one but what I was saying before was that society won’t help our teen parents with that kind of attitude. They should be supporting them instead.   ""Doesn’t actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job""  Obviously you can’t deter someone from a crime they have already committed... It is clear that a teenager finding out she is pregnant is the most devastating news; it is life changing. I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.",1,1
1684,"That statistic is purely falsified and slanted to fit your point. Yes sex has been on the rise and you blame sex ed? Sex ed was a response to the teen sex rising! You fail to introduce the hundreds of factors that have increase teen sexual behavior.  Allow me to demonstrate a few:  -Increased alcohol abuse   -Christian faith declines, abstinence declines  -Woman gain more rights  -Television idealizes sex  -Society evolves to accept the sex taboo  -Increased drug abuse  -Corporations exploit sexual images  Just to name a few. And you blame SEXUAL EDUCATION?!  The very concept enforced to reduce the outbreak of HIV, teen pregnancy and COUNTLESS STI's and STD's?????  ""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  People I know had sex when they were 13, if they had it any later it would have been too late. Guess what? They used a condom! Now I can guarantee you, the neighborhood I grew up in, they would have had sex at such a young age nonetheless of sexual education. But this example proves that sexual education benefited people in the community. This is the entire point of sex-ed, to educate.  ""You're wrong. They do it again all the time.""  Gratz, you have nothing to prove that statement.   ""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays"" ""...that's not including rape).""   There have been 13 cases of ten-year-olds and under giving birth. All of them were rape victims....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_youngest_birth_mothers    ""attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them... In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'""  Again, I said this before; emotions and sex are purely left for parents. This statement proves no thesis of yours. Sex is not based on emotions on any scale. It is purely hormone based. When you’re in love you still need your hormones for libido. You think animals need love when they have sex? If it is purely natural, you can’t defy the laws of nature.   So tell me, when it is ok to have sex??  ""Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex.""  Firstly, my explanation will serve you better knowing how old you are. I can only assume your maybe under 16 because you have a very repressed view on sex.   So if you’re just a teenager (presumptuously), you would feel perfectly comfortable knowing nothing about sex? It would feel right to understand nothing about what is happening to your body? Then you think about a girl in a naughty way then - oops, what was that? You try and hide your dirty thoughts, thinking that your mind is impure. You carry on this way for the rest of your life. These symptoms have a diagnosis. It’s known as sexual repression. Let me tell you, it is far from uncommon and is a horrible affliction to ones life.   Can I tell you about a group of people who suffered from sexual repression? They grew up with celibacy as their answer. They only thought pure thoughts and repressed all urges. As a result, confused as they were, this group sodomized and indecently assaulted 100 thousand + underage children. These were the priests, the bishops and the pastors. This has been going on long before sexual freedom.   “But at least if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.”  Maybe ‘you’ (the mystical and know-everything teacher) can explain to these kids as to why sex before that age is ‘wrong’ when it clearly is not and especially when it is exercised under the influence of sexual-education and with the help of condoms.   Perhaps you would like to argue why condoms are ‘wrong’ to solidify your statement ;)",1,1
1685,"If you were not taught how to put a condom on, in any years of high schooling, then one of your teachers are applicable to be the victim of a law-suit. If you performed sexual activity with your spouse and got her pregnant, you could make allot of money from one of teachers.   Learning how to put a condom is the entire essence of reducing teen pregnancy and STD's. If safe-sex is performed by teenagers, then it is a non-contributing factor to pregnancy.    "" But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex; they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.""   Well... yes, it does help. You make the basis of this argument with the fact that teenagers are still engrossed in having sex, but what you fail to realize is that education has taught them how to enact safe-sexual procedures decreasing there chance of becoming pregnant. No one argues about teen sexual activity as it is irrelevant if they are doing under the influence of protection.    ""they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate.""   How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate. Especially when this is all under the influence of safe-sex, you have no basis to say that sex is wrong outside these variables of yours.    ""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""   Funny that, it sounds as if you read all of it and didn't have anything easy to rebut so you ignored it in your next dispute. Also if you read it properly without such a bias opinion you would be less inclined to be falsely prophesizing your point of view in a spurious fashion. Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that""  -""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  -""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays” ROFL WTF?!  And now,  -""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""",1,1
1686,"""It is not what is physically there in the womb which is at issue. Rather, it is the fact that this living thing inside the mother has input within it the POTENTIAL to grow""   You forget that denying its life is not a precursor for murder. The whole concept is weather its ethical to deny someones potential to exist before that unborn being has a choice of its own.   However the belief resides in the fact that if that unborn being never comes into existence in the first place, it cant make a choice nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and inamite being as rights are exclusivly to the living, not the living of the future.   "" It is this instinct to develop, this fight to survive, to perpetuate itself which is beautiful and precious""   That is emotional and poetic reasoning",1,1

1688,"Ok firstly, I can find about 50 things wrong with your essay. You have spurious reasoning, invalid statistics, and a clearly bias and ethno-centric view. However I have arthritis and the clock is ticking for me to tell you as much as I can as to why this essay, is poorly executed, and appallingly deceptive.   ""When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked.""""   This statement is full of a personal opinion and doesn’t contain one bit of evidence that proves your point. When she says “baby” she uses it as a euphemism. However it doesn’t matter how she uses, this statement is completely irrelevant to the argument of an un-born child’s self-awareness. Self awareness is what defines a human spirit (or soul if it helps). Hence this is a totally stupefied argument that does not prove your thesis. If you don’t know how or what self-awareness has to do with the topic of abortion, you shouldn’t even be allowed to make a post at all.    ”Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”   You again back up your statements, not with relevant statistics and data, but with personalized opinion. The question of the debate was Abortion; for or against. With this, you should build an argument based on valid points, not perspective.    ” have a real human being waiting to enter the world”    It weird how you make use of the word “real” as a twig is “real”; a rock is “real”; even dirt. Everything in the physical universe is “real”. So of course an unborn baby is “real”, what does that prove?    ” Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”    Again, your purely prejudice statement is not backed up by any kind of fact. This is what debating is, you give fact in exchange for credibility. Also when you use a statement that implies taking life is wrong, you lay completely oblivious to the fact that as an omnivore you are involved in the deaths of hundreds of animals, hundreds of plant material and every time you wash your hands you are killing germs! You have to be clear how you direct these statements because they are meaningless in this kind of topic.    ” Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds.”   They use arguments to justify there opinion, which is exactly what you are doing now. They never bluntly say an unborn child is not a sapient being without having reason to believe so. If they do say so, then ask them why and they will give you an erudite answer.   Again you use the phrase, “wrong acts in their own minds”, partly reflecting an un-backed opinion and a naïve statement reflecting your mis-interpretation the pro-choice cause.   “Women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.”   This quote only proves you have little and a very subtracted view of why a woman would have abortion. “Inconvenient”, in the way you are implying suggests that all woman, despite rape, teen pregnancy, financial instability and risk of life to mother are inadequate reasons to have an abortion. In fact you put them in a light that makes them look greedy and unwilling. When you use the word “callous”, you unreasonably sensationalize your argument implying you have reason to change people’s opinion for personal gain rather than stating relevant statistics and articulately explaining as to why your view is more feasible.    ” abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.”   This statement implies that you have no understanding of what birth control is as the word explains it itself. It is to regulate the chance of contraception. Abortion is used after contraception and isn’t used to prevent it.   ” 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.”   Abstinence being taught in schools is the reason why children are deprived of sexual education. Sex-ed, was implemented to combat the failure of abstinence teachings as unplanned pregnancy skyrocketed from the 1950 to this day and is still going up.    “If abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place”   I have a suggestion, why don’t you conduct a study proving your thesis? You’re saying that abortion availability determines the amount of unplanned pregnancies? Firstly, ruling out abortion all together won’t stop abortion it will just be conducted in an illegal fashion and will be incredibly unsafe.  “Every year, about 19-20 million are done by individuals without the requisite skills… 68,000 woman die as a result…Many woman travel to third world countries where abortions are legal”  - World Health Organization.    ” What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? ... Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion?  ”  This is the kind of backwards-thinking you’re suggesting we make. We cut back on vital scientific research with the intention of leaving us in the dark about our children’s future complications. With no in depth analysis as to why abortion is wrong on a philosophical and scientific scale, you have no structure to base your ‘banning of genetic research’ on.    “Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.”   If your making assonance to anti-stem cell research, you obviously have no clue about prosthetic stem-cells that are not derived from a fetus. If not then I apologize as this sentence was totally random and had a hardly visible connection to your argument. Also who cares if babies, sapient or not become science experiments. Babies are tested all the time. Firstly they are tested for blood levels and all that sought. They are analyzed for the sake of statistics and data. They won’t be dissected if that’s what you’re suggesting. An unborn baby, assumedly an aborted fetus, is ripe for scientific discovery on the other hand. Again with no analysis as to why abortion is wrong, you have no right to say why experimenting on an aborted fetus is wrong.    “Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child.”   If an unborn being never comes into existence in the first place, it cant make a choices nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and imamate being as rights are exclusively to the human beings, not the fetus’.    ” The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”   What makes you think that when he said “we”, he was referring to humans and fetuses? A fetus is a tangible object with potential for sapience but with no current consciousness. So how can it be that an object without any mind of its own be able to possess rights that overcome it in depth?    ” By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen.”   By that logic it means if I was choosing to become an American citizen in the near future, I am already entitled to American rights. I live in Australia and I am now able to possess guns, not use the metric system and pay tax to America rather than Australia. How can that possibly make sense to you?   “Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath.”   Just so you know the term Hippocratic Oath wasn’t named that way because it was hypocrisy, it was because it was named after the Greek Philosopher Hippocrates.    ” Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"".”   Almost all schools in America have abandoned that oath since 1970. It’s meaningless.   ” It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed.”    An abortion is a patient’s choice, not a doctor’s choice…   ” Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism.”   Again living organism is a wrong word to use. As I said before, living organism encompasses all life forms including bacteria, animals and plant life. Yes it is harming it but not harming a sapient, free-thinking being.   I hope you have the audacity to read and digest this information. I suggest you should read the rest of my material on this debate as you will soon find out that abortion is not a black and white topic but it truly relative. I hope you will also see that you have to use relevant data to back up your information rather than basing it on solid opinions.",1,1
1689,"Pros of Abortion   Many a times, abortion helps to safeguard women's health. There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth. But abortion should be carried out after proper medical advice as it can lead to potential miscarriages in the future.",1,1
1690,"Pro-Choice   Nearly all abortions take place in the first trimester, when a fetus cannot exist independent of the mother. As it is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord, its health is dependent on her health, and cannot be regarded as a separate entity as it cannot exist outside her womb.",1,1
1691,"The concept of personhood is different from the concept of human life. Human life occurs at conception, but fertilized eggs used for in vitro fertilization are also human lives and those not implanted are routinely thrown away. Is this murder, and if not, then how is abortion murder?",1,1

1693,Abortion is a safe medical procedure. The vast majority of women - 88% - who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. Medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth.,1,1

That whole issue is inconsequential.  3. Science is silent on the issue of morality. However science does agree that the fetus has an individual genetic code and fits into the biological definition of life. It is an individual human by all biological standards. It is in no way a part of the mother, it just depends on the mother for survival (and so are children outside the womb). Because of this it is deserving of all human rights everyone else has. Unless you can show it is not an individual human or it is not alive, anything else is superfluous.  4. You're just stating the positive side of the coin whereas I said the negative.  5. You're refusing to answer the basic data over and over. Please share how a human fetus is not alive or how it is not an individual with a unique genetic code.",1,2
1706,"1. At this point in the baby's life, it does. The fetus is an individual human. A fetus is just a term for a body in the womb of a mother.  2. It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother. It is alive and an individual. Again there are people born who are never self-aware, some who never feel, so on your view are they not people? The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival, but so is a newborn, so is an infant, and so is a child. These are all different stages of development of an individual human being. It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life.  3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans. I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings; it gets us nowhere. Let's stick with medical facts.  4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you. In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism, akin to poisoning you to death. Not your nails or hair, but your entire self. If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded, comatose, and senile elderly. Moss and insects are a red herring.  You're getting too emotional with the argument. I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you. The fetus is a separate human life and deserves protection if any human deserves protection.  Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes?

It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   It is none of your business what another does with their body.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   Only religious superstition.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.

Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.

Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.  4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.  5. But neither is it the fault of the child.

Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.  The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother.  Therefore, given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development. As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being.  If this is true no other arguments matter. Size, stage of growth (children are less developed than adults, are they less than human?), and location do not matter at all. If it is an individual human being, it has all the rights and protections of all other human beings. Killing this life is tantamount to murder.",1,2

1712,"1. This is not always the case. There are some forms of retardation in which they never achieve these. I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description. People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society. Now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance. If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?  2. ""Reproduction"" in the sense of simple life just means the ability to replicate oneself in some manner. It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to. Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.  Clarification: I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases. At that point I think the doctor needs to make the call and save either the mother or the baby. The moral landscape is such at that point that it's permissible to take action one way or the other because the doctor is sworn to do everything he can to keep his patient alive.",1,2
1713,"1. Newborns are not independent of their natural host. Left alone they will die of thirst. Just as people who are comatose can again become independent with time, a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult.  2. Again there are people with brain damage who will never be able to do these things, given any amount of time. However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults). You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.  3. A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.  4. If this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.  5. I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed. I don't think this in any way excludes her from being a human. A child cannot sexually reproduce because their organs have not come to maturity yet. A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it). Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?  6.1 - Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.  6.2 - Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?  6.3 - Nay. Again this is unfortunate, but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not? If this were acceptable, the retarded, disfigured, and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning.  6.4 - Nothing, read my response to this:  http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Would_You_Kill_1_person_to_Save_the_ lives_of_2_others_assuming_everything_i s_equal#arg224482",1,2
1714,"Sorry I'm not used to the formatting here. Thanks for the tip.   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.   Not at all. The baby still cannot feed itself. Left alone it will die, unlike even an older child who could forage for food. Newborns and young children have no such ability.   Well, so will anything. I don't see what relevance this poses.   Not true. Older children and adults can survive on their own. They can gather their own food and water and find or make shelter.   Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus.   You are, in the same way I'm a 22 year old child. These are just names we give to certain stages of our growth. The point is that while we have different titles for different stages of life, all of those titles are still titles of humans. The difference between a child and an adult is stage of development, as is the difference between a fetus and adult.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.   It fits the biological definition of life and has an individual human genetic code. It is biologically classified as an individual human being.   A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.   Neither can a child nor someone who is asexual by defect. Are they not fully human on your view?   But she can't reproduce asexually, right?   Her cells reproduce like everyone else's. She cannot, however make another human life through sexual reproduction. Think of it this way: She's a human female who has a hormone abnormality such that she has no womb or vagina. She is incapable of ever having a child because she lacks these necessary reproductive parts.   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just ""working on it.""   Your analogy doesn't represent what's going on. Let's move from redesigning a kitchen to building a house. The same scenario happens, and you come in asking what he's done with the kitchen. He says he's done nothing with the kitchen yet, however he's laid the foundation and started constructing the walls. It would be silly to expect a fetus to make reproductive organs before other things like a heart, skin, etc.   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.   See first point.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her.   You're right. However that in no way gives her the right to harm the baby. That's like stealing someone's wallet because someone else stole yours - it makes no sense.   The right to choose what she does with her body.   But she's not killing her own organ. She's not getting an ear pierced or anything. She's choosing what to do with the baby's body, not hers. She's killing the individual life inside her, not one of her own organs or tissues.   The right to choose.   To choose what, though? To end the life of another who has not wronged anyone? Isn't that the very definition of murder? I agree the mother should be able to do whatever she wants with her own body, but the baby is not a part of her - it's just geographically located in her for the time being.   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.   Thank you.",1,2
1715,"I value them equally. I think they are all individual human beings, deserving of any rights and protections any other human beings get.",1,2
1716,"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.  2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.  3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.  4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.  5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?",1,2
1717,"1. The comparison is a bad one. Neither moss nor lady bugs have human DNA. A human fetus has a distinct human DNA code from its mother. The complexity of an organism during development does not affect what it is; a child is less complex than an adult, but both are human.  2. From the same place they performed life-or-death abortions before: the hospital or doctor's office. Abortion has always been legal in life-or-death cases.  3. Look over at my post on the other side of the debate and refute those points, please. It's not well-established that it's not murder. Truth is not relative to our current laws.  4. Laws are put in place with punishments attached to keep people from doing those acts. Laws will never stop those who flaunt them, only punish those who are caught. That should not stop laws from being in place.  5. Again refer to my points.",1,2
1718,"I believe early abortions are ethically sound because all you have at that point is a clump of cells -- not a human being. Destroying a clump of cells is not murder.  I believe late abortions are wrong because at that point you have an almost fully developed human capable of thought and feeling. Killing a developed fetus is murder.  So we are forced to draw a line somewhere and say, ""After this point, abortion is illegal."" I believe Roe v. Wade did a reasonable job of drawing this line -- after six to seven months abortion is illegal.",1,1
1719,"Potential life doesn't matter. Why should it? If you could somehow turn every speck of dust into a human being, then every speck of dust could be considered potential life. Would it then be morally wrong to destroy a speck of dust? No, of course not, because potential life doesn't carry moral weight, only actual life.  The mother has a choice because: 1) Pregnancy is a pain in the ass 2) Childbirth is dangerous and 3) If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.",1,1
1720,"A one month old embryo is only alive in the strict biological sense, the same way a plant is alive. Why is ok to destroy a plant but not an embryo? Neither one of them can think. Neither one can feel pain.  It's only wrong to kill a developed human being.",1,1
1721,"I'm asking you why it's wrong to destroy potential life.  You're saying it's wrong to destroy potential life because it will become life.  In other words, it's wrong to destroy potential life because it's potential life.  This is circular reasoning.  Embryos don't have a say in the matter because they are not yet humans. If I had been aborted as an embryo I would not have given one rat's ass, because I would have been incapable of doing so. No harm, no foul. The world keeps spinning. What's the big deal?",1,1
1722,"But it sure as hell wouldn't be spinning for you.   So what?  You're avoiding the fundamental question.   Why is it wrong to destroy potential life?   I sit here with an open mind, ready to consider your answer. Or do you not have a logically coherent answer?",1,1

1724,"Not true. There are more unwanted children than families willing to adopt (123,000 more as of 2008). If abortion were illegal, that number would balloon.   http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/ stats_research/afcars/trends.htm",1,1
1725,So pregnancy should serve as a punishment for unsafe sex? That's pretty twisted if you ask me.,1,1
1726,"Engaging in unsafe sex is irresponsible. Therefore a woman who engages in it should be forced to go through pregnancy in order to get a lesson in responsibility.  Hmm, interesting argument.   There were 123,000 children awaiting adoption as of 2008.  (source)  So really, you're advocating putting unwanted children into foster care, where they will be supported by the American taxpayer.  If abortion were illegal, than the number of children in foster homes would balloon. How much additional funding would we need to divert from other programs to support that many kids? What would the living conditions be like for the children under those circumstances?  And I still think you're advocating pregnancy as punishment. Calling it ""a lesson in responsibility"" is just sugar-coating it to make sound better. And I don't think the punishment fits the crime. Nine months of pregnancy can cause a major disruption in a woman's life. I agree that unsafe sex is irresponsible, but people can be taught responsibility in other ways. We should handle this problem the same way we handle other acts of irresponsibility. Give the offender a fine, for example. Force them to attend safe sex classes. Maybe even have a prison sentence for repeat offenders.  Early term abortion can solve the problem of unwanted children without violating any ethical principles. We should not discard a useful tool.",1,1
1727,"I don't think we disagree over the question of when life begins. What we disagree over is whether it's wrong to kill non-intelligent life. I guess you could argue that a fertilized egg is technically human, if you're willing to stretch the definition of the word, but it is certainly not intelligent. You never have given me a good answer for why it's wrong to destroy non-intelligent life.",1,1
1728,"Yes, but  why ? In your post on my ""Why is killing wrong?"" debate, you said killing is wrong because it damages the group and because it causes pain. Neither of those apply when killing non-intelligent life.  As for where we draw the line, for the purposes of this debate, let's draw it at any non-zero intelligence. That is, if there's any intellectual capacity at all, killing the person is wrong. So killing a week-old clump of cells is ok, killing somebody who is completely brain-dead is ok, killing anybody else is not ok.",1,1
1729,"""I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion.""   Oh, come on. How could you possibly say that without bringing religion into the debate?   ""I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting.""   We've been over this. The regret could come from not having a kid when she had the chance. But that's no reason to ban abortion. The regret could come from going against the Christian values she was raised with. But again, that's no reason to ban abortion. There are many women who get abortions and feel no regret whatsoever.   ""With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual.""   Heh. By that logic, women should be required to pump out as many kids as possible.",1,1
