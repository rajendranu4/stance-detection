3,"Marijuana is believed to be a stepping-stone drug that can eventually lead to addiction to heroin, cocaine and other harder drugs.",0,2
4,"Many Americans think that the use of drugs is morally wrong, because religious codes prohibit the use of intoxicating substances. Therefore legalizing marijuana would be like legalizing something considered to be immoral",0,2
5,"Marijuana is no more harmful than tobacco or alcohol, if taken in moderate quantities. Tobacco and alcohol are both legal and widely used in the US, regulated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the abuse of marijuana is harmful, isn't the abuse of tobacco or alcohol equally life threatening? Would you want the government to limit how much alcohol or tobacco you take?",0,1
6,"Marijuana has medical benefits in relation to diseases like cancer, AIDS and glaucoma. It is especially helpful in the treatment of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Hats off to states like California that have initiated the move to legalize the drug, at least for medicinal purposes.",0,1
7,"Crime and violence in the US has increased due to the illegal selling and buying of marijuana. Legalizing it would end the need for indulging in criminal behavior. Also, drug related disputes will come to an end and drug mafias would lose their significance. Police can then concentrate more on serious crimes.",0,1
8,"Marijuana is one of the popular agricultural products in the US. According to an estimate by Californian authorities, annual marijuana sales in the state could be worth 14 billion dollars. And new tax revenues from legalizing marijuana could well exceed 1 billion dollars, just in California. Imagine what the revenue will be if it is legalized in the whole of US!",0,1
9,Some believe that legalizing marijuana may increase crime as people involved in illegal trade of the drug are also involved in other crimes. They consider society is safer with marijuana offenders incarcerated.,0,2

12,"I said as much. Not ""Marijuana doesn't hurt your body AT ALL"". And people do have a choice. They can smoke marijuana or they can refrain from smoking it. It just isn't legal.",0,2
13,"Okay. I see where you are coming from. But by legalize it do you mean like cigarettes? As in people could freely smoke in most restaurants (in the ""smoking section"" which isn't always a separate room)?",0,2
14,"Whether it kills people or not, it still is harmful to your body. Ingesting smoke is not good for you. To say something should be made legal because it is less harmful or because it doesn't KILL someone is ridiculous.",0,2
15,Exactly. But that doesn't mean marijuana should be made legal because the other two are. It still harms your body. I don't believe the other two should be legal either. But that is a different topic.,0,2
16,"To say that it should be made legal because it is less harmful to you than alcohol or tobacco is not logical in any sense. The key term to realize here is HARMFUL. Whether it is more or less harmful than other legal drugs doesn't make a difference. It is illegal because of the negative effects it has on your body. To argue that, ""that isn't fair because alcohol and tobacco"" is stupid to say. My reasoning behind this is that alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because to try to make something illegal that has been legal for so long is nearly impossible. Back when America passed the prohibition laws, they didn't stop anyone from smuggling alcohol into the country. In fact, crime rates went up and eventually they had to re-legalize it.",0,2

21,"Reichpride is right. If you don't like the smell, you could move, you could talk to your neighbor, or you could try something revolutionary. You could IGNORE IT!",0,1
22,"Then by your logic, alcohol and tobacco should also be illegal, right?  Because right now in the U.S., those two substances ARE legal to purchase in ANY AMOUNT, from almost any place.  So the question is, since marijuana IS less harmfull to the mind and body than both alcohol and tobacco, WHY are those who use it recreationally, denied to make that choice?",0,1
23,"Of course. The simple reason is: Alcohol and Tobacco.  How can Marijuana be illegal, if Alcohol (which is much more powerful on the mind and body) and Tobacco (which is much more addictive) can be purchased in any amount, at almost any place?",0,1
24,"Yeah I guess.  As I said there is no point in using up tax money on a ""Drug War"" that will never end.  The only thing that will happen if they legalize it is that it will get more users.  I believe it  could  effect our economy.",0,1
25,"I'm only saying yes because, the US government has wasted enough fighting a pointless ""drug war"".  There will ALWAYS be drugs the US cannot eliminate all drugs from it's boundaries it's impossible.",0,1

28,"The only health danger is the tar, which can be practically eliminated with vaporizers; legalization would open up a larger market for vaporizers, increasing demand, increasing competition and bringing prices down so that the market expands even more. Also as part of the condition for legalization the government can provide tax breaks and such for such companies, to decrease the only serious health risk and to improve the economy.   If the purpose of a law is to give as much freedom to people without allowing those people to neglect or abuse others rights, then what right is being threatened by marijuana usage? So called ""hard drugs"" can lead to many social issues and can actually be directly correlated, and scientifically shown to be part of the cause of right violations. Marijuana has less correlation to such things then the few currently legal drugs. Marijuana is unjustly prohibited.",0,1
29,"Exactly, I was saying her argument was far too simplistic. The same argument could be used to support almost anything.",0,1
30,"So has numerous substances, for example LSD, is the fact or possibility of benefits really a sufficient argument in itself for legalization?    http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/ oct/23/lsd-ecstacy-health-benefits",0,2
31,That was my point .,0,2
32,"Marijuana addicts are to ""food addicts"" as apple pie is to peach pie. with pie being a psychologically addicted person.  Its not the chemical substance people become addicted to.   The majority of the few health concerns with pot are eliminated with vaporizers. .Vaporizers should receive some type of stimulus with cannabis legalization to encourage production of more affordable ones and increased demand for them, this could be payed back by taxation of a larger market, with more producers, distributors, retailers and consumers.",0,1
33,"If we legalized marijuana, it would likely bankrupt the cartels, which are profitable because they are the biggest ""under the table"" distributer. People would have no reason to buy from them when they could grow their own, or buy it cheaply from WalMart. The problem is that people under the influence of marijuana are more likely to commit crimes. If it is legalized, we need to be prepared to dump unlimited capital case appeals and do some executing.",0,1
34,"Common sense does. Have you ever seen people do stupid things while under the influence of marijuana? Things they wouldn't have done otherwise? I have. But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next). Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use? There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal. When people don't have an income, they get desperate, especially when they want more money for their next fix. Desperate people do desperate (and often illegal) things.",0,2
35,The only reason that no one is ever reported dying from it is because it's impossible to overdose on it. There have been plenty of highway deaths associated with marajuanna use.,0,2
36,"So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your ""common sense"" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.   No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Marijuana is not addictive.   ""According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old."" -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.   That is not at all my logic. if it was, I would have said that we should keep marijuana illegal because people get it illegally. Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   Marijuana does not hurt anybody   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.",0,2
37,"No. Neither do I think Marijuana should be illegal. I just think that if/when we make it legal, we need to be prepared for the possible ramifications of it.",0,2
38,"I do not support a ban on Alcohol. Nor Do I support a ban on Marijuana. In fact, I have not spent one single moment of my time here saying that it should remain illegal. All I am saying is that it does alter one's state of mind which can lead to crime just as alcohol can, whether it's addictive or not. We need to be prepared for the ramifications of legalizing Marianna if/when it happens.    If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   That's not the same logic. Ideally, marijuana use would be legal, driving would be legal, and they would never happen at the same time. But suppose it does, and someone mows down a pedestrian at a crosswalk and gets charged with manslaughter. In that case, marijuana use would be a contributor to the crime, but not illegal in itself, much like alcohol is now.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.   I agree. But just like alcohol, people will still use it and drive. Especially if it's made legal. Again, I don't advocate it remaining illegal based on that principal, but we must be ready to deal with more high drivers, because that's probably what will happen.",0,1
39,"Again, common sense. More people would be more likely to use it, and therefore more people would be driving under the influence. There would probably be a lot of other people doing stupid things because of it too, but there's no way to argue either way on this that wouldn't be conjecture since it is a hypothetical situation.",0,1
40,"It seems that all of your arguments apply equally well, if not better, to alcohol. Do you think that alcohol should be illegal?",0,1
41,Comparing marijuana to meth is stupid.,0,1

44,"There are many things that are harmful to the body. Smoking cigarettes is harmful to the body and is still legal. As you stated above alcohol is more harmful than smoking marijuana, but it is still legal.",0,1
45,"Okay then. If we were to make everything illegal because it was harmful to us in any way we would be living with next to nothing. Just off the top of my head fast food, junk food, driving, traveling. All of those are potentially dangerous. We shouldn't hold ourselves back because of it. If we taught people safer ways to smoke it then it wouldn't be as harmful.",0,1

Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat.

Another example: Some people under the influence of marijuana have increased motor control, increased focus, increased efficiency in memory, etc; and some people experience these things WITHOUT experiencing anything bad either.   Inevitable point: If you don't like the health risk of Mary Jane, don't smoke it. But when you jail hundreds, maybe thousands, of people a year for smoking a drug that is harmless in comparison to alcohol and tobacco, then your laws have a serious problem.   Illegal marijuana is as inefficient as Prohibition. The difference is that the punishment is worse, and the drug is far less dangerous.   I would argue that marijuana should be illegal as long as all other drugs are illegal, but then again, marijuana has actually treated people with anorexia and helped other people with loss of appetite. What does alcohol do that helps when you ingest it? Nothing. It helps when you swab it on an open wound, but then again, why ingest such a thing? A thing so rancid it kills bacteria automatically?   The answer is that people just do. Prohibition proved that people always will, no matter what any government tries to do. Instead of jailing people, it should be legal, and taxed, and controlled by the government so that it doesn't somehow contribute to killing people.  Then maybe one day, the government will be able to stop tobacco and alcohol companies from killing people to.",0,1
52,"' Marijuana is not a drug, it's a plant that has side-effects when you set it on fire and sniff the smoke. ' - Katt Williams, Super Pimp.  The point of that quote is that Mary Jane really isn't a drug as we would categorize it. In fact, it's more a food then a drug. A drug is a substance, usually man made at the end of the processing, which is not intended for dietary consumption.  Marijuana gets you high  just  if you smoke it from the plant stage. You don't have to add a bunch of chemicals and shit like with all other 'drugs' suchs as cigarettes and meth.   And with said, marijuana is also not addictive, unlike other drugs.  Marijuana is mentally addicted, yes... but so is  ice cream . Do make ice cream illegal for all the fat people it's created? No.  Mary Jane should be legal. Cigarettes and alcohol should be banned.  Did you know it's impossible to overdose on Cannibis? It is biologically  impossible  to overdose on it. You'd have to smoke or eat so much of it that your stomach would explode or you'd suffocate before it could overdose you.  I think I've said enough.",0,1
53,"Marijuana is  much  less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. Studies have shown that marijuana increases concentration and creativity, probably because it stimulates both sides of the brain. Not to mention, were marijuana legal, it's estimated that the U.S. would save around $11 billion a year (I'm not sure if the money we would save by not arresting otherwise harmless marijuana users factors into this, but it's still quite a bit of money). It would create more job necessity and availability. And I've never heard of using marijuana making anyone aggressive, so they couldn't use that as an excuse for demonizing it. :)",0,1

If made legal, it will become a competitive market just like any other thing. (At least for those who don't grow it). That would mean there would still be [illegal] sellers, as they would be breeding more powerful strains to get more powerful amount of THC levels.   The more powerful it is the more addicting. Substance abuse is a health problem. We already have a huge health-care industry centered around alcohol/drug abuse. You want to add to the list?   The Tobacco Companies wait in anticipation so they can start packaging and selling to more idiots. That's right--I'm talking marijuana. No doubt they pay for studies to try to prove that marijuana is ""harmless"". They see big dollar signs, just like with tobacco.  The FDA would have to get involved to ""put a limit"" on ""acceptable"" drug levels. They would also have to enforce these rules, And just like with alcohol, they have to watch for ""bootleg"" sellers who try to sell dangerous products.

Using the ""medicinal value"" isn't a good excuse because they can isolate the medicinal value of the plant from the mind-altering part.  Being illegal has been somewhat of a deterrant but if we take off the deterrant more people will be stoned more often. (take abortion for example). More of it around equals more children ggetting ahold of it. Is this what you want?  More people getting stoned more often means the chance of them coming to work high. This creates a safety issue for EVERYONE, including the quality of any products that come from that company. Do you want to be driving a car put together by a stoner?  If you own a business would you hire someone who is a daily pot smoker? Your insurance company would dump you quick if that's the case. That's why they implement drug screening at the work place. The insurance companies are behind it.  If you want to smoke pot don't expect to keep your job. Even if it's legal.  They can even take your kids away for it. Divorces can get messy ya know.",0,2

The prisons are full, and possession of marijuana ranks at the low end of the scale for jail time.   Why add another drug to the list of legal ones that can screw you up?

End of story, the only negative to pot is the fact that you are inhaling it, and almost any inhalent does damage. so to wrap things up, any individual whom actually has negative things to say about marijuana are just UNINFORMED so look all this up because it is all correct. & within 5 years gaurenteed, it will be legal.",0,1

Same point as above, and there is no control of it now, it can be grown now. It would definitely be taxed highly if it were legal, people can grow their own vegetables but they still buy them + pay tax. Lots and lots of money would be made off of marijuana, billions.   Using the ""medicinal value"" isn't a good excuse because they can isolate the medicinal value of the plant from the mind-altering part.   Not effectively, it's expensive and it's still not as good.   More people getting stoned more often means the chance of them coming to work high.   I could use the same argument against alcohol, or coffee. Workplaces will put policies into place to stop it, if it becomes an issue.

However, research involving actual users paints a rather different picture.    http://scienceblog.com/10660/ study-finds-no-link-between-marijuana- use-and-lung-cancer/     http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/ story/2012-01-10/ Marijuana-doesnt-harm-lung-function- study-says/52483604/1    There is some controversy regarding the efficacy of these findings. Because marijuana is illegal, it is difficult to find users to participate in these studies, particularly finding heavy long-term users. It has been argued that if it were legalized, it would be much easier to find participants from a wider range of the population, and the information gathered could prove to be more accurate. Still, working with what we've got, it appears that marijuana use not only does not have anywhere near the effect that cigarette smoking does in terms of carcinogenic properties, it even seems to lower rates of certain types of cancer.    Marijuana is also highly addictive.   Not  highly . It is significantly less addicting than tobacco or alcohol, about on the same level as caffeine, but usually with less severe withdrawal symptoms. Pretty much anything that stimulates the reward centers of the brain will have some addictive qualities among a large enough sampling of users. But marijuana is very low on the totem pole compared to many legal and even non-regulated substances.    http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ the-teenage-mind/201012/ is-marijuana-addictive     http://health.ezinemark.com/ the-addictiveness-of-marijuana-or- cannabis-31e84cc7129.html     Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine.    Studies have also shown that most marijuana users drank alcohol before smoking pot. But alcohol is not considered a gateway drug. Why? Lower incidence of illegal drug use. But lets think about this for a second. As long as marijuana is illegal the people who use it can be classified as ""people who are willing to break at least one law."" Among adults, alcohol drinkers aren't classified that way. Some might be willing to, and those who are may end up using illegal drugs. Others will be totally law abiding, and since that is the majority of them, alcohol does not get considered a gateway drug. The only way to fairly compare the two would be to put them on the same legal standing and do studies at that point. Further, people who buy marijuana illegally have a greater exposure to other illegal drugs than those who don't since many dealers deal in multiple drugs. I suspect that the legal status of marijuana plays more of a role in its status as a gateway drug than any actual medical reason.    If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence.    The War On Drugs is at least partially to blame here. First, the strategy behind the WOD is to increase the cost. But since most drugs, marijuana included, are highly elastic commodities, this doesn't much reduce the demand. Instead it makes for wealthier drug lords, and competition between them leads to violence. The harder we crack down, the worse the situation gets. Also, we would make it less profitable for the drug lords by opening a legal channel of distribution and cultivation. Having marijuana as a legitimate source of retail would seriously reduce the number of people obtaining it illegally. It could also be regulated for quality and purity this way, which is currently not possible.",0,1
72,"Yes. In comparison to those substances which we allow (alcohol and tobacco being the two most obvious) it is really no worse. It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept. And arguably the best point: we could stop using taxpayer money to crack down on dealers and instead tax pot sales via liscenced distributors. This is a particularly timely point given our government's deficit.",0,1
73,"I'm against recreational use of those too :) Any drug that is not primarily for medical purposes.  And you can do whatever you want, just as I'm allowed to be against whatever I want.",0,2
74,"Woops. Didn't change the tag. I am for legalization; out of having it illegal and legal, allowing people to smoke it is the less negative option. Pro-legalization, but anti-drug.",0,1
75,"Laws aren't really doing anything to stop cannabis consumption, anyway. If you legalized, you could tax it too. Sure, legalize marijuana. But that's not the problem, is it?  But I am personally against recreational drug use. Why is life so boring that one requires external stimulants? Unless restricted live in a cell forever and the like, it's always possible go something with your life. Society didn't spend all those years on people, raising them, feeding them, just to waste resources.",0,2
76,"Of course. Everyone is entitled to their own preferences, so, why make them illegal?",0,1
77,"I think marijuana should be legalized for various reasons.   First of all, let me make it clear that I currently do not consume marijuana. I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people. Like tobacco, it could be heavily taxed and provide more money for the Federal Reserve (I'm not sure that is a good thing).  So, there's my argument. Anyone beg to differ?",0,1
78,"Yeah, but what about alcohol and tobacco? It's OK for those substances to be legal? Some people like to use recreational drugs because it gives them a different perspective of things. Sure, it's harmful for their bodies but who are we to say what they can and cannot do to themselves? Personally I'd prefer more stoners around than all the murders that occur because of the illegal trafficking.",0,1
79,"They cannot tax marijuana without additives, and this is the ONLY reason it is illegal. Furthermore, our country hands out legal (prescription) heroin, and amphetamines like candy which cause greater health risks and addiction.",0,1
80,So how do you feel about prescription drugs? Those are legal and have way more harmful side effects- marijuana is illegal because it can't be taxed without additives.,0,1
81,"Marijuana is, relatively speaking, an extremely safe drug which also offers numerable benefits, including to those who are suffering from the effects of cancer treatment. The war on drugs has failed to substantially sway people from using the drug, which is now far cheaper than it was thirty-five years ago. Furthermore, what one person wishes to ingest is the business of that one person, and nobody else.  My primary problem with the legalization idea is that, as soon as the government gets their hands on such a bountiful supply of income, they shall go  tax-happy  and skyrocket the price.",0,1
82,"In reality   Or whatever passes for reality in your mind.   Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol   Can you provide any evidence? You see, I can provide a lot to indicate otherwise. Alcohol kills, according to NORML, around 85,000 people a year! Tobacco kills 435,000 people each year! Then we come down to good ol' Mary Jane, and she isn't responsible for a single death.   Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug   Marijuana has been proven to not be a gateway drug.   into crack cocaine, heroin    Nope    opium   WHO THE HELL DOES OPIUM ANY MORE?!?   It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed.    Depends on the user. I've known people who smoked until they greened out, but others only take a toke or two to relax.   When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional.    This is based purely on personal observation, but I'd say that one is more functional when high, but functional in a different manner.   Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed   Yet it still is more damaging to the body than weed!   Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco   Depends on how much you smoke. All day every day, probably; but most people aren't like that.   however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does   You hear about drunk driving all the time, but I've never heard of a case where the only intoxicant involved was ganja.   Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain.   Willing to provide evidence for this?   Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected.   As somebody who actually smokes pot occasionally, I disagree with this.   With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run.   That just sounds plain ridiculous!   Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues   Slow down?! Cheeba saves lives!   it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue.   Depends on the issue, I should imagine. It helps people going through chemo to eat, which is pretty damn useful if you want to, you know, LIVE.   Same goes with prescription medicine.   Compare the negative side effects of, say, just about any prescription medicine with the negative side effects of sensimilla. I dare you.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because politicians, doctors, and those involved with Big Pharma make shitloads of money from their legality.   I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case   Fortunately. Herb should be used because of its benefits to all, not just the sick.   Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults.   As well as many adults. Most people, once again in my experience, do not abuse it. Most people use it recreationally, and it does less harm than good.   There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill.   Too many trillions wasted on finding and incarcerating those non-violent users of drugs?   The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.    Mull use is goin' down!",0,1

98,"What is truly pitiful is that one could find pity and fear in what you do not know. I use your post as supporting evidence.    Now, if you're realistically thinking about this issue, and not in Imagination Land, you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity. I am a citizen of these United States of America, and I know what that means.   I personally have no concern about the drug itself and I am fully aware that cigarettes and alcohol are more dangerous, but legal.   When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine for the few drugs on the market that marijuana could (realistically) replace. Also, I actually advocate the use of hemp and wish America would get with the program, I know the benefits of hemp cloths and hemp oils.   What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.    If you look at society as a whole, we already have a few cancers at work. Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug. Cigarettes, for the economy are bad, because those who smoke are hopelessly addicted and will spend money on cigarettes before spending it on things that they should buy, like food or clothes. Do we really, at this point need another? For people who don't drink, and for people who don't smoke cigarettes?   Like I said, think about it realistically. What is government for? Why is a government needed at all, I mean, what is the main single duty of a government???  It is to secure domestic peace , before anything else, that is what a government does. The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace. If someone steps out of line, because they have agreed to live under this government, are held to the same rules as the next. No one steps out of line, and we have a perfectly paired society to it's government. Unfortunately we, as humans, cannot have this.    So if the government only really exists to secure domestic peace, yet we already have a number of drugs out there, why should we have another to complicate things with.    Also, you have to imagine that weed is legal. No more will people feel the need to be home when stoned. They might as well get stoned in public. Like drinking, especially if it were made illegal, people would take their beer home with them, and drink there, most people  do , stay home and drink. If it were illegal, you wouldn't see drunk people as much now would you? I highly doubt you would.    Marijuana, I logically think, would be more addicting than tobacco and alcohol combined if it were made legal and then integrated into popular culture, as tobacco is. You get more for less, with less consequences... what a dream, right? I mean, if I am opposed to the legalization, yet I would still do it if it were, doesn't that mean something???   It's something that I don't want to deal with, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on this. If it were legalized, it would only get worse.    That's really all I can say for now, and sorry if it wasn't enough to satisfy your lack of understanding.    I would like to advise you that ad hominen arguments are not welcome here.      You are on a website that allows you to share ideas and opinions.

Drugs have different effects on everyone. If I had to guess, I would say yes, they probably would be a tiny bit more creative if they tried certain drugs.

Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk. And much less dangerous than driving while texting. Unlike you I am actually going to cite a study, by the United States Department of Transportation no less:  “This report concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. … This program of research has shown that marijuana, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a consequence, THC’s adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.”  REFERENCE: W. Hindrik and J. Robbe and J. O’Hanlon. 1993. Marijuana and actual driving performance. Washington, DC: US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Report No. DOT HS 808 078.  I am by no means suggested that it should be legal to drive high. I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.  Marijuana legalized =&gt; More people use marijuana =&gt; More people drive high =&gt; There will be many more deaths as a result  Hypothetically speaking even if marijuana was proven to cause as much driving impairment as alcohol, this would still not be grounds for it to be illegal. One of the most dangerous things to do while driving is sleeping. But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.  Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.",0,1
152,"Regarding your first two points, I agree, but your point is irrelevant. Yes people do break the rules, and if they do they will be punished. We have laws against playing music too loud, but because people do it anyway, should we make playing music illegal?  Yes marijuana would be cheaper if legalized, you do not understand the way a black market works. Because the people growing, trafficking, and selling marijuana have to take huge risks, they make the price higher. Once legalized the price would lower. So your argument that there would be a blackmarket with cheaper prices is invalid.  Really the last thing we need as a country is more people doing marijuana? I can think of far worse things. Assuming that legalizing it would significantly increase use long term, which you don't have evidence for, what is the big deal? People do not end up at rehab for marijuana. It is not addictive. If they go to rehab it is because they have addictive personalities and are using it too much because of that, not because it is addicting. People with addictive personalities can need help for anything. Out of curiosity would you have slapped Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they created apple while smoking marijuana.

And the past three presidents have admitted to smoking pot. You can very easily be a very successful habitual smoker, but it is far more difficult to be a fully functional alcoholic.

Furthermore why do you think an increase would cause ""pandemonium"" as you put. I don't think you understand the physical effects of marijuana.

157,"I will argue first from a practical position, then philosophical, then historical.  Marijuana is not dangerous. There has been a death recorded due to marijuana. The LD50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high. Far higher. You can reasonably say it is so high, it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana. Also marijuana does not make you stupid. The reason people think this, is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen. When you die from a lack of oxygen, your brain cells die. The severe errors in the study, however, were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid. They have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke. A UCLA study found no link. The gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana. Because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers, they are exposed to harder, dangerous drugs. If marijuana was able to be sold in stores, this would not happen. Legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children. According to many studies, it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol. This is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for IDs. However, because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot. The legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy. We spend billions of dollars each year to keep people in prison because they like to get high and relax. Additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation. It is the number one cash crop in California for example. ~60% of the money of Mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the US. Severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the United States as well as Mexico, which would help improve Mexico's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the United States.  The government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else. It is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner, but I guarantee that it's much better for both you and society that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner. Here's a more reasonable example: Should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend? This is much more harmful than marijuana, and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death. The bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism. Where do you draw the line? Do we monitor people's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure people are productive and that they get promoted? Do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you? Do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because people have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana? The answer is no. Adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves. We do not live in a ""nanny-state"" as Ron Paul puts it.  Many people assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it. This simply isn't true. The first marijuana laws in the United States forced people to grow marijuana during colonial times. Marijuana became illegal for a few reasons. One was due to extreme anti-Latino and anti-black sentiment. People were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white society especially due to marijuana. The ""reefer madness"" campaign created undue hysteria. Yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role. In fact President Nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal.  http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/ Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm    The next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal. Again there are a few reasons. What kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism. By this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana, that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal, they will most likely cite things that simply aren't true. Additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge. Companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal. They don't want competition. Why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive? Many people underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy. The alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti-drug and anti-marijuana advertisements and programs. The goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs, its to stop you from doing drugs that they don't sell you. Also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the United States. Just like the tobacco and alcohol companies, pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress. Marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health. It combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions, and has no side effects. Compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs. It has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects. Thousands of people die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs.  As I hope you can see, the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels. Making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids, keep people away from dangerous hard drugs, and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives.",0,1
158,"""I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions""   Once again you have nothing but speculation to back that up. This didn't happen with prohibition of alcohol and it didn't happen when Amsterdam legalized marijuana and it didn't happen when Portugal decriminalized all drugs.   ""don't say it's not addicting. I know people that are addicted""   I will say it isn't addictive because it is not physically addictive. I don't care how much anecdotal evidence you have, it has been proven to not be physically addictive. While cigarettes and alcohol are incredibly addictive, yet you seem to be okay with them.   ""Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America.""   You are completely making that proportion up. It is based on absolutely no evidence. You would be just a justified if you literally picked a random number because that is basically what you did.  And what havoc do you think people wreak on America that do it now. Once again as you failed to acknowledge marijuana does not cause reckless and uncontrollable actions like alcohol does. Yet once again I doubt you support the prohibition of alcohol.   ""Productivity would go down""   And again another statement based totally on social stigma and no actual evidence.  I challenge you to cite one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes that you actually have a shred of evidence. I really don't think you can come up with a single one. If you can, prove me wrong. Once again it cannot also apply to alcohol or cigarettes and must be have evidence. Don't speculate or provide anecdotal evidence.",0,1
159,"""But the American public has come to understand the bad that can come of these drugs.""   Annual deaths in the US from tobacco: 435,000  Annual deaths in the US from alcohol: 85,000  Total recorded deaths due to marijuana: 0  I'm not so sure people understand the harm that comes from them.  I don't see how you can support prohibition of marijuana, but not alcohol and tobacco without realizing what a hypocrite you are. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse no matter what metric you use.   ""Just because pot may not be physically addicting, does not mean it is not mentally addicting, which is just as bad. It means your brain is hooked and can't function without it. ""   No you can still function without it, you are thinking about the addiction that comes from cigarettes which you support. Marijuana can be psychologically addictive. All that means is that if you really like the feeling of being high, you will want to do it again. This does not mean you are not able to not do it. Anything that you enjoy can be psychologically addictive (Sex, gambling, createdebate.com). Even if marijuana were addictive like cigarettes and alcohol, you cannot use this point to argue against legalization unless you support prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. As I said name something bad that it doesn't have in common with those two drugs.   ""They tend to forget that marijuana smoke is 6 times worse than cigarette smoke, when it comes to carbon monoxide and the toxicity of the smoke itself.""   You have one misleading and one incorrect fact there. Marijuana smoke has been shown to not cause cancer. Scientists hypothesized that it would cause cancer because it contains more harmful chemicals, but when they did actual studies on live animals, they found absolutely no link between marijuana and any form of cancer. This is just one study by UCLA I can get more if you desire them.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html   So while it may be true that it contains more harmful chemicals, for whatever reason it still doesn't cause cancer.   In reference to the toxicity of the smoke, you couldn't be more wrong. Scientists have not been able to induce death in an animal due to marijuana. It's LD50, or quantity that would be lethal to half the population, is so high, that we cannot even find it. It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana and consequently there has never been a recorded death due to it.   http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm   I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you say smoke causes ""little nicks"" in arteries. Please cite an article or study because what you are saying makes no sense.  The study you cited by the British Lung Foundation doesn't appear to have been published in a peer reviewed medical journal like the studies that show marijuana is not harmful. Here is why the study is misleading.  They start out with a very bold statement  ""Smoking pure cannabis is more harmful to lungs than tobacco, a health charity is warning.""  So you continue on reading to see how exactly they proved that.  First ""evidence"":  ""A study by the British Lung Foundation found that just three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes. ""  First of all it is very uncommon to smoke three joints a day. Secondly they were most likely comparing unfiltered joints and filtered joints which is really intellectually dishonest. They also don't talk about what type of damage they are referring to. Marijuana smoke does temporarily paralyze the cilia or small hairs in your air passageways which can temporarily increase the risk of colds and other upper respiratory tract infections(OH NO). The smoke does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Furthermore there are other ways to ingest marijuana, including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals, vaporizing which releases only the THC and no harmful chemicals, and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals.  Second ""evidence"":  ""Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco. ""  As I said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say. While it may contain more carcinogens, it doesn't cause cancer. Numerous studies have failed to find any link. Yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer. Think about it, if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke, or even bad all, why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer, but so many showing tobacco causes cancer. There is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone.   http://www.salem-news.com/articles/ january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                           As I said, they don't have any concrete evidence that it causes health problems. It is not enough to say it contains dangerous chemicals. Especially when numerous studies show the chemicals don't cause damage.  You still somehow manage to fail to name one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes with evidence. Every thing you named once again is present in alcohol or tobacco and most of them weren't true.  So once again I ask you to name a negative result of marijuana that isn't present in tobacco or alcohol. And don't give me, 'it's too late to make alcohol and tobacco illegal.' First of all it is never too late, that is a cop out. But regardless of the pragmatism of making them illegal, I'll bet you still don't think we should.",0,1
160,"The number of deaths due to marijuana is not low, it is 0. I don't care how impossible you think it is, try and find one death due to marijuana. If it was as dangerous as you seem to think it is surely it should be easy to find one.   ""And pot is addicting. I know people, on a personal level, who are addicted to marijuana. You cannot deny that. ""   Unless you are a doctor you are not qualified to diagnose an addiction in someone. And are you really going to try to use anecdotal evidence to combat scientific claims that it is not physically addictive. Just because someone does something a lot does mean it is addictive, that is a common misconception.  No you didn't come up with a negative factor of marijuana that it does not share with tobacco or alcohol, you came up one they share but said it is worse with marijuana, which it isn't anyway. Come up with something unique to marijuana, do you know what that word means?  It has never been proven that cigarette smoke causes cancer? You are joking right?  You think that inhalation of marijuana smoke can lead to cerebral hypoxia? Unless you inhale almost pure smoke continuous for a few minutes that can't happen. Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal.   How do you think doing a few bong hits leads to complete brain oxygen depletion for any amount of time whatsoever let alone an hour?

An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.",0,1

The team-building activities don't really work out till the they realize some wacko soviet soldiers are waiting in the woods to kill them one by one, only then they manage to form some sort of a group working together, helping each other, the survival of each is dependent on the survival of the team.  I figured that it might be a bit loose, but there is something about getting into drugs that brings back something that was lost during the arms race in the name of nape security. To illustrate - A few years ago I wrote a story about an alien civilization acting as if they were about to exterminate all humans, the aliens announced it on the news so a global panic was achieved, and nothing really happened, only that a feeling of survivalism boiled up everywhere, there was a greater power threatening from above, one intention over everyone, seeing all human kind as unified, ignoring our differences and difficulties with each other.

You also seem to think it will magically develop addictive properties once its legal.  You fail to show why the law should be invasive enough to regulate what you put in your own body, or why the law should be used to legislate away things you don't like. Governments allow industry to put all kinds of toxins and waste into our food, air, and water, and the government gets paid to allow it, and all the citizens are forced to ingest it. No reason we shouldn't all have the right to knowingly poison ourselves.  Also, your argument seems to assume that many people would suddenly begin using marijuana who are not already, and there's no data to prove this. People are already spending their pot budgets, nothing would change there (except maybe they could grow it and save).  Your entire view of government is rather disturbing.

I'd rather see users treated like those in need of medical and psychological attention. There shouldn't be anything on their permanent records, they shouldn't go to jail or prison, and they shouldn't be stigmatized.   Users should be sent through rehabilitative structures and helped to find better ways to spend their time and money. Educating themselves, expanding their minds, getting good jobs, having fun in more productive ways. Users should be helped towards a better, happier life without the need for mind altering chemicals.   Pushers, however, are a different matter. Small-timer pusher and pushers of less dangerous drugs should go through the same services. But people selling deadly, horribly destructive drugs to people are partially responsible for their downward spiral. They should be punished, with jail time and prison time (depending on what they did and how they did it) followed by rehabilitation and job training/higher education.",0,2
195,"The reason I don't like marijuana, alcohol, hard drugs, and certain kinds of prescription medications is rather simple: I don't think people should sacrifice who they are, in some cases their free will or their humanity.   When someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard drug or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control.  Marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth.   We, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. Drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. It is an escape; an escape which noone deserves.   I don't mind people escaping in other ways: video games, reading, television, camping..etc, at least they are still thinking, at least their self is still intact and operating.   When people do drugs they stop being people and start being Mr. or Ms. X+meth, or X+Marijuana, or X+alcohol. It isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run.   Governments and societies are meant to protect us; usually from dangers outside. This danger, this threat is unique in its internal, self-inflicted nature.   Again, Marijuana is only a petty offender in this case; which is why I am not adamant about its status as an illegal narcotic. There are far worse legal drugs which I am much more concerned with.   Does that help in explaining my objection to its use? I am still forming my opinion on this one so I know my logic is abit choppy and in some cases exaggerated.",0,2
196,"People cannot sell themselves into slavery, people cannot give other people permission to murder them, people cannot give up their inalienable constitutional rights to due process...etc..etc. People don't have the right to take away their rights and freedoms; if someone is mutilating their body, attempting suicide, or engaging in obviously harmful activities our laws clearly indicate we have the right to detain and provide psychological treatment to them.   Noone left me in charge, I have an opinion. We are all imposing our beliefs about what is best for ourselves and each other when engaging in democratic activity so I don't see the problem with my objections to and sanctions of narcotics.   The difference between escaping through activity and escaping through chemical alteration is the difference between exercise and steroid injections. It is the difference between increasing your height through a proper diet while still in your development stages and breaking your legs and resetting them repeatedly.   Not only is the activity unnecessary, a cop-out, and usually not even a remedy for a real malady, but it is an extreme approach and ultimately detrimental to the person's body, mind, and their professional life.   What I am saying is that in the case of drugs people are willfully giving up their freedoms; I would like to have it given back. Besides, if they are already giving up their freedom and humanity for a little pleasure, why on earth should they have the rights in the first place? Would you give a teenager a car if they decided to wreck it, on purpose, every time just to experience the thrill?   People shouldn't be allowed to choose to be slaves just as much as people aren't allowed to be slave-owners. I find it frightening that people seem to actively look to be controlled, by addiction or dictators, and I don't want such behavior to go unchecked.   Video games are an absence of the use of freedom, chemical alterations remove them or block them. Chemicals destroy personality and individuality, pass-times merely divert them and slow their growth or actualization.   Again, Marijuana isn't a big deal in this respect; but legalizing it certainly doesn't help. It does dull the senses, it does have long-term psychological and intellectual effects, and it is possibly as if not more carcinogenic than Tobacco and just as addictive (not yet completely substantiated so I could be wrong).  Some basic facts on it can be found here; a rather well-rounded survey of Marijuana and its effects:   http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    From the site:  ""Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.""  ""A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia.""  Now, that, again, is not known to be 100% true. Marijuana research is still in its developing stages (probably due to its illegality) and so not enough is known to say anything with certainty.   I'd like to see more studies to make sure that it is as benign as many people like to think it is. If it turns out to be then I have even less of a problem with it. The hard drugs, however, should always be illegal in my eyes.",0,2
197,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",0,1
198,"I've seen you post on a lot of debates, and as funny as your jokes are (/sarcasm), I have to disagree with your point. Although people may not be able to remember things as well while high, I do not believe there has been any study done to see if there is actually a correlation between marijuana use and memory loss. If I am wrong then please post the study. (Also do you think that a little memory loss warrants prohibition?)",0,1

As for music, I can give you a whole list of artists and songs that were influenced by marijuana. My favorite example would be Bob Marley but there are many others.   I would say that the reason you know more stupid people than smart people that do weed is probably because there are more stupid people in in the world than smart people, but then again I don't know who you hang out with so I can't make a judgment.   If you look at most collages, especially liberal ones, you will find a significant portion of the student body either has tried or regularly uses marijuana. What this says to me is that there are a significant amount of intelligent people who do use the drug.",0,1

201,"i actually wrote a persuasive essay on this not too long ago for my English class and i got a perfect score on it so i thought I'd share it with you all.      The Decision is Ours  Marijuana is a THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) containing plant which is illegal and discriminated against in all but a handful of countries. A number of the common effects of this plant include a euphoric feeling, stress reduction, deep thinking, pain relief, increased appetite, and a few negative effects such as lightheadedness or confusion. It has been argued for years whether the cannabis plant is a drug or simply a natural herb like any other with stronger side effects, many people considering both herb and drug to be the most logical answer. The earliest it is recorded to be utilized, orally and smoked, is 2700 B.C. in China and India, having been outlawed in the United States in the early 1900’s. Uses such as religious purposes, medicines, and relaxation; should marijuana be legalized? My belief is that there would be no harm in this change of law, and the economy would prosper from it.  The First Amendment stated in the United States Constitution Bill of Rights reads:  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  Religious peoples, for example Rastafaris, Shintos, Hinus, Buddhists, Sufis, Zoroastrians, Bantus, and many other sects, have traditions that require ganja as a part of their lifestyles and sacred ceremonies. All of these customs had been established long before the banning of the plant. So when prohibiting marijuana is that not taking away their first amendment right of freedom to exercise their religion?  Before its ban, marijuana was a major active ingredient in 40-50 percent of medicines. Nowadays it could be used to replace at least 10-20 percent of medicines. Marijuana has hundreds of proven uses from treating nausea, pain, multiple sclerosis (MS), glaucoma, and asthma to stress reduction and cancer therapy. If you have glaucoma, the third leading cause of blindness brought about by increased pressure in the eyeball, this herbs effects reduce pressure in the eyeballs and though other medications can be used for treatment they tend to lose efficiency over time. With MS the normal functioning of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord are disrupted, harsh debilitating attacks that come and go along with many uncomfortable symptoms that lead to eventual disability occur, the use of cannabis in this situation treats a number of the symptoms as well as delays the progression of the disease.  In the United States alone every 15 minutes someone is killed in an alcohol related accident, this is approximately 50 percent of all deadly car collisions. Just about half of industrial deaths and injuries can be linked to alcohol consumption. Along with those statistics four in ten criminals and three in four of domestic violence offenders have reported to have alcohol as the reason for their violent behavior. On an annual basis in the US alcohol kills about 80,000 people, as for marijuana - there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana, you are more likely to die from an overdose of asprin. In fact, as far as we know it is impossible to overdose on marijuana and contrary to the common belief it does not influence violence or crimes. Even all of the illegal drugs put together are responsible for a small percentage of deaths compared to tobacco, is it really fair that these more harmful and fatal substances are legal but marijuana is not?  During the rise of the Rastafaris in Jamaica a man named Leonard Howell owned a large amount of land he called Pinnacle. Pinnacle was designed as a place for Leonard and hundreds of his Ras Tafari followers to live separated from the accusing eyes of the public who viewed them as criminals and thought their ideologies to be absurd, most of his followers had been poor peasants but this all changed with the growth of their ganja plantation. They had grown and sold so much marijuana that they built shops and were able to care for themselves with plenty of extra money, the rest of the valley eventually depending on them for necessities such as food and the herb. In California marijuana is already the largest cash crop and the UN has estimated that 2.5 percent of the world’s population smokes cannabis, with cannabis legal and the government regulating it like every other product of America our economy would thrive.  To put it simply, the United States does not outlaw “junk” food and vending machines simply because it is bad for you, although they may be unhealthy it is the individuals choice on whether they want to consume them or not. It is the same with marijuana, though there are few minor health risks, it is the individuals’ responsibility to look at the pros and cons and make the decision they want. Should marijuana be legalized? My answer is yes, whether for religious uses, medical reasons, just recreational purposes, or merely because the government should not have the right to dictate the lives of their citizens if it is not harming society, the legalization of marijuana would produce no destruction to our social order and the economy would expand.  There are other reasons I think marijuana should be legalized, these are just the main ones. Hope you all enjoyed it =)",0,1
202,"weed should be legal.  it's the safest ""drug"" there is and it's ridiculous that alcohol and cigarettes are legal and killing people while marijuana is illegal and hasn't killed anyone.  plus it doesn't have any serious side effects, just makes you more relaxed and sometimes you think about things that never cross your mind while sober. i think the government has no right to dictate the way we live our life and what we do in our spare time as long as we're not hurting others or vandalizing property.  there's many other reasons why i think it should be legal, this is just a few of them.",0,1
203,"That point of view is very scary. You think the government should be able to control your personal life even when your minding your own business and hurting no one. And yet also allow big corporations to push substances more deadly than marijuana on consumers (Alcohol, Tobacco, Prescription Drugs).   Legalization is about the fact that a person should have the right to privacy and the choice to live their lives how they see fit as long as they hurt no one else. Consider the fact that prescription drugs have become the number one killer in these recent years. People are going to get high off what is available; why restrict them to things that are more dangerous. And why criminalize people who choose to use natural herbs instead of stuff created in laboratories.  Last I checked America was a country of liberty and freedom; but I guess that doesn't mean the same thing in this last century. The founding fathers didn't want to have some central government dictating the citizen's daily lives. It is supposed to be a government by the people and for the people. And most importantly under the law of the constitution. People don't want anything they don't deserve; they only want the one thing supposedly guaranteed in this country; Freedom.

204,"""That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this.""   I completely disagree with this statement and it goes against any scientific proof. Studies have been done that prove if you take breaks and have more leisure time you are a much more effective worker. Now obviously if you are neglecting your responsibilities leisure is bad. But that in no way implies that you have to be always working.  In your next response you talk about how you morally think doing things that are unproductive or enjoyable are wrong. I have several problems with this. First off, honestly I'm not you and neither is anyone else why should we have to be held accountable to your unreasonable and arbitrary morals. Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy people are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect people to operate without leisure time.  If you are going to tell people whether they can or cannot use substances such as Cannabis; than at least have a better reason than your supposed morals that almost half the country disagrees with. You admit to being hypocritical about your no-leisure rule by being on the internet rather than doing something productive and who is to say that is all your hypocritical about. So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals.  But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through illegal channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a legal substance (Alcohol) in my spare time.

205,"First off in the initial few paragraphs I am talking about any leisure in general and not just cannabis, remember you said people are morally/ethically wrong if they stop working, and especially if they enjoy something. You also seem to think I am saying it would be okay to do leisurely activities while on the job which I didn't. However if your responsibilities are finished it is better you enjoy yourself than be a robot who thinks its wrong to enjoy things be it cannabis, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. Either way, ethics or morals it doesn't matter I still don't see why someone else ought to live by your personal ethics/morals.   And your correct that leisure does not require marijuana however some people enjoy using marijuana in their leisure time. And unless we want to set up a draconian system to make all pleasures wrong (which you would probably support) it is hypocritical to allow some substances and not others, especially if those other substances are less harmful.  You still have not given a reason to keep drugs illegal. It is an inconsistent argument and if we want to start taking away one persons right to what they enjoy in their spare time when will it stop? I may not know what you personally enjoy but I should not have the right to deprive you of your enjoyment if your not harming anyone else.  As far as a study that proves happier workers are more productive here is one of the first articles that came up with google, mind you I didn't search for long...   http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/ workinglife/article990727.ece    The use of marijuana hurts no one but the individual who choses to use it. Why should it be anyone else's choice whether they hurt themselves or not. And if they do abuse marijuana to the point of harming themselves how is it the substances fault? Should we criminalize knives because I could possibly slit my own wrists? I really don't believe your completely consistent with your line of thinking. But you could be. My question is who gets to determine these arbitrary rules? Because that is all drug criminalization is, for the most part just a random arbitrary law for no reason other than control.",0,1

The people I'm talking about cutting off from the dealer are the ones who just want to relax on pot for a while, and have no real intention of ever turning to anything heavier. The ones who it takes a lot to get them to try anything new. The ones who after months and months of ""Just try it, on the house, no worries,"" finally give in thinking ""Just once."" That's how my ex started on speed. For years he had smoked pot, saying that doing anything else was a fool's game. But all his ""mates"" (i.e. his dealer and the guys he hung out with while he was at his dealer's house) were doing it, and they were all egging him on. So the first time, he tried it at a quarter dose. But he refused to inject it. He was adamant about that. He dropped balls... meaning he swallowed small amounts of speed wrapped up in cigarette papers. For about a year he tried it off and on, which was enough time for him to get well and truly hooked on it. At which point he started injecting it. I left him soon after. He's gone on to do pretty much everything since, and last I heard he was on the methadone program.  If pot had been available over the counter, I doubt that his habit would have escalated beyond pot. He would simply have been too lazy to go and find someone to sell him something illegal.",0,1

He didn't start using pot because he wanted to be high. He started using it to fit in with a crowd of people. He was very susceptible to peer pressure. That's the reason he went on to other drugs. He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be ""friends"" with his dealer. So yes, it was his fault, because if he hadn't been such a weak assed spineless wimp of a man he would have stuck by his guns.

Of those charged with cannabis violations, approximately 89 percent, 775,137 Americans were charged with possession only. An American is now arrested for violating cannabis laws every 38 seconds.

Cost:  ""Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 43,266 inmates per year. About 25 per cent are sentenced for drug law violations. "" -Many of these people's lives were completely ruined by incarceration.  ""The U.S. federal government spent over $19 billion dollars in 2003 on the War on Drugs, at a rate of about $600 per second. The budget has since been increased by over a billion dollars.

My feeling on this is that if marijuana actually is dangerous....then not only would we know it from hearing about it, but these studies would have conclusive, definitive results. Not wishy-washy, half-assed results. Also: you won't find anything in that report that is worse than existing legal substances and pharmacueticals (think vicoden, lithium, valuum, morphein, wel butron, etc.).  So...what the hell? Why are we having a war on pot?   Results of ending the war on drugs: no more tax money being spent, millions of Americans' lives will be instantly better as they will not be incarcerated, etc. A new industry will be created that will provide tax revenue, jobs, etc. A small number (comparatively) of government workers would lose their jobs.  Results of not ending the war on drugs: DEA agents, etc. and others will not lose their jobs. Politicians will continue to have something to be proud of and market themselves with. People will continue to use drugs anyway, as history has shown and nothing will change as it is now and has been since it was made illegal.  An alternative to the war on drugs? We need to shift our thinking from drug addict, CRIMINALS to drug addict, PATIENTS. Meaning these people need help, not jail.

In laboratory studies, subjects given high doses of marijuana for several days or even several weeks exhibit no decrease in work motivation or productivity.

In a recent study for the Fraser Institute, Economist Stephen T. Easton, it was calculated how much tax revenue the Canadian government could gain by legalizing marijuana. So, the study estimates that the average price of 0.5 grams (a unit) of marijuana sold for $8.60 on the street, while its cost of production was only $1.70.

By contrast, 51.9 percent of Americans age 12 and older (or roughly 100 million people) had used alcohol at least once in the 30 days prior to being surveyed in America.

I have read this article it's so interesting there are many thing why cannabis shouldn't be legalize  http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/ addiction/issues/marijuana.html     One thing I learned is that marijuana does relieve pain and that it is not nearly as addictive as morphine. It can ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and, at the same time, give you a wonderful high.  Despite the positives, I am not convinced. There are so many other factors that need to be considered. Marijuana causes some parts of the brain - such as those governing the emotions, memory and judgment - to spin out of control.If you choose to ignore the attacks and memory loss, consider what marijuana can do to your lungs. Its smoke carries more tar and other particles than tobacco. You can relieve your migraine, but you also have a higher chance of developing lung cancer.To drug policy reformers, prohibition of marijuana is not just a cause to be supported, but a mandatory way of life, necessary to uphold society’s moral fiber.

Marijuana smokers who abstain from tobacco sometimes boast that their drug of choice is safer than cigarettes. The truth is that both tobacco and marijuana have damaging effects. Those who smoke both cigarettes and marijuana suffer the compound consequences of two different drugs destroying their health simultaneously.That's why advice to all smokers don't smoke because you can die early",0,2

Medically, marijuana has shown some promise in relieving pain and increasing appetite.

I, however love greek plays and even though greek plays do upset some people, there are much worse problems in the world.  For one, why does the government outlaw a plant, but it doesn't outlaw war?  In fact, why does the government SUPPORT war?  What is war? Killing.  Perhaps one should questions your government's motives before blindly obeying.",0,1
342,"Marijuana seems to be opposed purely on an indoctrinational basis.   Because it is relatively harmless, because it does not cause hysteria or murder or other horrible effects, the only reason sane people would so strongly desire to outlaw a plant is because they were taught from an early age that this plant is horrible and illegal.  Nearly everyone opposed to it has never tried it more than once. It is well known that not everyone feels the effects of it the first time, so when they say ""It doesn't work"", and they continue to agree with the government, it only hurts people who do enjoy using it.  If it was harmful, then why do so many intelligent people use it? The founding fathers grew it, and everyone knows about Carl Sagan.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.   And even if it was harmful, how can anyone tell me what I can and can't put into my own body? If I was a child, I would understand, but I think I can research this stuff on my own well enough to understand what marijuana is and then consume it without guidance.  If the government wants to interfere in my life, then I would like a massive research grant so I can do science and hopefully improve the world for everyone.",0,1

348,"Technically speaking, the war on drugs does employ people. So that's a plus to it, right? Besides, marijuana is illegal for a reason. People abuse the drug as it is. If they legalize it, the abuse will grow exponentially. This applies for any illegal substance. If alcohol is made legal, for example, underaged drinkers would drink so much more than they did when it was legal. Of course, this could slow down over time, but do we really want that initial boom of drug abuse which we don't know when it will end?",1,2

There would still be a lot of private growers to circumvent the taxes on it and to make it cheaper. I'd say the same for cigarettes, but tobacco is not the only thing in there. It's a precise mixture of dozens of substances and chemicals, so people can't exactly manufacture that on their own.",1,2

Hopefully, then the amount of smokers could go down without a ban.",1,2
355,"Honestly, I thought this debate was over. I got enough opposition. :)  But when I look into legalizing something, I try to look at the worst case scenario and a likely scenario and combine them. In the case of pot, I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions (don't say it's not addicting. I  know  people that are addicted.) Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America. Productivity would go down :) and some people would simply do reckless things.",1,2

357,""" Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal. ""  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)  And the website was about tobacco smoke. I knew that. But I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well.",1,2

368,"The War on Drugs is not only a moral problem but a economic problem. First, it is morally wrong because the government restricts the free choice of individuals to participate in such substances, and the number of people people killed every year with selling or buying drugs is simply unnecessary and unjust. When someone engages in the use of drugs, it is the decision of that person and they are only hurting themselves nor the government.  Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well. The government would have 10 billion dollars to spend elsewhere. It would eliminate drug cartels. Not only is the enforcement costly, but by criminalizing these people, taxpayers have to pay for them in live in prisons throughout America.  The only negative aspect is that it may lead to a increase in drug addicts.",1,1
369,The problem is that people under the influence of marijuana are more likely to commit crimes.   There is not a single shred of scientific evidence to support this notion.,1,1
370,"Common sense does. Have you ever seen people do stupid things while under the influence of marijuana?   So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your ""common sense"" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.  Marijuana causes lethargy, which greatly decreases ""dangerous activities"". Someone who is high on Marijuana is not going to rob a bank, or steal a car, however there is a good chance they will sit on the couch and stare in amazement as a piece of lint floats by, or watch a movie about talking animals.   But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next).   Heavy long term usage can impair short-term memory, outside of that there really isn't any. Drinking bleach isn't all that good, yet it is not illegal.    Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use?   Not personally, no.   There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   When people don't have an income, they get desperate, especially when they want more money for their next fix. Desperate people do desperate (and often illegal) things.   {Laughs!}  Their ""fix""?  {Laughs some more}  Thank you for demonstrating you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. The sad thing is that a lot of people don't know why that's so funny. We aren't talking about heroine here, we're talking about weed. There's no such thing as a marijuana ""fix"". Marijuana is not addictive. People DONT go through marijuana withdraws, people can go through caffeine withdraws. Marijuana is less addictive than caffeine, which is why your statement that they ""need to get their fix"" is incredibly asinine. You obviously don't know anything about marijuana, which is funny because you want it to be illegal.  Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.  Prohibition obviously doesn't work, which is why so many people still do marijuana, many people are sitting behind bars (costing taxpayer dollars) who should not be there in the first place. Marijuana does not hurt anybody.  I don't even like marijuana, but I can't think of a single good reason for it to be illegal.",1,1
371,"No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds.   Do you support a ban on Alcohol?   I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Well, the principal you are trying to demonstrate doesn't help your argument, when other invalid conclusions can be drawn from the same line of reasoning.   ""According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old."" -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   I would really like to know what this article defines as ""dependency"" because I happen to know that marijuana does not produce withdraw when it's use is ceased.  In the broad sense almost anything can be addicting, or abused. I could abuse Tylenol, but that does not mean it is inherently addictive. So please define your terms here.   Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.",1,1
372,What makes you think that if we legalize marijuana more people will drive under it's influence? This is mere conjecture.,1,2

Alcohol, tobacco, and even caffeine are great examples...   ...of completely legal drugs.   great examples of why marijuana should not be legalized.

There have been exactly ZERO cases of marijuana overdose.   Marijuana makes you sleepy and hungry   And this is a valid reason for it to be illegal????   it is USELESS.   So are many other legal things. Being useless is not sufficient reason to make something illegal.  This is a lazy argument.",1,1

Marijuana is not addictive, it doesn't cause cancer, you cannot overdose on it, and it doesn't make you any more likely to commit other crimes.

I've not seen a single convincing argument for why Marijuana should be illegal.",1,1
376,"I agree with most of this, although I am talking about addiction in the medical sense, that withholding a substance will cause withdraws. Conversely nearly anything could be ""mentally addictive"" but that's more of a result of a weak state of mind that it is of an inherent addictive quality that something may posses.   I agree that because something is harmful for oneself is not reason enough to may something illegal. If someone wishes to harm their own body, this is no concern of the Government.",1,1

Especially when alcohol is the stuff that actually makes people aggressive and ruins families and can lead to abuse. If   anything  is gunna be illegal, make it alcohol.   And no I don't think It will do wonders for the economy.",1,1
436,"I guess so. I figured that if all the other legal and marketable things aren't helping why would it? But I guess it would do a lot.  Edit: You're tagged as ""No"" by the way. You can change that when you post an argument.",1,1
437,"Lol well, I think it's the other way around about the fast food thing. Almost impossible to like  marijuana  and not like  fast food . (;   About alcohol, I'm just saying it's crazy that weed is illegal and alcohol isn't. Doesn't necessarily mean it should be illegal. The government shouldn't worry about what we consume. But if I had to choose between alcohol and weed to be illegal I would choose alcohol for sure.   And I agree about the money it could make, I had that discussion with ReichPride and changed my mind.",1,1
438,"If I could type an emoticon of eyes rolling, I would. Consider my eyes rolled. If you want to talk about gateway drugs, let's talk about alcohol and tobacco, the two legal, harmful drugs that lead people to try other ones.   ""There are many people who don't smoke pot because it is illegal""--This is an argument for the efficacy of prohibition, which, if we're being honest, is fairly ineffective. I could just as easily argue there are many people who smoke pot in spite of it being illegal. Does either argument address whether or not it ought to be legalized? No.   Marijuana has no business being illegal when it is less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is not only legal but used by a large portion of the population. Alcohol poisoning kills people every year, as does drunk driving. Marijuana cannot be overdosed on, nor does it make people over-confident or belligerent.   The latest marijuana ads have been more accurate than in years past. ""We didn't shoot anybody. We just sat on Pete's couch"". Granted, the point is made, marijuana users are less likely to be active. Then again, we could make the same argument about cable television watchers, couldn't we?",1,1
439,"This pothead hippy can spell welfare and wipe (and form complete sentences!). That would make me more educated than you, nay?",1,1
440,"For the record, smoking marijuana is not the only way to enjoy it.   So, while y'all can debate the harmful effects of smoking it, just keep in mind that really none of them can be valid arguments of keeping it illegal.",1,1
441,"First, you have done drugs yourself, because alcohol IS a drug. It's simply a legal one like tobacco. And as someone who has been around both and tried both and tried both in excess, it's my opinion that alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than marijuana.   Marijuana does inflict harm to the self, but that's where it ends. People don't get high and then get belligerent, angry, and violent. They don't get high and drive overconfidently at 90 mph. I'm not saying driving under the influence of marijuana is by any means safe, but in comparison to alcohol, it is a lot safer. When you're under the influence of alcohol, you become overconfident in your abilities and drive without the normal care and caution you would have. Your vision is also blurred and reaction times slowed. Under marijuana, again your reaction times are slowed, but unlike using alcohol, when you drive under the influence of marijuana you drive with more care and caution than normal. It's the positive effect of paranoia. Furthermore, you can overdose on alcohol and die from it, which is an impossibility with marijuana.   It's interesting that you bring up prohibition and then state that you're afraid it will cause problems because people will become ""addicted"" to it. Prohibition is an excellent example to bring up. What did history teach us about prohibition? That it doesn't work. People will always self medicate, and so long as the substances they are using are absent of any serious effects, they will continue using those substances.   In fact, legalization of marijuana may cut down on the ""gateway"" effect of the drug (though I don't buy the gateway argument in and of itself, but more on that later). Many people try marijuana after being taught by the government's propaganda what a terrible awful drug it is. Once they try it and learn the truth, that it's very similar to alcohol, with a few key differences, they begin to question the government's authority on other drugs as well. ""If they lied to me about marijuana, maybe cocaine's not all that bad either.""   On the other hand, let me say this to the gateway argument. Tobacco and alcohol are the number one and number two gateway drugs. So if we call marijuana a gateway, let us only do so after calling out the top two.   As far as medicinal marijuana goes, you've obviously either done little to no research on the topic or you lack compassion. You state that cancer patients use it to numb the pain of treatment and to make them hungry in order to counteract the effects of nausea from treatment. I ask, what is wrong with that? It seems that if people are going through a very painful and difficult treatment (that may not even succeed) they might be entitled to pain relief and some semblance of a normal life (i.e. being able to eat normally). Nobody claims that marijuana ""cures"" anything, it's pain medication, much like morphine, demerol, vicodin, etc. AND it's natural. No pharmaceutical company has mixed in chemical compounds to create it. I get terrible menstrual cycles, they've always been awful and have gotten worse as I've gotten a bit older. The only thing that successfully treats the pain and discomfort I feel during those first two days is, you guessed it, marijuana.   Prohibition has been tried...for seventy years. And rather than reduce marijuana use, now nearly half of the country admits to having tried the substance. We waste money on criminalization of marijuana and we create crime. If marijuana were available legally, drug dealers would be out of business, and users would no longer have to be jailed at your expense. The government would be able to tax the substance and make a pretty penny off of people's use of it as well.   There's no proof that use of marijuana would increase if prohibition ended. It would make us all safer and save us a ton of money. I'm sick of the hypocrisy of alcohol-users in regards to marijuana. If you want to oppose it, fine, but you sure as hell better oppose it's uglier, scarier brother, Alcohol, first.",1,1
442,"explain why legalizing a drug would remove it as a gateway drug?  ""It also removes a major gateway to other more dangerous illegal substances.""  If its a gateway drug its a gateway drug legal or not.",1,1
443,"I disagree, a gateway drug means you get high and in-turn want to get higher by any means necessary so you move on to another drug. I have known kids who smoke pot and move on to moms medicine chest, no dealer involved.",1,2
444,"Sounds like your blaming everyone but your Ex! sometimes we as humans have to take responsibility for our own actions. He was looking for a high and he was going to get it either from a drug dealer or over the counter cold remedies, making Marijuana legal will not change this.",1,2
445,"I would have to say no! because to smoke Marijuana you would have to light it then smoke it, which will increase your carbon foot print and intern cause Global Warming and kill the polar bears. large areas of land will become hot and humid which will intern become great farm land on which to grow pot... am i rambling? I'm fucking high.... legalize it!",1,2
446,"Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I think we could save so much time and money just by treating Marijuana like a mixture of Cigarettes and Alcohol.  You don't smoke in public places.  You don't drive while under the influence.  And we can tax it. I'd bet it would still be cheaper than today. It wouldn't be such a risk to transport and sell, and more people would be doing it.",1,1
447,"Well, yes, people still do those things. Don't people still murder other people? Don't people still embezzle money? All this still happens, but because it is illegal, it takes place less often. Don't people still sell marijuana and don't people still smoke it? Yes, they do. It's just much more dangerous and expensive to do so because it's illegal.  I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above. I've made it thus far without them, and I don't have any real reason to start now. So, because of this, I can say that I have reasoning beyond what is simply personally more convenient.   The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads? Or maybe we could put this money towards something we can all enjoy, like lowering taxes. There are just better ways to spend our money.  You make good points, and I understand what you are getting at, I just wholeheartedly disagree.",1,1
448,"People don't use Marijuana to  cure  anything, just in the same way we don't use Aspirin or any other painkiller, or most medicines, to cure anything, as most medicines are used to treat the symptoms until the ailment goes away, or, if it never does, to make life a bit more bearable.   Prohibition didn't work for a reason. People don't take too well to getting their freedoms taken away. Alcohol was part of the national culture. While marijuana is not part of our national culture, we would still be better off making it legal.",1,1

451,"I agree. I hate how their's so many shows nowadays about how pot should be legalized or how theirs shows that show the medical pot stores in california and how pople hold rallies and riot to try and get pot legalized. I have smoked pot atleast 150+ times in my life(i haven't smoked pot in atleast 7+ months, and have only smoked it 4 times in the last 4 years), so i know what it's like to be high, and the only way i could see someone thinking that marijuanna is a medicine would be if your high when you say that. Their is no way that marijuanna could be a medicine. I hated the feeling of being high, and if you look up Cannabis and mental disorders, then you'll find that cannabis does more harm to you than good(the only reason people say it's good is because it numbs them and makes the pain go away).    I personally think that if they legalize it, then The United States will sooner or later fall apart.",1,2
452,"that would also probly be considered child endangerment by law enforcement, but do whatever you want right?",1,1
453,"i agree. Cannabis isn't 100% legal in any country in the whole world(for anyone who doesn't believe this, look it up(yes, it isn't legal in Amsterdam or Jamaica like people believe)). Since it isn't legal in any country in the whole world, then if we legalize it, all the gangs who sell cannabis will move to the United States, because they can do their operation without getting in trouble. We would be taken over by the Mexican Cartel, plus the cartel would most likely rob every Marijuanna store their is.",1,2
454,"At the end of your ""essay"" you act as though it was good to legalize alcohol in the first place. Just because something is legal now doesn't mean that it should have been in the first place, and second, i think that marijuanna shouldn't be legalized is because(no matter what potheads say) their has been research done on the effects of smoking Cannabis, and the results were not good. Just go on google and type in something like ""Cannabis and mental disorders"" or something like that, and you'll find a ton of sites that show the research that Cannabis is bad for your brain. Have you ever noticed that the only people who want to legalize pot are people who smoke it themselves, or are related to someone who does. All i have to say is that science(research) will have the final say into whether or not it's bad for you.",1,2
