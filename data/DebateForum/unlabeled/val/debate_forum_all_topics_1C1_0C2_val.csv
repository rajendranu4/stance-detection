1191,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?    Yes.   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.",0,1

875,"only 19% of polled people believe ""abortion is wrong no matter what""  I'm assuming at least 4% of those don't understand specific diseases that account for around 1-3% of abortions performed because the fetus is grotesquely misformed and birthing it will result in the fetus' death within minutes and potentially the mother's death if not aborted.  So yeah, 15%.  The problem is for you, most don't know about abortion, what it actually entails, why it is actually performed, in what numbers, and what women did before it was available.  Once they know these numbers; that before it was legal there were just as many abortions but instead they were performed in alleys and basements, that the vast majority that have abortions do it in the first 2-4 weeks, that the vast majority also were either raped or are having an aborition due to some medical issue, or that the women you and your ilk constantly demonize, the ones who casually decide on this course of action make up such a low percent you might as well outlaw instances of albino,  then even those answering ""oh yeah whatever, I'm pro-life"" would actually change to pro-choice.

1177,"First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion.   If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.",0,1

1556,"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.",0,1

Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty.   To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.  I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance. If we want to prosper as a nation we have to believe in our fellow man and that he will do what's right, however, that faith will not come without regulations to protect the system from those of us that would abuse it.",1,1

380,"Is an acorn a tree?  Is an egg a chicken?  So on and so on... Grow up..   No, but an acorn is the nut of an oak tree, and a chicken egg is the egg of a chicken, it would be a scientific anomaly if they were to grow into anything else. Are you denying that we are referring to a human fetus? what did you think this debate was about?  Regardless, we’re not talking about an acorn or egg, both of those have all the necessary parts to develop into their adult counterparts on their own, save for proper sunlight and water for the seed or warmth for the egg. A human fetus requires another life to create it and then sustain it until well into adolescence. Whether it is a nine week old fetus or a nine day old newborn baby, it requires another life form. This should be considered  before  people decide to just skip out on the birth control and take the risk of having an unwanted pregnancy.   Personally I don't give a fuck if people get abortions, I doesn't affect me in the least so why should I care? Living things die every day; death is just a part of life. What I  do  care about are people taking responsibility for their actions. If you don't want a baby, no duh, don't get pregnant. If you take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy and get pregnant anyway or if, god forbid, you were to get raped, then by all means, have an abortion if that’s what you want. No skin off my nose.  And what’s with the personal insult? Grow up? I think it’s obvious from that remark alone that I am not the one lacking maturity. Personal attacks like that have no place in a debate.",1,0

As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself. Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right? What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?  You stand by and watch people kill each other during war. What kind of love is this? Yes, you can do something concerning abortions. Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this. That is the main point of my argument. I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.  What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'? Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion.

And rape......in your opinion it is wrong...but what about other cultures?   And Hitler, he killed those who thought inferior and weak. Murder has always existed. But peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented. There are those who think our participation in the ME wars were wrong that they served no good. Others disagree. So evil is in the eye of the beholder. So when you say fight evil with evil.....its subjective, because people might not agree which side is right and which side is wrong. Yet you say there is only one truth. How do you determine what is truth on your own? And should everyone be subjected to YOUR way of thinking?  It is not radical to say something is wrong.  And stop calling me names...you look foolish. Your example is sick. You fall in love with a child.....???? A child is a child...and it is never right to have sex with a child if you are an adult. There are laws to prevent this from happening...to keep children safe..from your way of thinking. Love can destroy people, families and communities.   You said, ""Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.""  FActs about abortion? I doubt that. What facts do you know just curious.   ""You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.""   The fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being. The abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing. That is a biological fact.   So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.  I find it sad that in your post you defend evil. Where is the balance in that?  ""Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness.""  For people who live godless lives it might. For people who do not consider all human life sacred....for those who are moral relativists it might. I find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious. That they lose the right to live while in this state. People who are in comas, under for surgeries...even sleeping is a form of being unconscious. So because a child is in the womb...does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically. When I was pregnant I used to push in on my baby....and prode it until it moved....aware of my touch.   Your view on life is sad. Vegetable people are nothing? You are so so cold.

And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies. 15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.   16 However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. 17 Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you. 18 Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God.

950,"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas.   As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.  Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.  Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.  In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.  Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights.   No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.  I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them.",0,1

I don't sit the fence, I say the radical opinions are idiotic, and it's foolish to not think they are. To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.   Why do I say that? Well, simple: humans cannot judge humanity with our mere senses. The fact that we can't is the reason racism and fascism and sexism exists in the first place. You can't judge humanity by yourself and neither can I. Nobody can.  But we're supposed to be beyond that sort of thing. Open-thought and technology accelerate us as a race. We're better then to take radical sides anymore.   With that said, what constitutes a human being? Most would agree that a consciousness, a soul, constitutes a human being. We can't measure a consciousness without machines, but we can still do it.   If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.   It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.   You cannot measure it's soul without measuring it's consciousness, so you cannot presume that it has a soul before it has a consciousness, but you  can  presume that is has a soul during and after it has a consciousness because you can measure it's consciousness.  Therefore, abortion is moral up until the fetus develops a consciousness. Afterwards, it is a human being and cannot be aborted. If it is aborted at that point, it is murder. Before then, it's not.   To say that one radical side is right over the other is foolish. Both sides are illogical and presumptuous. Neutrality is the only logic and morality.",0,1

Most scientists agree that pain is experienced in the cortical areas of the brain, which do not develop until the second trimester. Painful experiences result in autonomic (they occur automatically during pain) physiologic changes that can be measured. For example, when we fell pain, our bodies produce endorphins and cortisol to help deal with the pain. One study was conducted on fetuses during blood draws. This study showed elevated fetal plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin response to intrauterine needling early in the second trimester but not before.  So the first trimester is an ideal time for abortion which is when most occur anyway. It's extended mostly for medical reasons as some deformities and disabilities cannot be detected until the second trimester which is a time I will agree the woman has a right to an abortion in the second trimester.

I wish I could color code stuff, but bold will represent things that are nothing special or would have most likely been done by McCain and italics will represent something that should not be the government's job or something that is not even an accomplishment.   1. Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.  Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations. This will be no different. If nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great American President for this alone despite knee-jerk ""there's a monster in your closet"" reaction from the perpetually scared right.

Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  I oppose the war, but I'll give him credit for recent success.   And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending   Trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   See above.  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  I'll give him credit... though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay.   1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  Good.   1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB   McCain would have likely done something similar.   1.Ended media blackout on war casualties; reporting full information   Seeing as every tv station not named Fox is in the tank for him this is not much of accomplishment.   1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  Good.   1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act   Until what goes on behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve and Obama's negotiations with Unions and Democrats this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   Really? They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.  1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.  1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?

38,"I do not support a ban on Alcohol. Nor Do I support a ban on Marijuana. In fact, I have not spent one single moment of my time here saying that it should remain illegal. All I am saying is that it does alter one's state of mind which can lead to crime just as alcohol can, whether it's addictive or not. We need to be prepared for the ramifications of legalizing Marianna if/when it happens.    If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only ""contributing to crime"" because it's illegal.   That's not the same logic. Ideally, marijuana use would be legal, driving would be legal, and they would never happen at the same time. But suppose it does, and someone mows down a pedestrian at a crosswalk and gets charged with manslaughter. In that case, marijuana use would be a contributor to the crime, but not illegal in itself, much like alcohol is now.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing ""driving under the influence"" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.   I agree. But just like alcohol, people will still use it and drive. Especially if it's made legal. Again, I don't advocate it remaining illegal based on that principal, but we must be ready to deal with more high drivers, because that's probably what will happen.",1,1

These eggs have to be fertilized to create a fetus. If left unchecked as long as the fetus is healthy a human being will be formed inside the womans womb. If a woman doesnt want a child its her responsibility to prevent it from getting started. Women have plenty of ways to prevent unwanted prgnancy. Killing a fetus is wrong. Its a very young human. You can argue details but bottom line is it will one day, if all goes well,become a functioning member of the human race. Terminating this is murder. The question we need to ask is why do we have this problem in our ""advanced"" civilization. Most abortions are from unwanted pregnancy not rapes or medical conditions. Are women not ready for their rights? Mass murder of undeveloped humans because of irresponsibilty. We shouldn't condone this behavior as a womans right.

On the other hand, there are many instances where birth control has failed, cannot be taken due to allergies, or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a woman’s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy.

The reason when I asked my broker was they had no reason even when the regulators set out the new rules they targeted 403B and their reason according to my broker who is an expert on the markets said they had none. Great! So this is the great regulation we where all waiting for not allowing people to get their own money out. This just happened to me today. There's a lot more to the story but it is so frustrating that I will get even more mad. Basically the new regulation is a form of pure Socialism. My money, won't let me have it. I have to make up some lie just to get it out like I'm sick or something or I have a hardship which I don't but that's besides the point. I don't know if you own a home or business but if you did you would see the huge amount of more taxes you pay just to own a home or business it's stifling.

THE RISK IS ALWAYS THERE....unless the woman or the man is sterile. If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection....and that protection broke....how do you think she would feel? Anxious? Worried? If a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man...and later learned she forget to take one the day before...how would she feel? Worried? Sure she would....because mistakes happen...but that does not change the risk factor that she took. The risk was there...and human error, condom malfunctions can happen. How is that the fault of the new life they both created? It is unfortunate, but nevertheless, the life got started.   I dont think it should be individual opinion....it should be what the facts state. And it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being. Now its small, but that does not change its state. A little ant working hard on a hill....has all it needs to live....its small...but the workings of his bodily system works. And a fetus however small...has the same qualities...but is human. The heart starts at around twenty days...and every day grows and something develops. The issue is...does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent. We have people here who are against killing animals for food, but they are pro-abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral. Figure that one out.   If you say they are responsible..is the responsible thing to do is kill it? How responsible is that? Do you think that two wrongs make a right?   You say there should be no laws to enslave the woman, that she should NOT be forced to carry a baby to full term. That means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month. So don't come back and say........""ooops...now I don't mean that...only until its viable.."" And gee when is viablity and what does that matter....the woman does not want it...and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants. Anythink less as i said would enslave her and FORCE HER TO DO WHAT YOU SAY, NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO...in this case our government. How humane is your statement really? Donating blood does not kill anyone.   And in the United States we can really force people to give blood. When someone is arrested for drunk driving...most often they have to give blood. Denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence.

300,"Answer these questions.  How is government funded? Does government possess any assets without taxation? Does government have any financial authority without taxation?   Technically speaking our government owns nothing because it is public, however practically speaking it owns its institutions and their collective works.  Does a business have any financial authority without charging a bill? In other words, speaking in the context of our discussion, taxation and a private bill are practically the same.   Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.   It doesn't matter if a business generates income by itself, it matters if it generates it by exchange with others.   There is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the private sector by law.   Does not change the fact that they are not transferred jobs, but created ones.   Again, you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services. The private sector is may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as NASA or USPS.   Only the wealthiest oil corporations could hope to touch our military budget, and yet they fall short by about half. That is to say nothing of medical research, aerospace research and engineering, and physics research like the LHC which are all in addition to the military budget.   All of the employees who work at NASA or Defense, whose money is it that they are using. Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money can from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   They use their own money, which comes from providing a service to the public (taxes), through trade of goods (technology to the private sector and other governments).   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.   It really isn't that simple, because a portion of that 40% is often made accessible to the people in the form of student aid, welfare, unemployment, social security, schools, medicine, etc. The other 60% as utilised by the private sector is never distributed in a manner approaching equality and that is why you have one percent of the people holding fourty percent of it (which would mean as per your numbers that 1% of the people hold 16% of the nation's economy in their hands).  To answer your actual question however, what I mean by surplus wealth is that wealth which is beyond the living means of the owner.   For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. So, now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   It's the same exact issue with private companies. If you have 100 dollars, and this is the total GDP, and a business charges you 5$ for medicine, you now have 95$ and the business has 5$. The business did not increase the GDP to 105$. Conservation of wealth, like conservation of energy.   Milton  Milton   I never cared for Milton Friedman's opinion. He's a bit of a nutter.   This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   Keynesian economics is merely the idea that government can intervene to stimulate the market where it is acting with reduced efficiency.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.   You just explained how a government uses tax, and the behaviours surrounding government borrowing. What I'm interested in is the fundamental changing of hands which both sales and taxes employ.   And that money is who money does it belong to.   It would be the government's money, since they provided a service and you are paying for it.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Same thing.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.   The healthcare act is not socialised medicine. It is private medicine, which means that the ""rationed care"" you speak of is a capitalist phenomenon.   Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many. REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.  Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   It is a matter of the ""welfare of the few, for the many"" because right now those bad ethics are wildly illegal. If they were not, it wouldn't be the few any longer but a large number of annual deaths and deformities caused by standard medical research practice.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   Most of them you hardly notice: roads, research, technological development, military, police, courts. Also: government put a man on the moon and a probe on mars. What has big business done for you?   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   I don't.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   Just wait until you get fired or laid off from your career at age fifty, and are desperate to find work for almost a year but no one hires you because you're old and they want new, young professionals. You really have no empathy for these people because you're too self-absorbed.  One other detail: since many thousands of them would be laid off, this means that the market would be suddenly flooded with people who have the same credentials, which means they would probably receive lower salaries on top of losing their retirement.   I am certain that one man, Branson, will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks. Maybe, space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it.   I'm not as hopeful, look at airline security and how often a plane crashes.

130,"Murder is a legal definition. It is the unlawful killing of another human being. Thus Abortion is not Murder. Shooting a burglar is ""taking someone's life without permission"" however that is not murder either.   The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute. What right is more basic that control over our own body. You have the right not have an operation, or medical care or drugs.

1124,"The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime..   Let me ask you a question. Are you aware of foetal development? The first four weeks after having unprotected sex, there isn't even an embryo yet. Once you have the embryo it's weeks before it even develops into a foetus, which means it is a few cells with no mind or organs. 50% of abortions happen before the woman even has a foetus inside her. Once it becomes a foetus, it's another 7 to 9 weeks before it even has a heart pumping blood. The brain is still in the process of growing. 40% of abortions happen before this point in foetal development.  You are acting emotionally when you should be detached. This is a rational situation, not an emotional one.   It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.   The unborn baby has no rights at this point. It isn't a person yet. Maybe it bothers you to think of people in a way that allows them at some point to no longer be people. Humanity doesn't suffer from abortions, the only way it could suffer is if abortions were so common that our death rate exceeded our birth rate, but this isn't the case. Morals and god are irrelevant, because those are beliefs and values that belong to you and only you, they aren't exactly shared by the women having abortions so it is a case of you imposing your god and your morals upon someone else against their will.   Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?!   The woman is taking responsibility by terminating the pregnancy. In her case it would be irresponsible to have a child that isn't wanted and would grow up lacking the support it needs.   Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?!   Protected sex can lead to pregnancy, depending upon the failure rates of the contraceptives used. Also bear in mind that the religious groups you're supporting by bringing god into this are often against contraception, and spread misinformation about it, such as ""condoms contain holes"" or ""condoms have HIV inside of them."" In this respect they are against the methods that prevent pregnancy and are against the tools that stop pregnancy as well, they seem to want women to function as baby-factories, or live a celibate lifestyle.   In the case where you were ""raped"", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever..   And then she has a child who is a reminder of the man who abused her. The child will suffer for this, and that's how you end up with a more dysfunctional society: children neglected by their mothers who wind up on the streets as thieves or gang members.   In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?!   If it's unexpected, it could be that the child will be raised in poverty because the mother can't afford it.   No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...

197,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",1,1

708,"Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not.   This is  EXACTLY  where you are wrong. Are you so dense and stupid that you can't understand simple English? If you can't, then it would be beneath me to honour you with a reply, which I have been doing for a long time and my patience is wearing thin. Knowledge is what philosophers term as  ""justified true belief"" . What this means is that to be considered ""knowledge"", a belief must be  both  justified and true. If you can't understand this, then you are truly stupid.   Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact.   Wrong. See above.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?""   You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?""   What is the ""normal""? Be specific.   I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.   As long as you are not specific, you are wrong with the definition. That is the idea of ""defining"".   Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter.   Contrary to your warped  belief , it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   it is mostly female homosexuals.   First, that is  not  what you have said. Second, prove that it is "" mostly  female homosexuals""? Finally,  so what  if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter  all  three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   However, without people, there isn't a society in existence.   This debate isn't about  propogating  homosexuality, it  is  about acceptance. I am not saying that homosexuality should be promoted. What I am saying is that they should be accepted. Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   Society cannot grow independently of population.   Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism.   What you said is that   "" all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow""  . Imperialism only occurs with  some societies ,  NOT  all societies.   An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed.   Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality.   Which is contradictory to what you have said.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law.

An economic bubble is commonly used term to describe an economic or business cycle that is best characterized by the rapid expansion followed by the contraction in a economy often times in dramatic fashion.    I am pretty sure that I said that before because I explained it in a previous statement. ""Economic trough is consequence of a business cycle after there was a peak in expansion.

There is no maximum.  Social Security includes unemployment benefits. So, if the government didn't tax our wages for unemployment benefits, that extra money people earn without the tax, they could save that money instead getting unemployment benefits if they are unemployed. As for veterans and disabilities, sure they are entitled to social security.

I don't think the source of that idea has been explored enough though. And personally, I believe in humilating idiotic statements as a form of social punishment, so here goes. Hopefully you read this Jake.  gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would  choose  to be gay instead of heterosexual.  that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.  ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?

756,"I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like ""it will ruin your life"" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?",0,0

By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.    Abortion  is  a consequence. Do you think it is a comfortable, fun activity people undergo in their leisure time? It is an emotionally trying, incredibly difficult decision to make, and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases. Especially for young people, it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives. It is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed, or her contraception failed her. Do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex, that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences'?   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.   It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life. I only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she doesn't want.

If she doesn't use any precaution, then it's her fault for being irresponsible and she should carry the baby to term. Adoption is very successful and if she doesn't want to go through that, then she could always raise the baby anyway. Now if she uses protection in some form, but it fails, then she could always take a morning after pill, like Plan B. Pills like that safely ""miscarry"", for lack of better term, before the egg and sperm become fertilized. Other than that, she has no right to end a life.

33,"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  ""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.",1,1
1712,"1. This is not always the case. There are some forms of retardation in which they never achieve these. I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description. People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society. Now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance. If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?  2.

They speak against the validness of the article, and portray good arguments. Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   I'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession, I'm talking about the very necessities of his office. In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.""   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it ""helps"".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most.

699,"Ah, yes. ReventonRage did pointed out a contradiction. However, both of you and him is forgetting the point. The point is that in one perspective or sense, it is wrong to be a homosexual. And in another sense, it is right to be a homosexual. I gave the reason why.   The truth can be contradicting but it doesn't mean that it isn't the truth.  I believe another point that you two are forgetting that there is a right and a wrong to every side. Being a homosexual is naturally right and wrong. Being a non-homosexual (straight male and female) can be both right and wrong.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   This is one sense in which being a homosexual is right. You must had implied that i implied that this is the only way that they are right. No. Another way to advance as humans is education. Homosexuals can become teacher, scientists, mathmaticians, etc. I didn't pointed it out because i wanted to provide a short but simple comment to Apollo.    This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.   I should been more clearer. In many senses, a non-homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race. A homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race.   It is contradicting but this is still the truth.  Edit. Homosexuals are wrong because they stop the world from populating. Homosexuals are right because they stop overpopulation. Those are two contradicting but truthful statements. In a ""sense"" if one person can't produce an offspring, he or she is opposing the purpose of life in ONE WAY. In another ways, he or she can support it. Hence people can be both right and wrong. Not producing an offsprings opposes the purpose of life by not increasing your own race in numbers.   In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D",0,1

196,"People cannot sell themselves into slavery, people cannot give other people permission to murder them, people cannot give up their inalienable constitutional rights to due process...etc..etc. People don't have the right to take away their rights and freedoms; if someone is mutilating their body, attempting suicide, or engaging in obviously harmful activities our laws clearly indicate we have the right to detain and provide psychological treatment to them.   Noone left me in charge, I have an opinion. We are all imposing our beliefs about what is best for ourselves and each other when engaging in democratic activity so I don't see the problem with my objections to and sanctions of narcotics.   The difference between escaping through activity and escaping through chemical alteration is the difference between exercise and steroid injections. It is the difference between increasing your height through a proper diet while still in your development stages and breaking your legs and resetting them repeatedly.   Not only is the activity unnecessary, a cop-out, and usually not even a remedy for a real malady, but it is an extreme approach and ultimately detrimental to the person's body, mind, and their professional life.   What I am saying is that in the case of drugs people are willfully giving up their freedoms; I would like to have it given back. Besides, if they are already giving up their freedom and humanity for a little pleasure, why on earth should they have the rights in the first place? Would you give a teenager a car if they decided to wreck it, on purpose, every time just to experience the thrill?   People shouldn't be allowed to choose to be slaves just as much as people aren't allowed to be slave-owners. I find it frightening that people seem to actively look to be controlled, by addiction or dictators, and I don't want such behavior to go unchecked.   Video games are an absence of the use of freedom, chemical alterations remove them or block them. Chemicals destroy personality and individuality, pass-times merely divert them and slow their growth or actualization.   Again, Marijuana isn't a big deal in this respect; but legalizing it certainly doesn't help. It does dull the senses, it does have long-term psychological and intellectual effects, and it is possibly as if not more carcinogenic than Tobacco and just as addictive (not yet completely substantiated so I could be wrong).  Some basic facts on it can be found here; a rather well-rounded survey of Marijuana and its effects:   http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    From the site:  ""Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.""  ""A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia.""  Now, that, again, is not known to be 100% true. Marijuana research is still in its developing stages (probably due to its illegality) and so not enough is known to say anything with certainty.   I'd like to see more studies to make sure that it is as benign as many people like to think it is. If it turns out to be then I have even less of a problem with it. The hard drugs, however, should always be illegal in my eyes.",1,0

It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother. It is alive and an individual. Again there are people born who are never self-aware, some who never feel, so on your view are they not people? The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival, but so is a newborn, so is an infant, and so is a child. These are all different stages of development of an individual human being. It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life.  3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans. I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings; it gets us nowhere. Let's stick with medical facts.  4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you. In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism, akin to poisoning you to death. Not your nails or hair, but your entire self. If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded, comatose, and senile elderly. Moss and insects are a red herring.  You're getting too emotional with the argument. I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you.

This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal.

I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle   I believe  you are right . I think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. – I think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. As I tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire US Code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. Additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. Even treaties that deal with recognition of US marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. Repealing DOMA would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today.   The only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts.  I think past compromises like don’t ask don’t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more.

1476,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.

Yet, knowing this AND knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work, they still had sex. They put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing.    That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   That is an awful analogy.

Our souls define who we are and I think it's immoral to destroy a life with an innocent soul. In the other debate I only really mention the adverse effects of killing in a physical sense. That;s because when I think of the word kill, I immediately think of murdering an adult and I suppose those reasons are the reasons why many animals do not kill their own species.  Besides, aborting a baby at any stage is not acceptable, by my standards, because the mother (or whomever decided to abort) is not giving that baby a chance at life. Who knows whether or not that baby could have become the next Albert Einstein or the next Adolf Hitler.   All I know is that it does cause pain. I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting. Is that not pain? And if you think about it, it does damage the population.

132,"Abortion is right because the moral values that ""pro life"" advocates usually hold is that of religious sediments, most of the time disregarding whether or not abortion is helpful to society. Abortion prevents unwanted children, and or growth in areas where we most certainly wouldn't want it. Abortion increases happy family rates, and higher average level of education among families. A fetus is, for all intents and purposes, part of the women until removed from the women, and before any pro lifers try to mince those words I'll go outright and say yes it does mean I support the abortion of a child no matter the stage of development, an unwanted baby that couldn't be dealt with for whatever reason at one point weeks is no different from a unwanted baby at another. Ignorant religious people argue that such barbaric elimination of human life is evil, but I find it odd that they would object to something that would result in the immediate entry to heaven(by my knowledge Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe babies who die go straight to heaven). Why subject them to the hardships of life when they aren't wanted? I also agree with the fact that mothers should have the only say in whether or not she has an abortion( I also believe however that a man who wants an abortion but gets denied should have the right to be exempt from child support) My ideas on the subject go into extremes far beyond normal pro choice standards, but I honestly feel satisfaction in knowing I support something that is beneficial to society. And before anyone questions the lack of ""morals"" behind my believes just know that in our modern world, ""morality"" has no meaning, just different perceptions developed from our understanding of religion.

Again there are people with brain damage who will never be able to do these things, given any amount of time. However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults). You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.  3. A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.  4. If this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.  5. I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed. I don't think this in any way excludes her from being a human. A child cannot sexually reproduce because their organs have not come to maturity yet.

Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt.   Argument is both invalid and fallacious.  Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious)   Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)  There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.  They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.    I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium. (the truth, falsity, or validity of an argument is not subject to a legal system)  Bare in mind that my arguments are for the sake of knowledge and not the sake of attacking or debating; so take no offence for none is intended.",1,0

958,"It is neither right nor wrong. I agree that the latest time to have an abortion should be reduced. In the UK it currently stands at 24 weeks, which is also an age a baby can survive.   I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy. If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that? I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice.  At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask? Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)?  My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating. If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet? We would be in a massive state of poverty, much more drastic than we see now.",0,1

955,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it’s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it’s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

Although I agree that eating steak isn't morally wrong, clearly there are some people who believe it is. Should these people have the right to stop you from eating steak? Should you have the right to stop homosexuals from doing what they do? The answer to both these questions is no.  3.  There are plenty of other good people who don't support gay marriage.   Just like there were plenty of other  good  people who were against womens suffrage or the civil rights movement or even slavery. Your point only shows that it;s socially acceptable to oppose rights for homosexuals, not that its right. The point of using the KKK was to try and show you an example of a group that is now infamous for its intolerance.   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage.   It's like arguing with a two year old, I swear!  Listen Jake, the point I was trying make is that it is socially acceptable to discriminate against gays. The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up.

Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?  So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well? Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.  Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus? Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?  Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?   But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with? Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it.

379,"Yes, it's no big deal as in the world won't end or society won't collapse like you said, but that's the same as a waiter bringing me an orange juice (OJ) when I asked him for a lemonade and explain to me that it's the same and it's no big deal. I mean it's a drink and it'll quench my thirst, hell it even has a similar citrusy quality, but it's not lemondade so it shouldn't be called lemondade.  .  A marriage is a bit more important than a drink and when it comes to marriage, I do actually want my children to grow up with the same idea of marriage as mine. This is because my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren, etc.. I suspect that lots of other people feel the same way, and even though things do not always turn out as perfectly as we would like, the goal should not shift. Changing the definition of the word marriage is the first step away from that goal. Sure the children will find their own ways and decide what marriage is by themselves and everything like that, and I may not have much input into the process, but  if they should ever need guidence in their lives  (and I'm sure that we all do sometime in our lives) they can come to me, and I'd guide them accordingly and I'd have a legal backup. In terms of the word marriage, I re-assert my view that its definition should even be more narrow than it is currently. Old men and young women should not be included.  .  Now, people can drink OJ and call it lemonade if they want (in Vietnam they call a cheese sandwich: ""hotdog""), I fully respect that, but I don't think that the definition of lemondade should change.

Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.  The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:  1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted. This means that less female infants would be killed and could but instead could be put up for adoption.  2) It would make genders more equal. If a woman can marry a woman and start a family without a man then this empowers women. It means that they don't need men.   Honestly I'm pretty sure that I'm not understanding you. Is this a joke?

So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!!

Then you might appreciate the fact that while a fertilised egg is alive, it isn't a life, or at least not worthy of being granted the rights of a born human life.  The whole issue that you are so passionate about is actually over the killing of fertilised eggs and tiny, unaware foetuses.   The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?

1222,"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument?   You're so wrapped up in this duality you've created you haven't even considered that my position is not one of morality. I'm not ""for"" or ""against"" abortion.   It's called ""pro CHOICE"" not ""pro abortion"". =/   You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right.   No, you've IMPOSED this position on me. This is a matter of your prejudice, not my implication.   Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact?   I don't care because it doesn't matter. I have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people. Perhaps some people end up more responsible, perhaps some don't.   The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.   To justify and prove, eh? A debate is a means, the purpose is invented by the individual. This is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own.   Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone.   You seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion. A position without opinion is just facts, a position without facts is just opinion. You need both.  I'm not arguing against the facts, I'm arguing against your stupidity. Don't try to shift the blame onto the facts, they can't help what they are.   Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case.   Because your argument is rooting in morality, mine is rooting in questioning your morality. If you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference, you're still arguing from your personal preferences.   And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself.   Then start a debate ""How did Abortion Originate?"". It's another topic and doesn't bare any relevance to this one.    Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you?   You wouldn't like my answer =p   Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.   Can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar?

You... totally missed the point -_-   Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion.   Are you dyslexic? That made almost no sense. =/  Again, look up the term ""debunking"".   But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them?   Again, I've said no such thing.

I meant retarded.   Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?   Again, either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots. ;)   Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.   Debating 101: debunking and calling out opponents on non-sequiters IS how a debate works.   There's no need to ""prove"" someone else's abortion is none of my (or your) business. Debunking your reasons for being ""pro-life"" does that by itself. Do you understand?   You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.   1+2=3 &lt;&lt; you understand this, right? Well, here's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend.   District attorneys are people. People can be stupid and childish; therefore, district attorneys can be stupid and childish.  There's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they aren't infallible.    Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.   Everything is constantly changing.

I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics and it's not actually a sentiment I disagree with, but that something is disgusting  to you  only a fact if you specify that. Disgust is subjective no matter how widely it is shared.   Perhaps in the mind of someone considering one when there are better options.   What makes an option better than abortion? Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives...   First, I am willing to operate on whatever definition of necessary you are using. You used it once in one way, and once in another way. If we've established you're not using logical necessity, that's fine.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options. What are you using to support this claim? Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Sorry, I left out ""improving"". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.   If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact, but I think this still excludes abortion. Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman.   As it is a difficult experience, I don't doubt makes some women stronger. It could also break her or ruin her life if she can't deal with it, or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires. There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.  I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not. You and I are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands, but we haven't because we're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves. Is that unacceptable?    If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.  The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/safety_of_abortion.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                        facts/post_abortion_issues.html",0,1

Borrowing money from people who print money and devalue their currency is just as bad a printing money. Actually it's worse, it' puts you in debt the your borrowers i.e. China. Only if every country is free of debt to another will they truly be free.   Just like there are casualties of ware over territory,security, goods and other things, now there is a different war over debt that may require casualties in the name of true freedom. Though these will not be as obvious as soldiers on the battlefeild. They will be the ones who die due to cuts in medical programs and welfare programs.

366,"THANK TO THE SAY NO REPUBLICANS   It is obvious to anyone who looks at the relationship between the Bush family and oil, with gold, and with big money in general, where their personal interests lie. Cheney and Halliburton, anyone associated with Jack Abramoff, Enron, Carl Brizi and Tim Durham, the list goes on and on. And on and on. Are there any democrats with ties to big business? You bet there are. The difference is that democrats, as a body, don’t seek to exploit their elected positions by introducing and voting for legislation to enhance their personal finances and power.   Cons romance the voters in the religious right, and then do next to nothing to advance that agenda. They appeal to the fears of the frightened, even going so far as to manufacture fear in order to do so. They court the angry disenfranchised middle class white voters with tales of welfare fraud and reverse racism. They lie to those that are self-interested, but not completely without a sense of patriotism or concern for their fellow citizens – they help them to believe that lowering taxes for the rich, deregulating business and cutting social programs is good for our economy.   Would Rush Limbaugh, a multi-millionaire, have any reason to have voters believe that the rich should have a lower tax burden? Would Dick Cheney, who is a major stockholder in many corporations and sits on the board for several, have any reason whatsoever to have the voting public believe that business should be free of regulations, thereby increasing profit shares?   Consider the source, and then investigate the evidence, check the historic precedence and then ask yourself who stands to gain?   The Tea Party crowd idolizes the America’s Founders along with today’s corporate titans, whose taxes must be kept low so they can be the great “job creators.” But the contrast is striking, since the Founders risked everything for the country while today’s rich won’t even take the chance of hiring some extra workers, Michael Winship writes.   Today’s corporate giants, blinded by greed, oblivious to the despair around them, are doing much the same. ` Conservative screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd scripted the introductory film at the site’s orientation center. And Sarah Palin paid a visit during her recent bus tour, just a couple of weeks before our arrival, writing on her website that daughter Piper mentioned to her how hard Washington must have worked “to keep that farm going.”  Stephen Colbert responded, “It’s true. I cannot imagine how hard he worked, with no help other than his African volunteers.” The Fortune 500 generated nearly $10.8 trillion in total revenues last year, up 10.5%. Total profits soared 81%. But guess who didn’t benefit much from this giant wave of cash? Millions of U.S. workers stuck mired in a stagnant job market. … We’ve rarely seen such a stark gulf between the fortunes of the 500 and those of ordinary Americans.” Hypocrites, because their radical free market ideology, and the resulting total deregulation of the financial markets, is what caused the debt to spiral out of control this last decade. That and the wars George W. Bush launched but didn’t have the integrity to responsibly finance. The consequence was a banking bubble and crash leading to a 50 percent run-up of the debt that has nothing to do with the “entitlements” that those same Republicans have always wanted to destroy. again according to Erickson, were giving it plenty of credence. In an “open letter” to Congressional Republicans he wrote, “despite what the pundits in Washington are telling you, it is you and not Obama who hold most of the cards...Should the United States lose its bond rating, it will be called the 'Obama Depression.' Congress does not get pinned with this stuff.”   the United States Senate issuing the Levin–Coburn Report found “that the crisis was not a natural disaster, but the result of high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; and the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.”[10][11] Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.[12] The repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks. There is some debate as to what role the repeal of Glass–Steagall had on the late 2000s financial crisis.[13] In response to the financial crisis, both market-based and regulatory solutions have been implemented or are under consideration.[14]  Consider the terrible consequences of the 'anything goes' Bush Administration, whose irresponsible non-regulation of financial institutions has led to this crisis.""  George W Bush - that in the eight years of his presidency he actively pursued policies of deregulation which caused the biggest financial and economic meltdown since the Great Depression.   He certainly presided over a widespread failure of regulation.  On his watch, the US authorities did little to prevent the sale of millions of mortgages to people who could never afford them.  They failed to police the market in mortgage-backed securities which has now collapsed with such devastating consequences.  And credit default swaps, those multi-billion-dollar bets on other people going bust, went virtually unregulated.  In recent days, Congress has been holding hearings to determine how the regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) missed numerous warning signs - ""Red Flags"" - about Bernard Madoff, the man accused of running a gigantic Ponzi scheme which has defrauded investors of at least $50bn.   Deregulation started long before President Bush came to power, and it was enthusiastically pursued by both Democratic and Republican administrations.  Here is just one example:  The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated the activities of commercial banks, which take deposits, from investment banks, which invest money. It was repealed in 1999.  That relaxation of the rules enabled commercial lenders, like Citigroup, to trade instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations.",1,1
1547,"So either  1) you do indeed think it is an accident  OR  2) Your analogy fails as it is being compared to a straw man.   You are attacking a straw man here again.

I don't believe that was what I said. Homo sapien is a species of animals. To be human, one must also possess personhood. According to Dr. Mianna Lotz from the Centre of Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, whom I've had the pleasure to meet recently, ""Personhood is generally defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.""   I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   Conversely, even when the effect of an action is fatal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action itself was wrong.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.   That is an extremely feeble argument. How can someone ignore unforeseen circumstances?",0,1
1096,"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?   A person with Alzheimers has started to lose their awareness, their brain is literally being destroyed. We grant them this exception out of mercy.  However refer to what I said before: laws are not based on reality, but what people feel ought to be. I don't care about what law says.   Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?   When you kill cell, you kill life, but not A LIFE. Same with early-stage abortion.   You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.   I answered you before on this topic: laws are not required to be consistent with each other. That one is allowed and the other forbade is not representative of our stance that a woman ought to have control over her body, but is representative of our legal system's inconsistency.   If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.   I did not say this. I said that how much it is performed has no bearing on whether it should be illegal. This is about granting a woman the ability to terminate her pregnancy, a very personal choice that affects her body. It isn't about punishing women who have abortions commonly.   Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.   Since you're being obtuse, I'll explain this to you explicitly:  Deaths caused by surgical abortion in a hospital (where trained physicians and emergency equipment reside): some number.  Deaths caused by surgical abortion at home (since abortion is illegal and the woman has to operate on herself): higher than the previous number.   Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.   Again, explicit language:  Abortion exists to end unwanted pregnancies. Your concern over repeat abortions is based on personal feelings of morality and a desire to punish irresponsible women, it is irrelevant to the aim of abortion: ending unwanted pregnancies.  Should we ban condoms because some people have dozens of partners and are avoiding the consequences of disease? No. Condoms exist to prevent pregnancy.   It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.   Sorry to disappoint you, but your arguments are all over the place. You have no direction and I have to keep you on topic.  You're free believe that you'll somehow ""beat me,"" but if this is your best caliber of argument style, you'd better just ask me to help you learn how to improve your debate tactics.   Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?   Of course I understand your questions. I can tell you're off topic because whenever you ask a question that appeals to an authority or my emotions rather than the issue at hand, a woman's right to end her pregnancy and the scientific fact that most aborted foetuses cannot be self aware, I know you're obscuring the topic.   I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.   You're still but a child, and could learn a few things from seasoned adults who know much more about these topics than you.   Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality.

675,"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.",1,1

698,"No, this doesn't prove the scenario wrong.   Why does it have to be only female homosexuals? I stated that it is mostly female homosexuals. The scenario is filled with mostly homosexuals because well:   1. That is my scenario and i created it.   2. It is going to prove WHY homosexuality is right.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------   By legal definition, there is a small gap between society and population. However, i am putting them in the same category because the gap is small. According to google definition, the term society means the aggregate of people living together in a small or less ordered community. If people wasn't in a society, hence society will not exist because  1. People create society.   2. The term people is in the definition of society.   You stated: ""According to the OED, ""society"" refers to the 'Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.'"" Without man, this association or society won't even exist. If man died, who is going to continue this association or companionship? Nobody would. Hence, no population means no society.   You stated: ""Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesivness and tolerance..."" First, that is a contradiction. You stated that a society is the association with one's fellow men. So how can it grow independently without man?   I am going give you a task. Build a house and don't allow no family to move in. Nobody is to ever live in that house after it is built. Is that house going to somehow, out of the blue, create family rules or laws? People create society. Society doesn't create itself.   You stated: ""It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow."" I agree that i can't say all societies have that desire. However, you see many times in history books the desire to be free, to work, to live, etc. Im not a historian with all the history classes i took, there were many times when mankind ""didn't want to stop."" They want to continue and grow through science, and technology. So i don't think it is a hasty generalisation. And when i stated ""conquer"" i didn't just mean violence. I also meant growth through science, technology, etc. That was my fault for not being specific.

1446,"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.  First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.  But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.",0,1

But prior to this, they can. Besides, we know that they are human beings anyway. They are independent of a natural host, and would be able to do the things I specified if they weren't afflicted by a condition. My concern is that I doubt a fetus could do those things regardless of condition.    is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance.   Not until the third trimester, in which abortion is illegal anyway. A fetus cannot do any of the things I specified maximally, if at all, prior to the third trimester. It is, by definition, a parasite until about 20 weeks or so.    how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?   Because I obviously disagree that a fetus can do those things.   It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to.   I know that. But when we are talking about defining  human  life, the sexual one is the only definition that matters.    Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.   I'm not disputing that they are alive. I'm disputing on the grounds that asexual reproduction is not human, which is all that needs to be considered.

Most only want 2 or 3 she can still have those 2 or 3 children. At the stage of pregnancy when abortions happen the baby obviously wouldnt be able to live if it was taken out of the womb that early, so is it really considered alive in the womb even if it has a heartbeat. It isn't until the 6th or 7th month that baby might have a chance of surviving if it is taken out early. People say that if it was a mistake you should have been more careful and should deal with it.

The fact is, people without insurance have a 45% higher chance of dying earlier because they don't have insurance. Just about everyone  wants  insurance, again, it is not an issue of ""personal freedom"" and if you've let the trillion dollar insurance industry trick you into thinking that you've been duped.  3. It's absolutely nothing like your example of homeowners insurance, and I think you know that. As you keep complaining the situation is more like making homeowner insurance mandatory for everyone, thus lowering the cost for everyone, thus if the house does catch on fire your life isn't ruined and you do not become a burden on society.  4. I find the assumption that only the ""irresponsible"" don't have insurance very offensive. The vast majority of the uninsured work full time jobs but cannot afford it.  5. Only the healthy think their insurance is any good. There is a very high possibility that before this bill was passed, if you were seriously ill your insurance would have found a reason not to cover or to only cover a portion. It happens/ did happen all of the time.  6. The number one cause of bankruptcy is illness. The majority of these people who go bankrupt thought they had good insurance until they got sick.

Again, like I've explained to Joe a hundred times, the only way  your  insurance is going to change if you are already insured is it will be less expensive, you will get rebates if 85% of the money you pay hasn't been used for health reasons, and your insurance won't be allowed to look for ways to not cover you because of ""pre-existing"" conditions.

1678,"""""Life"" please specify what you mean by the word ""life"".   Sorry what I was referring to was sapience  ""Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.""  What I am trying to get across is that soul is a concept. It’s symbolic of sapience. The concept of soul is key to the philosophical and religious debate about unborn children.   ""Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.""  I was not talking about free will; I am talking about free thought. Free will is the decision to create your own perspective. Free thought defines ones ability to influence its own mindset, create decisions that are not based on instinctual behaviour.   That argument just goes out the window because I did not once mention free-will which is a different concept. The exact phrase I used was “free thinking”.   I feel as if you’re dancing around the concept a bit. I said an unborn baby can’t make any decisions at all, it is completely imamate. Just like a rock, a twig, a leaf, they make no decisions and are only influenced by nature. Yet you’re carrying on about our own free-will.  Yes free-will in the form we know it is an illusion. Our world is only moving in one direction and there is hardly any relativity. However you defeat yourself by saying that statement at all, you deny your own spiritual existence. If you had no free will you would not have wrote that sentence in the first place.   Free-will has no black and white definition. Because if free-will existed I would to be able to do whatever I wanted when I wanted with no consequences but I am restricted to living the life I was giving because of the circumstances of this world. However what you must understand is that free-will is the foundation of our sapience. Without it we are inanimate beings. A mere shell with no occupant.   Most people against abortion are religious fanatics which is why this kind of discussion is appropriate. But you clearly are not. What are you? Are you pro-choice or pro-life or what. It feels like you are dancing between the two.  You made a discussion about sapience and then made a double standard about me not having proof of the existence of a soul?

Should society be responsible for a females irresponsibility?  Another problem I have is the availability. The first thought that comes to the mind is abortion. If the couple feel they will have financial difficulties - abortion is the first answer. Not improving their home economics or getting better jobs. Abortion should always be the last action - not the first.  However in this society I don't think we can live without abortion.

No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds.

Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.

Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens.

Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life.

Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.    It's basic biology. A developing brain is less sophisticated than an adult one, or child one. You take for granted this fact, that the brain develops in stages and each stage has limitations before the progression to the next. An infant cannot understand abstract concepts. A child cannot understand sexuality. A foetus is not aware like we could consider it. It isn't a child agonising over death.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.    If you have nothing well-thought-out to say, then do not speak. This is a debate and thoughtless statements are not appreciated.  Also, learn your place. You have no possession of the female gender. Theirs is not your body to command over and their life is not yours to play fate with.

A child needs love, attention, and it needs to be wanted. Children who are neglected and abused may become criminals. They become broken so they resort to crime and display emotional problems.  Family planning allows us to prevent unwanted children from entering the world.  I feel nothing towards foetal death. It isn't a baby. A baby's death is lamentable because of wasted innocence.

This suggests that you are not fully human until that point, for you are still growing into adulthood. A simpler definition would be that what defines humanity is our identity.

I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State.",1,1

407,"Homosexuality or, gender disorientation is a mental condition. Weather it be environmental, or genetic, because someone feels as if a specific kind of behavior is ""natural"" does not make it so. I know I am going to get some blowback from people saying it was removed from the DSM and you are right, however the facts show that this was done under extreme political pressure and not because doctors dont believe that it is in fact a condition.   You would not help a schizophrenic individual by giving them two cups of tea, one for them and one for their imaginary friend, so why then would you support two men or women getting married? This is what I dont understand. Can homosexuality be treated, maybe. Can it be studied, not objectively as Homosexuals dont want to be fixed they want to be accepted which I completely understand. However, you can accept the behavior without condoning it and this is what America is saying. Yes, you are free to do what you want, but we do not recognize it as being healthy and no, we will not legitimize it by recognizing it through one of our most wildly held social traditions. I believe society as a whole has this right and its important that we do.   On a separate note, I dont think the state should have anything to do with making laws with regards to marriage or recognizing them, however I stand by my original premise that at least attempting to correct the behavior is better than condoning it.",1,0

When you are debating, you automatically forego the right to back your position with religious beliefs, or spiritual beliefs; in other words you agree to reason your position with logic, rationality and evidence. Emotional pleas can be used but they should never serve as the core of your position, because emotional pleas are subjective and go the way the wind blows. Even in a theological debate, one must back their position with orthodox texts.  I am a strictly rational individual, and what you said to me by invoking god is that you have a belief but cannot support it with evidence or reason.

Contraception  fails . I got pregnant on the contraceptive pill which I took correctly, it happens (I didn't abort by the way, but it's just an example). Or do you consider contraception killing of a potential child too?   The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame..   Wow , you're one hell of a sexist! Why does a woman have to take sole responsibility of a pregnancy? How dare you say no one else to blame! The man is just as responsible for the action of sex and creating a life yet he wouldn't get your giant speech on the immorality or creating unwanted life. Not once in the whole discussion have you ever mentioned the males role in creating a baby just how terrible the woman is.   Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube.

Her embryo was placed into a womb and relied on a woman's organs to live. Your statement is all wrong.   If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not   The man is not the issue? Do you realize how many woman get abortions because the person who impregnated them pressured them into doing so? The men often  want  the woman they got pregnant to abort.

There's also no evidence linking homosexuality with pederasty. There is no evidence to link gay households with problem children. Sorry, you're full of shit.  3.

1037,"You know what puzzles me……?  Here we have a picture that the pro-abort side DOES NOT WANT SHOWN. It factually is true and this is how a later term abortion happens. It happens the same way however in earlier abortions…the baby is just smaller. But never the less body parts still are dissected and torn from the fetus alive…until it is dead. So this is the face of abortion…FACT.   What gets me is this. Most everyone here I presume is pro-choice. Why?  They believe that the woman should have the rights to her body and that its a personal decision that only she can make. She should not be burdened by carrying something she does not want…and she may do this for any reason. Abortion should be legal so that if she decides to kill her baby she can.   So why does this picture…upset pro-aborts/choicers? If they embrace abortion for all the right reasons….then what is so wrong with it?   Is killing a living human being bad? No says the pro-choice side. Why the emotion from this side for being called pro-abortion? Is there something your not telling us? Certainly you don't advocate something you find immoral..right?   If abortion should be legal…because its the woman body her decision. Then how many of you would agree that even late term abortions like this….are ok?
